A MIDSUMMER-NIGHT'S DREAM

now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour
draws on apace four happy days bring in
another moon but O methinks how slow
this old moon wanes she lingers my desires
like to a step dame or a dowager
long withering out a young man's revenue

four days will quickly steep themselves in night
four nights will quickly dream away the time
and then the moon like to a silver bow
new-bent in heaven shall behold the night
of our solemnities

go Philostrate
stir up the Athenian youth to merriments
awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
turn melancholy forth to funerals

Hippolyta I woo'd thee with my sword
and won thy love doing thee injuries
but I will wed thee in another key
with pomp with triumph and with revelling


happy be Theseus our renowned duke

thanks good Egeus what's the news with thee

full of vexation come I with complaint
against my child my daughter Hermia
stand forth Demetrius My noble lord
this man hath my consent to marry her
stand forth Lysander and my gracious duke
this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child
thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rimes
and interchang'd love-tokens with my child
with feigning voice verses of feigning love
and stol'n the impression of her fantasy
with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth
with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart
turn'd her obedience which is due to me
to stubborn harshness And my gracious duke
be it so she will not here before your Grace
consent to marry with Demetrius
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens
as she is mine I may dispose of her
which shall be either to this gentleman
or to her death according to our law
immediately provided in that case

what say you Hermia be advis'd fair maid
to you your father should be as a god
one that compos'd your beauties yea and one
by him imprinted and within his power
to leave the figure or disfigure it
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman

so is Lysander

in himself he is
but in this kind wanting your father's voice
the other must be held the worthier

I would my father look'd but with my eyes

rather your eyes must with his judgment look

I do entreat your Grace to pardon me
I know not by what power I am made bold
nor how it may concern my modesty
in such a presence here to plead my thoughts
but I beseech your Grace that I may know
if I refuse to wed Demetrius

either to die the death or to abjure
for ever the society of men
therefore fair Hermia question your desires
know of your youth examine well your blood
whe'r if you yield not to your father's choice
you can endure the livery of a nun
for aye to be in shady cloister mew'd
to live a barren sister all your life
chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
thrice blessed they that master so their blood
to undergo such maiden pilgrimage
but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
than that which withering on the virgin thorn
grows lives and dies in single blessedness

so will I grow so live so die my lord
ere I will yield my virgin patent up
my soul consents not to give sovereignty

take time to pause and by the next new moon
the sealing-day betwixt my love and me
for everlasting bond of fellowship
upon that day either prepare to die
for disobedience to your father's will
or else to wed Demetrius as he would
or on Diana's altar to protest
for aye austerity and single life

relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield
thy crazed title to my certain right

you have her father's love Demetrius
let me have Hermia's do you marry him

scornful Lysander true he hath my love
and what is mine my love shall render him
I do estate unto Demetrius

I am my lord as well deriv'd as he
as well possess'd my love is more than his
my fortunes every way as fairly rank'd
if not with vantage as Demetrius'
and which is more than all these boasts can be
I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia
why should not I then prosecute my right
Demetrius I'll avouch it to his head
made love to Nedar's daughter Helena
and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
upon this spotted and inconstant man

I must confess that I have heard so much
and with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
but being over-full of self-affairs
my mind did lose it But Demetrius come
I have some private schooling for you both
for you fair Hermia look you arm yourself
to fit your fancies to your father's will
or else the law of Athens yields you up
which by no means we may extenuate
to death or to a vow of single life
come my Hippolyta what cheer my love
Demetrius and Egeus go along
I must employ you in some business
against our nuptial and confer with you
of something nearly that concerns yourselves

with duty and desire we follow you


how now my love Why is your cheek so pale
how chance the roses there do fade so fast

belike for want of rain which I could well

ay me for aught that ever I could read
could ever hear by tale or history
the course of true love never did run smooth
but either it was different in blood

O cross too high to be enthrall'd to low

or else misgraffed in respect of years

O spite too old to be engag'd to young

or else it stood upon the choice of friends

O hell to choose love by another's eye

or if there were a sympathy in choice
war death or sickness did lay siege to it
making it momentany as a sound
brief as the lightning in the collied night
that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
and ere a man hath power to say Behold
the jaws of darkness do devour it up
so quick bright things come to confusion

if then true lovers have been ever cross'd
it stands as an edict in destiny
then let us teach our trial patience
because it is a customary cross
as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
wishes and tears poor fancy's followers

a good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia
I have a widow aunt a dowager
of great revenue and she hath no child
from Athens is her house remote seven leagues
and she respects me as her only son
there gentle Hermia may I marry thee
cannot pursue us If thou lov'st me then
steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night
and in the wood a league without the town
where I did meet thee once with Helena
to do observance to a morn of May
there will I stay for thee

my good Lysander
I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow
by his best arrow with the golden head
by the simplicity of Venus' doves
by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
and by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen
when the false Troyan under sail was seen
by all the vows that ever men have broke
in number more than ever women spoke
in that same place thou hast appointed me
to-morrow truly will I meet with thee



God speed fair Helena Whither away

call you me fair that fair again unsay
Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair
your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue's sweet air
more tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear
when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
sickness is catching O were favour so
yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go
my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody
were the world mine Demetrius being bated
the rest I'd give to be to you translated
O teach me how you look and with what art
you sway the motion of Demetrius' heart

I frown upon him yet he loves me still
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill

I give him curses yet he gives me love

O that my prayers could such affection move

the more I hate the more he follows me

the more I love the more he hateth me

his folly Helena is no fault of mine

none but your beauty would that fault were mine

take comfort he no more shall see my face
Lysander and myself will fly this place
before the time I did Lysander see
seem'd Athens as a paradise to me
O then what graces in my love do dwell

Helen to you our minds we will unfold
to-morrow night when Ph be doth behold
her silver visage in the wat'ry glass
decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
a time that lovers' flights doth still conceal
through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal

and in the wood where often you and I
upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie
emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
there my Lysander and myself shall meet
and thence from Athens turn away our eyes
to seek new friends and stranger companies
farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
and good luck grant thee thy Demetrius
keep word Lysander we must starve our sight
from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight


Helena adieu
as you on him Demetrius dote on you


how happy some o'er other some can be
through Athens I am thought as fair as she
but what of that Demetrius thinks not so
he will not know what all but he do know
and as he errs doting on Hermia's eyes
so I admiring of his qualities
things base and vile holding no quantity
love can transpose to form and dignity
love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
and therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind
nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste
wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
and therefore is Love said to be a child
because in choice he is so oft beguil'd
so the boy Love is perjur'd every where
for ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne
he hail'd down oaths that he was only mine
and when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
so he dissolv'd and showers of oaths did melt
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight
then to the wood will he to-morrow night
pursue her and for this intelligence
if I have thanks it is a dear expense
but herein mean I to enrich my pain
to have his sight thither and back again


is all our company here

you were best to call them generally man by man according to the scrip

here is the scroll of every man's name which is thought fit through all Athens to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding-day at night


marry our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby

a very good piece of work I assure you and a merry Now good Peter Quince call forth your actors by the scroll Masters spread yourselves

answer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaver

ready Name what part I am for and proceed

you Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus

what is Pyramus a lover or a tyrant

a lover that kills himself most gallantly for love

that will ask some tears in the true performing of it if I do it let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms I will condole in some measure To the rest yet my chief humour is for a tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all split

the raging rocks
and shivering shocks
of prison gates
and Phibbus' car
shall shine from far
and make and mar
the foolish Fates

this was lofty Now name the rest of the players This is Ercles' vein a tyrant's vein a lover is more condoling

Francis Flute the bellows-mender

here Peter Quince

you must take Thisby on you

what is Thisby a wandering knight

it is the lady that Pyramus must love

nay faith let not me play a woman I have a beard coming
that's all one you shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you will

an I may hide my face let me play Thisby too I'll speak in a monstrous little voice Thisne Thisne Ah Pyramus my lover dear thy Thisby dear and lady dear

no no you must play Pyramus and Flute you Thisby

well proceed

Robin Starveling the tailor

here Peter Quince

Robin Starveling you must play Thisby's mother Tom Snout the tinker

here Peter Quince

you Pyramus's father myself Thisby's father Snug the joiner you the lion's part and I hope here is a play fitted

have you the lion's part written pray you if it be give it me for I am slow of study
you may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring

let me play the lion too I will roar that I will do any man's heart good to hear me I will roar that I will make the duke say Let him roar again let him roar again

an you should do it too terribly you would fright the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us all

that would hang us every mother's son

I grant you friends if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove I will roar you as twere any nightingale

you can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day a most lovely gentleman-like man therefore you must needs play Pyramus

well I will undertake it What beard were I best to play it in

why what you will

I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard your orange-tawny beard your purple-in-grain beard or your French-crown colour beard your perfect yellow

some of your French crowns have no hair at all and then you will play bare-faced But masters here are your parts and I am to entreat you request you and desire you to con them by to-morrow night and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the town by moonlight there will we rehearse for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company and our devices known In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants I pray you fail me not
we will meet and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously Take pains be perfect adieu

at the duke's oak we meet

enough hold or cut bow-strings

how now spirit whither wander you


over hill over dale
thorough bush thorough brier
over park over pale
thorough flood thorough fire
I do wander every where
swifter than the moone's sphere
and I serve the fairy queen
to dew her orbs upon the green
the cowslips tall her pensioners be
in their gold coats spots you see
in their freckles live their savours

I must go seek some dew-drops here
and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear
farewell thou lob of spirits I'll be gone
our queen and all her elves come here anon

the king doth keep his revels here to-night
take heed the queen come not within his sight
for Oberon is passing fell and wrath
because that she as her attendant hath
a lovely boy stol'n from an Indian king
she never had so sweet a changeling
and jealous Oberon would have the child
knight of his train to trace the forests wild
but she perforce withholds the loved boy
crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
and now they never meet in grove or green
by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
creep into acorn-cups and hide them there

either I mistake your shape and making quite
or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
call'd Robin Goodfellow are you not he
that frights the maidens of the villagery
skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
and bootless make the breathless housewife churn
and sometime make the drink to bear no barm
mislead night-wanderers laughing at their harm
those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck
you do their work and they shall have good luck
are you not he

fairy thou speak'st aright
I am that merry wanderer of the night
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
when I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile
neighing in likeness of a filly foal
in very likeness of a roasted crab
and when she drinks against her lips I bob
and on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale
the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me
then slip I from her bum down topples she
and tailor' cries and falls into a cough
and then the whole quire hold their hips and loff
and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
a merrier hour was never wasted there
but room fairy here comes Oberon

and here my mistress Would that he were gone


ill met by moonlight proud Titania

what jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence
I have forsworn his bed and company
tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord

then I must be thy lady but I know
when thou hast stol'n away from fairy land
and in the shape of Corin sat all day
playing on pipes of corn and versing love
to amorous Phillida Why art thou here
come from the furthest steppe of India
but that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love
to Theseus must be wedded and you come
to give their bed joy and prosperity

how canst thou thus for shame Titania
glance at my credit with Hippolyta
knowing I know thy love to Theseus
didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
from Perigouna whom he ravished
and make him with fair gle break his faith

these are the forgeries of jealousy
and never since the middle summer's spring
met we on hill in dale forest or mead
by paved fountain or by rushy brook
or in the beached margent of the sea
to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport
therefore the winds piping to us in vain
as in revenge have suck'd up from the sea
contagious fogs which falling in the land
have every pelting river made so proud
that they have overborne their continents
the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain
the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard
the fold stands empty in the drowned field
and crows are fatted with the murrion flock
the nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud
for lack of tread are undistinguishable
the human mortals want their winter here
no night is now with hymn or carol blest
therefore the moon the governess of floods
pale in her anger washes all the air
that rheumatic diseases do abound
and thorough this distemperature we see
the seasons alter hoary-headed frosts
fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
and on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
is as in mockery set The spring the summer
the childing autumn angry winter change
their wonted liveries and the mazed world
by their increase now knows not which is which
and this same progeny of evil comes
from our debate from our dissension
we are their parents and original

why should Titania cross her Oberon
I do but beg a little changeling boy
to be my henchman

set your heart at rest
the fairy land buys not the child of me
his mother was a votaress of my order
and in the spiced Indian air by night
full often hath she gossip'd by my side
and sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands
marking the embarked traders on the flood
when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind
which she with pretty and with swimming gait
following her womb then rich with my young squire
would imitate and sail upon the land
to fetch me trifles and return again
as from a voyage rich with merchandise
but she being mortal of that boy did die
and for her sake I will not part with him

how long within this wood intend you stay

perchance till after Theseus' weddingday
if you will patiently dance in our round
and see our moonlight revels go with us
if not shun me and I will spare your haunts

give me that boy and I will go with thee

not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away
we shall chide downright if I longer stay


well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
till I torment thee for this injury
my gentle Puck come hither Thou remember'st
since once I sat upon a promontory
uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
that the rude sea grew civil at her song
and certain stars shot madly from their spheres
to hear the sea-maid's music

I remember

that very time I saw but thou couldst not
flying between the cold moon and the earth
Cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took
at a fair vestal throned by the west
and loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow
as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
but I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon
and the imperial votaress passed on
in maiden meditation fancy-free
yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell
it fell upon a little western flower
and maidens call it Love-in-idleness
fetch me that flower the herb I show'd thee once
the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
will make or man or woman madly dote
upon the next live creature that it sees
fetch me this herb and be thou here again
ere the leviathan can swim a league

I'll put a girdle round about the earth
in forty minutes


having once this juice
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep
and drop the liquor of it in her eyes
the next thing then she waking looks upon
be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
on meddling monkey or on busy ape
she shall pursue it with the soul of love
as I can take it with another herb
I'll make her render up her page to me
but who comes here I am invisible
and I will overhear their conference


I love thee not therefore pursue me not
where is Lysander and fair Hermia
the one I'll slay the other slayeth me
thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood
and here am I and wood within this wood
because I cannot meet my Hermia
hence get thee gone and follow me no more

you draw me you hard-hearted adamant
but yet you draw not iron for my heart
is true as steel leave you your power to draw
and I shall have no power to follow you

or rather do I not in plainest truth
tell you I do not nor I cannot love you

and even for that do I love you the more
I am your spaniel and Demetrius
the more you beat me I will fawn on you
use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
neglect me lose me only give me leave
unworthy as I am to follow you
what worser place can I beg in your love
and yet a place of high respect with me
than to be used as you use your dog

tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
for I am sick when I do look on you

and I am sick when I look not on you

you do impeach your modesty too much
into the hands of one that loves you not
to trust the opportunity of night
and the ill counsel of a desert place
with the rich worth of your virginity

your virtue is my privilege for that
it is not night when I do see your face
therefore I think I am not in the night
nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
for you in my respect are all the world
then how can it be said I am alone
when all the world is here to look on me

I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts

the wildest hath not such a heart as you
run when you will the story shall be chang'd
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase
makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
when cowardice pursues and valour flies

I will not stay thy questions let me go
or if thou follow me do not believe
but I shall do thee mischief in the wood

ay in the temple in the town the field
you do me mischief Fie Demetrius
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
we cannot fight for love as men may do
we should be woo'd and were not made to woo

I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
to die upon the hand I love so well


fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer

ay there it is

I pray thee give it me
I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows
where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine
with sweet musk-roses and with eglantine
there sleeps Titania some time of the night
lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight
and there the snake throws her enamell'd skin
weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
and with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes
and make her full of hateful fantasies
take thou some of it and seek through this grove
a sweet Athenian lady is in love
with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
but do it when the next thing he espies
by the Athenian garments he hath on
effect it with some care that he may prove
more fond on her than she upon her love
and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow

fear not my lord your servant shall do so


come now a roundel and a fairy song
then for the third of a minute hence
some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds
some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings
to make my small elves coats and some keep back
the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
at our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep
then to your offices and let me rest

the Fairies sing

I 

you spotted snakes with double tongue
thorny hedge-hogs be not seen
newts and blind-worms do no wrong
come not near our fairy queen
Philomel with melody
sing in our sweet lullaby
lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
never harm
nor spell nor charm
come our lovely lady nigh
so good night with lullaby

II 

weaving spiders come not here
hence you long-legg'd spinners hence
beetles black approach not near
Philomel with melody &c


hence away now all is well
one aloof stand sentinel

what thou seest when thou dost wake
do it for thy true-love take
love and languish for his sake
be it ounce or cat or bear
pard or boar with bristled hair
in thy eye that shall appear
when thou wak'st it is thy dear
wake when some vile thing is near

fair love you faint with wandering in the wood
and to speak troth I have forgot our way
we'll rest us Hermia if you think it good
and tarry for the comfort of the day
be it so Lysander find you out a bed
for I upon this bank will rest my head

one turf shall serve as pillow for us both
one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth

nay good Lysander for my sake my dear
lie further off yet do not lie so near

O take the sense sweet of my innocence
love takes the meaning in love's conference
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit
so that but one heart we can make of it
two bosoms interchained with an oath
so then two bosoms and a single troth
then by your side no bed-room me deny
for lying so Hermia I do not lie

Lysander riddles very prettily
if Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
but gentle friend for love and courtesy
lie further off in human modesty
such separation as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
so far be distant and good night sweet friend
thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end

amen amen to that fair prayer say I
and then end life when I end loyalty

here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest

with half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd


through the forest have I gone
but Athenian found I none
on whose eyes I might approve
night and silence who is here
weeds of Athens he doth wear
this is he my master said
despised the Athenian maid
and here the maiden sleeping sound
on the dank and dirty ground
pretty soul she durst not lie
near this lack-love this kill-courtesy

churl upon thy eyes I throw
all the power this charm doth owe
when thou wak'st let love forbid
sleep his seat on thy eyelid
so awake when I am gone
for I must now to Oberon


stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius


O wilt thou darkling leave me do not so

stay on thy peril I alone will go


O I am out of breath in this fond chase
the more my prayer the lesser is my grace
happy is Hermia wheresoe'er she lies
for she hath blessed and attractive eyes
how came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears
if so my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers
no no I am as ugly as a bear
for beasts that meet me run away for fear
therefore no marvel though Demetrius
do as a monster fly my presence thus
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne
but who is here Lysander on the ground
Lysander if you live good sir awake

and run through fire I will for thy sweet sake
transparent Helena Nature shows art
that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
where is Demetrius O how fit a word
is that vile name to perish on my sword

do not say so Lysander say not so
what though he love your Hermia Lord what though
yet Hermia still loves you then be content

content with Hermia No I do repent
the tedious minutes I with her have spent
not Hermia but Helena I love
who will not change a raven for a dove
the will of man is by his reason sway'd
and reason says you are the worthier maid
things growing are not ripe until their season
and touching now the point of human skill
reason becomes the marshal to my will
and leads me to your eyes where I o'erlook
love's stories written in love's richest book

wherefore was I to this keen mockery born
when at your hands did I deserve this scorn
is't not enough is't not enough young man
that I did never no nor never can
deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye
but you must flout my insufficiency
good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
in such disdainful manner me to woo
but fare you well perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness
O that a lady of one man refus'd
should of another therefore be abus'd


and never mayst thou come Lysander near
for as a surfeit of the sweetest things
the deepest loathing to the stomach brings
or as the heresies that men do leave
are hated most of those they did deceive
so thou my surfeit and my heresy
of all be hated but the most of me
and all my powers address your love and might
to honour Helen and to be her knight


help me Lysander help me do thy best
to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
ay me for pity what a dream was here
Lysander look how I do quake with fear
methought a serpent eat my heart away
and you sat smiling at his cruel prey
Lysander what remov'd Lysander lord
what out of hearing gone no sound no word
speak of all loves I swound almost with fear
no then I well perceive you are not nigh
either death or you I'll find immediately

are we all met

pat pat and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal This green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke

Peter Quince

what sayst thou bully Bottom

there are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide How answer you that

by'r lakin a parlous fear

I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done

not a whit I have a device to make all well Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that Pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear
well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six

no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight

will not the ladies be afeard of the lion

I fear it I promise you

masters you ought to consider with yourselves to bring in God shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living and we ought to look to it

therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion

nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect Ladies or Fair ladies I would wish you or I would request you or I would entreat you not to fear not to tremble my life for yours If you think I come hither as a lion it were pity of my life no I am no such thing I am a man as other men are and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner

well it shall be so But there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight

doth the moon shine that night we play our play

a calendar a calendar look in the almanack find out moonshine find out moonshine
yes it doth shine that night

why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement

ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine Then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did talk through the chink of a wall

you can never bring in a wall What say you Bottom

some man or other must present Wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough-cast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper

if that may be than all is well Come sit down every mother's son and rehearse your parts Pyramus you begin when you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so every one according to his cue


what hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here
so near the cradle of the fairy queen
what a play toward I'll be an auditor
an actor too perhaps if I see cause

speak Pyramus Thisby stand forth
Thisby the flowers have odious savours sweet

odorous odorous

odours savours sweet
so hath thy breath my dearest Thisby dear But hark a voice stay thou but here awhile
and by and by I will to thee appear


a stranger Pyramus than e'er play'd here


must I speak now

ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again

most radiant Pyramus most lily-white of hue
of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier
most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew
I'll meet thee Pyramus at Ninny's tomb

'Ninus' tomb man Why you must not speak that yet that you answer to Pyramus you speak all your part at once cues and all Pyramus enter your cue is past it is never tire

O As true as truest horse that yet would never tire


if I were fair Thisby I were only thine

O monstrous O strange we are haunted
pray masters fly masters Help


I'll follow you I'll lead you about a round
through bog through bush through brake through brier
sometime a horse I'll be sometime a hound
a hog a headless bear sometime a fire
and neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn
like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn

why do they run away this is a knavery of them to make me afeard


O Bottom thou art changed what do I see on thee

what do you see you see an ass-head of your own do you

bless thee Bottom bless thee thou art translated


I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could But I will not stir from this place do what they can I will walk up and down here and I will sing that they shall hear I am not afraid

the ousel-cock so black of hue
with orange-tawny bill
the throstle with his note so true
the wren with little quill




the finch the sparrow and the lark
the plain-song cuckoo gray
whose note full many a man doth mark
and dares not answer nay

for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry cuckoo' never so

I pray thee gentle mortal sing again
mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note
so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
on the first view to say to swear I love thee

methinks mistress you should have little reason for that and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together now-a-days The more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends Nay I can gleek upon occasion

thou art as wise as thou art beautiful


out of this wood do not desire to go
thou shalt remain here whe'r thou wilt or no
I am a spirit of no common rate
the summer still doth tend upon my state
and I do love thee therefore go with me
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
and I will purge thy mortal grossness so
that thou shalt like an airy spirit go
Pease-blossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed


ready

and I

and I
and I

where shall we go

be kind and courteous to this gentleman
hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
feed him with apricocks and dewberries
with purple grapes green figs and mulberries
the honey-bags steal from the humble-bees
and for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
and light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes
to have my love to bed and to arise
and pluck the wings from painted butterflies
to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
nod to him elves and do him courtesies

hail mortal

hail
hail

hail

I cry your worships mercy heartily I beseech your worship's name

Cobweb

I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master Cobweb if I out my finger I shall make bold with you Your name honest gentleman

Pease-blossom

I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your mother and to Master Peascod your father Good Master Pease-blossom I shall desire you of more acquaintance too Your name I beseech you sir

Mustard-seed

good Master Mustard-seed I know your patience well that same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now I desire you of more acquaintance good Master Mustard-seed

come wait upon him lead him to my bower
and when she weeps weeps every little flower
lamenting some enforced chastity
tie up my love's tongue bring him silently


I wonder if Titania be awak'd
then what it was that next came in her eye
which she must dote on in extremity
here comes my messenger


how now mad spirit

what night-rule now about this haunted grove

my mistress with a monster is in love
near to her close and consecrated bower
while she was in her dull and sleeping hour
a crew of patches rude mechanicals
were met together to rehearse a play
intended for great Theseus' nuptial day
the shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort
who Pyramus presented in their sport
forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
when I did him at this advantage take
an ass's nowl I fixed on his head
anon his Thisbe must be answered
and forth my mimick comes When they him spy
as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
or russet-pated choughs many in sort
rising and cawing at the gun's report
sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
so at his sight away his fellows fly
and at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls
he murder cries and help from Athens calls
their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong
made senseless things begin to do them wrong
for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
I led them on in this distracted fear
and left sweet Pyramus translated there
when in that moment so it came to pass
Titania wak'd and straightway lov'd an ass

this falls out better than I could devise
but hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
with the love-juice as I did bid thee do

I took him sleeping that is finish'd too
and the Athenian woman by his side
that when he wak'd of force she must be ey'd


stand close this is the same Athenian

this is the woman but not this the man

O why rebuke you him that loves you so

now I but chide but I should use thee worse
for thou I fear hast given me cause to curse
if thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep
being o'er shoes in blood plunge in knee deep
and kill me too
the sun was not so true unto the day
as he to me Would he have stol'n away
from sleeping Hermia I'll believe as soon
this whole earth may be bor'd and that the moon
may through the centre creep and so displease
her brother's noontide with the Antipodes
it cannot be but thou hast murder'd him
so should a murderer look so dead so grim

so should the murder'd look and so should I
pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty
yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
as yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere
what's this to my Lysander where is he
Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me

I had rather give his carcass to my hounds

out dog out cur thou driv'st me past the bounds
of maiden's patience Hast thou slain him then
henceforth be never number'd among men
O once tell true tell true e'en for my sake
durst thou have look'd upon him being awake
and hast thou kill'd him sleeping O brave touch
could not a worm an adder do so much
an adder did it for with doubler tongue
than thine thou serpent never adder stung

you spend your passion on a mispris'd mood
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood
nor is he dead for aught that I can tell


an if I could what should I get therefore

a privilege never to see me more
and from thy hated presence part I so
see me no more whe'r he be dead or no


there is no following her in this fierce vein
here therefore for awhile I will remain
so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
which now in some slight measure it will pay
if for his tender here I make some stay


what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
and laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight
of thy misprision must perforce ensue

then fate o'er-rules that one man holding troth
a million fail confounding oath on oath

about the wood go swifter than the wind
and Helena of Athens look thou find
all fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer
with sighs of love that cost the fresh blood dear
by some illusion see thou bring her here
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear

I go I go look how I go
swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow

flower of this purple dye
hit with Cupid's archery
sink in apple of his eye
when his love he doth espy
let her shine as gloriously
when thou wak'st if she be by
beg of her for remedy


captain of our fairy band
Helena is here at hand
and the youth mistook by me
pleading for a lover's fee
shall we their fond pageant see
lord what fools these mortals be

stand aside the noise they make
will cause Demetrius to awake

then will two at once woo one
that must needs be sport alone
and those things do best please me
that befall preposterously

scorn and derision never come in tears
look when I vow I weep and vows so born
in their nativity all truth appears
how can these things in me seem scorn to you
bearing the badge of faith to prove them true

you do advance your cunning more and more
when truth kills truth O devilish-holy fray
these vows are Hermia's will you give her o'er
weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
your vows to her and me put in two scales
will even weigh and both as light as tales

I had no judgment when to her I swore

nor none in my mind now you give her o'er

Demetrius loves her and he loves not you

to what my love shall I compare thine eyne
crystal is muddy O how ripe in show
thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
this pure congealed white high Taurus' snow
fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
when thou hold'st up thy hand O let me kiss
that princess of pure white this seal of bliss

O spite O hell I see you all are bent
to set against me for your merriment
if you were civil and knew courtesy
you would not do me thus much injury
can you not hate me as I know you do
but you must join in souls to mock me too
if you were men as men you are in show
you would not use a gentle lady so
to vow and swear and superpraise my parts
when I am sure you hate me with your hearts
you both are rivals and love Hermia
a trim exploit a manly enterprise
to conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
with your derision none of noble sort
would so offend a virgin and extort
a poor soul's patience all to make you sport

you are unkind Demetrius be not so
for you love Hermia this you know I know
and here with all good will with all my heart
in Hermia's love I yield you up my part
and yours of Helena to me bequeath
whom I do love and will do to my death

never did mockers waste more idle breath

Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none
if e'er I lov'd her all that love is gone
my heart with her but as guest wise sojourn'd
and now to Helen it is home return'd

Helen it is not so

disparage not the faith thou dost not know
lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear


dark night that from the eye his function takes
the ear more quick of apprehension makes
wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
it pays the hearing double recompense
thou art not by mine eye Lysander found
mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound
but why unkindly didst thou leave me so

why should he stay whom love doth press to go

what love could press Lysander from my side
Lysander's love that would not let him bide
fair Helena who more engilds the night
than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know
the hate I bear thee made me leave thee so

you speak not as you think it cannot be

lo she is one of this confederacy
now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
to fashion this false sport in spite of me
injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid
have you conspir'd have you with these contriv'd
to bait me with this foul derision
is all the counsel that we two have shar'd
the sister-vows the hours that we have spent
when we have chid the hasty-footed time
for parting us O is it all forgot
all school-days' friendship childhood innocence
have with our neelds created both one flower
both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
both warbling of one song both in one key
as if our hands our sides voices and minds
had been incorporate So we grew together
like to a double cherry seeming parted
but yet an union in partition
two lovely berries moulded on one stem
so with two seeming bodies but one heart
two of the first like coats in heraldry
due but to one and crowned with one crest
and will you rent our ancient love asunder
to join with men in scorning your poor friend
it is not friendly tis not maidenly
our sex as well as I may chide you for it
though I alone do feel the injury

I am amazed at your passionate words
I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
have you not set Lysander as in scorn
to follow me and praise my eyes and face
and made your other love Demetrius
who even but now did spurn me with his foot
to call me goddess nymph divine and rare
precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this
to her he hates and wherefore doth Lysander
deny your love so rich within his soul
and tender me forsooth affection
but by your setting on by your consent
what though I be not so in grace as you
so hung upon with love so fortunate
but miserable most to love unlov'd
this you should pity rather than despise

I understand not what you mean by this

ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
make mouths upon me when I turn my back
this sport well carried shall be chronicled
if you have any pity grace or manners
you would not make me such an argument
but fare ye well tis partly mine own fault
which death or absence soon shall remedy

stay gentle Helena hear my excuse
my love my life my soul fair Helena

O excellent

sweet do not scorn her so

if she cannot entreat I can compel

thou canst compel no more than she entreat
thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
Helen I love thee by my life I do
I swear by that which I will lose for thee

I say I love thee more than he can do

if thou say so withdraw and prove it too

quick come

Lysander whereto tends all this

away you Ethiop

no no he'll
seem to break loose take on as you would follow
but yet come not you are a tame man go

hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
or I will shake thee from me like a serpent

why are you grown so rude what change is this

thy love out tawny Tartar out
out loathed medicine hated poison hence

do you not jest

yes sooth and so do you

Demetrius I will keep my word with thee

I would I had your bond for I perceive
a weak bond holds you I'll not trust your word

what should I hurt her strike her kill her dead
although I hate her I'll not harm her so

what can you do me greater harm than hate
hate me wherefore O me what news my love
am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander
since night you lov'd me yet since night you left me
why then you left me O the gods forbid
in earnest shall I say

ay by my life
and never did desire to see thee more
therefore be out of hope of question doubt
be certain nothing truer tis no jest
that I do hate thee and love Helena

O me you juggler you canker-blossom
you thief of love what have you come by night
and stol'n my love's heart from him

fine i' faith
have you no modesty no maiden shame
no touch of bashfulness What will you tear
impatient answers from my gentle tongue
fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
puppet why so ay that way goes the game
now I perceive that she hath made compare
between our statures she hath urg'd her height
and with her personage her tall personage
her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him
and are you grown so high in his esteem
because I am so dwarfish and so low
how low am I thou painted maypole speak
how low am I I am not yet so low
but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes

I pray you though you mock me gentlemen
let her not hurt me I was never curst
I have no gift at all in shrewishness
I am a right maid for my cowardice
let her not strike me You perhaps may think
because she is something lower than myself
that I can match her


good Hermia do not be so bitter with me
I evermore did love you Hermia
did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you
save that in love unto Demetrius
I told him of your stealth unto this wood
he follow'd you for love I follow'd him
but he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
and now so you will let me quiet go
to Athens will I bear my folly back
and follow you no further let me go
you see how simple and how fond I am

why get you gone Who is't that hinders you

a foolish heart that I leave here behind

what with Lysander
with Demetrius

be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena

no sir she shall not though you take her part

O when she's angry she is keen and shrewd
she was a vixen when she went to school
and though she be but little she is fierce

'Little' again nothing but low' and little
why will you suffer her to flout me thus
let me come to her

get you gone you dwarf
you minimus of hindering knot-grass made
you bead you acorn

you are too officious
let her alone speak not of Helena
take not her part for if thou dost intend
never so little show of love to her
thou shalt aby it

now she holds me not
now follow if thou dar'st to try whose right
or thine or mine is most in Helena

follow nay I'll go with thee cheek by jole


you mistress all this coil is long of you
nay go not back

I will not trust you I
nor longer stay in your curst company
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
my legs are longer though to run away

I am amaz'd and know not what to say


this is thy negligence still thou mistak'st
or else commit'st thy knaveries wilfully

believe me king of shadows I mistook
did not you tell me I should know the man
by the Athenian garments he had on
and so far blameless proves my enterprise
that I have nointed an Athenian's eyes
and so far am I glad it so did sort
as this their jangling I esteem a sport

thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight
hie therefore Robin overcast the night
the starry welking cover thou anon
with drooping fog as black as Acheron
as one come not within another's way
like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue
then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong
and sometime rail thou like Demetrius
and from each other look thou lead them thus
till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
then crush this herb into Lysander's eye
whose liquor hath this virtuous property
to take from thence all error with his might
and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
when they next wake all this derision
shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
and back to Athens shall the lovers wend
with league whose date till death shall never end
whiles I in this affair do thee employ
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy
and then I will her charmed eye release
from monster's view and all things shall be peace
my fairy lord this must be done with haste
for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
and yonder shines Aurora's harbinger
at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
troop home to churchyards damned spirits all
that in cross-ways and floods have burial
already to their wormy beds are gone
for fear lest day should look their shames upon
they wilfully themselves exile from light
and must for aye consort with black-brow'd night

but we are spirits of another sort
I with the morning's love have oft made sport
and like a forester the groves may tread
even till the eastern gate all fiery-red
opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams
turns into yellow gold his salt green-streams
but notwithstanding haste make no delay
we may effect this business yet ere day
up and down up and down
I will lead them up and down
I am fear'd in field and town
goblin lead them up and down

here comes one


where art thou proud Demetrius speak thou now

here villain drawn and ready Where art thou

I will be with thee straight

follow me then
to plainer ground

Lysander speak again
thou runaway thou coward art thou fled

thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars
and wilt not come Come recreant come thou child
I'll whip thee with a rod he is defil'd
that draws a sword on thee

yea art thou there

follow my voice we'll try no manhood here

he goes before me and still dares me on
when I come where he calls then he is gone
the villain is much lighter-heel'd than I
I follow'd fast but faster he did fly
that fallen am I in dark uneven way
and here will rest me

come thou gentle day
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite

ho ho ho Coward why com'st thou not

abide me if thou dar'st for well I wot
thou runn'st before me shifting every place
and dar'st not stand nor look me in the face
where art thou now

come hither I am here

nay then thou mock'st me Thou shalt buy this dear
if ever I thy face by daylight see
now go thy way Faintness constraineth me
to measure out my length on this cold bed
by day's approach look to be visited

O weary night O long and tedious night
abate thy hours shine comforts from the east
from these that my poor company detest
and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye
steal me awhile from mine own company

yet but three Come one more
two of both kinds make up four
here she comes curst and sad
Cupid is a knavish lad
thus to make poor females mad

never so weary never so in woe
bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
I can no further crawl no further go
my legs can keep no pace with my desires
here will I rest me till the break of day
heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray

on the ground
sleep sound
to your eye
gentle lover remedy

when thou wak'st
thou tak'st
true delight
in the sight
of thy former lady's eye
and the country proverb known
that every man should take his own
in your waking shall be shown
Jack shall have Jill
nought shall go ill
the man shall have his mare again
and all shall be well


come sit thee down upon this flowery bed
while I thy amiable cheeks do coy
and kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy

where's Pease-blossom

ready

scratch my head Pease-blossom Where's Mounsieur Cobweb

ready

mounsieur Cobweb good mounsieur get your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle and good mounsieur bring me the honey-bag Do not fret yourself too much in the action mounsieur and good mounsieur have a care the honey-bag break not I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag signior Where's Mounsieur Mustard-seed

ready

give me your neaf Mounsieur Mustard-seed Pray you leave your curtsy good mounsieur

what's your will

nothing good mounsieur but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch I must to the barber's mounsieur for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face and I am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch
what wilt thou hear some music my sweet love

I have a reasonable good ear in music let us have the tongs and the bones

or say sweet love what thou desir'st to eat

truly a peck of provender I could munch your good dry oats Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay good hay sweet hay hath no fellow

I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
the squirrel's hoard and fetch thee thence new nuts

I had rather have a handful or two of dried pease But I pray you let none of your people stir me I have an exposition of sleep come upon me

sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms
fairies be gone and be all ways away

so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
gently entwist the female ivy so
enrings the barky fingers of the elm

welcome good Robin See'st thou this sweet sight
her dotage now I do begin to pity
for meeting her of late behind the wood
seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool
I did upbraid her and fall out with her
for she his hairy temples then had rounded
with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
and that same dew which sometime on the buds
was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
when I had at my pleasure taunted her
and she in mild terms begg'd my patience
I then did ask of her her changeling child
which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
to bear him to my bower in fairy land
and now I have the boy I will undo
this hateful imperfection of her eyes
from off the head of this Athenian swain
that he awaking when the other do
may all to Athens back again repair
and think no more of this night's accidents
but as the fierce vexation of a dream
but first I will release the fairy queen


be as thou wast wont to be
see as thou wast wont to see
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
hath such force and blessed power

now my Titania wake you my sweet queen

my Oberon what visions have I seen
methought I was enamour'd of an ass

there lies your love
how came these things to pass
O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now

silence awhile Robin take off this head
Titania music call and strike more dead
than common sleep of all these five the sense

music ho music such as charmeth sleep


when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peep

sound music

come my queen take hands with me
and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
now thou and I are new in amity
and will to-morrow midnight solemnly
dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly
there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
wedded with Theseus all in jollity


fairy king attend and mark
I do hear the morning lark

then my queen in silence sad
trip we after the night's shade
we the globe can compass soon
swifter than the wandering moon

come my lord and in our flight
tell me how it came this night
that I sleeping here was found
with these mortals on the ground


go one of you find out the forester
and since we have the vaward of the day
my love shall hear the music of my hounds
uncouple in the western valley let them go
dispatch I say and find the forester
we will fair queen up to the mountain's top
and mark the musical confusion
of hounds and echo in conjunction

I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
when in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
with hounds of Sparta never did I hear
such gallant chiding for besides the groves
the skies the fountains every region near
seem'd all one mutual cry I never heard
so musical a discord such sweet thunder

my hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind
so flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung
with ears that sweep away the morning dew
slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells
each under each A cry more tuneable
was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn
in Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly
judge when you hear But soft what nymphs are these

my lord this is my daughter here asleep
and this Lysander this Demetrius is
this Helena old Nedar's Helena
I wonder of their being here together

no doubt they rose up early to observe
the rite of May and hearing our intent
came here in grace of our solemnity
but speak Egeus is not this the day
that Hermia should give answer of her choice

it is my lord



good morrow friends Saint Valentine is past

begin these wood-birds but to couple now

pardon my lord


I pray you all stand up
I know you two are rival enemies
how comes this gentle concord in the world
that hatred is so far from jealousy
to sleep by hate and fear no enmity

my lord I shall reply amazedly
half sleep half waking but as yet I swear
I cannot truly say how I came here
but as I think for truly would I speak
I came with Hermia hither our intent
was to be gone from Athens where we might
without the peril of the Athenian law

enough enough my lord you have enough
I beg the law the law upon his head
they would have stol'n away they would Demetrius
thereby to have defeated you and me
you of your wife and me of my consent
of my consent that she should be your wife

my lord fair Helen told me of their stealth
of this their purpose hither to this wood
and I in fury hither follow'd them
fair Helena in fancy following me
but my good lord I wot not by what power
but by some power it is my love to Hermia
melted as doth the snow seems to me now
as the remembrance of an idle gaud
and all the faith the virtue of my heart
the object and the pleasure of mine eye
is only Helena To her my lord
was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia
but like in sickness did I loathe this food
but as in health come to my natural taste
now do I wish it love it long for it
and will for evermore be true to it

fair lovers you are fortunately met
of this discourse we more will hear anon
Egeus I will overbear your will
for in the temple by and by with us
these couples shall eternally be knit
and for the morning now is something worn
our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside
away with us to Athens three and three
we'll hold a feast in great solemnity
come Hippolyta

these things seem small and undistinguishable
like far-off mountains turned into clouds

methinks I see these things with parted eye
when everything seems double

so methinks
and I have found Demetrius like a jewel
mine own and not mine own

are you sure
that we are awake It seems to me
that yet we sleep we dream Do you not think
the duke was here and bid us follow him

yea and my father

and Hippolyta
and he did bid us follow to the temple

why then we are awake Let's follow him
and by the way let us recount our dreams


when my cue comes call me and I will answer my next is Most fair Pyramus Heigh-ho Peter Quince Flute the bellows-mender Snout the tinker Starveling God's my life stolen hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream Methought I was there is no man can tell what Methought I was and methought I had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had The eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called Bottom's Dream because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her death


have you sent to Bottom's house is he come home yet

he cannot be heard of Out of doubt he is transported

if he come not then the play is marred it goes not forward doth it

it is not possible you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he

no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens


you must say paragon a paramour is God bless us a thing of naught


masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone forward we had all been made men

O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus I'll be hanged he would have deserved it sixpence a day in Pyramus or nothing


where are these lads where are these hearts

bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour

masters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if I tell you I am no true Athenian I will tell you everything right as it fell out

let us hear sweet Bottom

not a word of me All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined Get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred In any case let Thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion's claws And most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy No more words away go away


more strange than true I never may believe
these antique fables nor these fairy toys
lovers and madmen have such seething brains
such shaping fantasies that apprehend
more than cool reason ever comprehends
the lunatic the lover and the poet
are of imagination all compact
one sees more devils than vast hell can hold
that is the madman the lover all as frantic
sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt
the poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling
doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
and as imagination bodies forth
the forms of things unknown the poet's pen
turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
a local habitation and a name
such tricks hath strong imagination
that if it would but apprehend some joy
or in the night imagining some fear
how easy is a bush suppos'd a bear

but all the story of the night told over
and all their minds transfigur'd so together
more witnesseth than fancy's images
and grows to something of great constancy
but howsoever strange and admirable

here come the lovers full of joy and mirth


joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love

accompany your hearts

more than to us
wait in your royal walks your board your bed

to wear away this long age of three hours
between our after-supper and bed-time
where is our usual manager of mirth
what revels are in hand Is there no play
to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
call Philostrate

here mighty Theseus

say what abridgment have you for this evening
what masque what music How shall we beguile
the lazy time if not with some delight

there is a brief how many sports are ripe
make choice of which your highness will see first


the battle with the Centaurs to be sung
by an Athenian eunuch to the harp
in glory of my kinsman Hercules
the riot of the tipsy Bacchanals
tearing the Thracian singer in their rage
that is an old device and it was play'd
when I from Thebes came last a conqueror
the thrice three Muses mourning for the death
of Learning late deceas'd in beggary
that is some satire keen and critical
not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
a tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
and his love Thisbe very tragical mirth
merry and tragical tedious and brief
that is hot ice and wonderous strange snow
how shall we find the concord of this discord

a play there is my lord some ten words long
which is as brief as I have known a play
but by ten words my lord it is too long
which makes it tedious for in all the play
and tragical my noble lord it is
for Pyramus therein doth kill himself
which when I saw rehears'd I must confess
made mine eyes water but more merry tears
the passion of loud laughter never shed

what are they that do play it

hard-handed men that work in Athens here
which never labour'd in their minds till now
and now have toil'd their unbreath'd memories
with this same play against your nuptial

and we will hear it

no my noble lord
it is not for you I have heard it over
and it is nothing nothing in the world
unless you can find sport in their intents
to do you service

I will hear that play
for never anything can be amiss
when simpleness and duty tender it
go bring them in and take your places ladies


I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharg'd
and duty in his service perishing

why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing

he says they can do nothing in this kind

the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
our sport shall be to take what they mistake
and what poor duty cannot do noble respect
takes it in might not merit
to greet me with premeditated welcomes
where I have seen them shiver and look pale
make periods in the midst of sentences
throttle their practis'd accent in their fears
and in conclusion dumbly have broke off
not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet
out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome
and in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
of saucy and audacious eloquence
love therefore and tongue-tied simplicity
in least speak most to my capacity


so please your Grace the Prologue is address'd

let him approach


that you should think we come not to offend
but with good will To show our simple skill
that is the true beginning of our end
consider then we come but in despite
we do not come as minding to content you
our true intent is All for your delight
we are not here That you should here repent you
the actors are at hand and by their show
you shall know all that you are like to know


this fellow doth not stand upon points

he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true

indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government

his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered Who is next

gentles perchance you wonder at this show
but wonder on till truth make all things plain
this man is Pyramus if you would know
this beauteous lady Thisby is certain
this man with lime and rough-cast doth present
wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder
and through Wall's chink poor souls they are content
to whisper at the which let no man wonder
this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
presenteth Moonshine for if you will know
by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
to meet at Ninus' tomb there there to woo
this grisly beast which Lion hight by name
the trusty Thisby coming first by night
did scare away or rather did affright
and as she fied her mantle she did fall
which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall
and finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain
he bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast
and Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
his dagger drew and died For all the rest
let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain
at large discourse while here they do remain


I wonder if the lion be to speak

no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
wall In this same interlude it doth befall
that I one Snout by name present a wall
and such a wall as I would have you think
that had in it a crannied hole or chink
through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby
did whisper often very secretly
this loam this rough-cast and this stone doth show
that I am that same wall the truth is so
and this the cranny is right and sinister

would you desire lime and hair to speak better

it is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lord

Pyramus draws near the wall silence


O grim-look'd night O night with hue so black
O night which ever art when day is not
O night O night alack alack alack
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot
and thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall
that stand'st between her father's ground and mine
thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall
show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne

thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this
but what see I No Thisby do I see
curs'd be thy stones for thus deceiving me

the wall methinks being sensible should curse again

no in truth sir he should not Deceiving me is Thisby's cue she is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall You shall see it will fall pat as I told you Yonder she comes


O wall full often hast thou heard my moans
for parting my fair Pyramus and me
my cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones
thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee

I see a voice now will I to the chink
to spy an I can hear my Thisby's face
Thisby

my love thou art my love I think

think what thou wilt I am thy lover's grace

and I like Helen till the Fates me kill

not Shafalus to Procrus was so true

as Shafalus to Procrus I to you

O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall

I kiss the wall's hole not your lips at all

wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway

'Tide life tide death I come without delay


thus have I Wall my part discharged so
and being done thus Wall away doth go

now is the mural down between the two neighbours

no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning

this is the silliest stuff that ever I heard

the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them

it must be your imagination then and not theirs

if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion


you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
may now perchance both quake and tremble here
when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
then know that I one Snug the joiner am
a lion-fell nor else no lion's dam
into this place twere pity on my life

a very gentle beast and of a good conscience

the very best at a beast my lord that e'er I saw

this lion is a very fox for his valour

true and a goose for his discretion

not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose

his discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox It is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon

this lanthorn doth the horned moon present

he should have worn the horns on his head

he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference
this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
myself the man i' the moon do seem to be

this is the greatest error of all the rest
the man should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the man i' the moon

he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff

I am aweary of this moon would he would change

it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time

proceed Moon

all that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the man in the moon this thorn-bush my thorn-bush and this dog my dog

why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon But silence here comes Thisbe



oh


well roared Lion

well run Thisbe

well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a good grace


well moused Lion

and then came Pyramus

and so the lion vanished


sweet moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams
for by thy gracious golden glittering streams
I trust to taste of truest Thisby's sight

but stay O spite
but mark poor knight
what dreadful dole is here
eyes do you see
how can it be
O dainty duck O dear
thy mantle good
what stain'd with blood
approach ye Furies fell
O Fates come come
cut thread and thrum
quail crush conclude and quell


this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad


O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame
since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear
which is no no which was the fairest dame
that liv'd that lov'd that lik'd that look'd with cheer


come tears confound
out sword and wound
the pap of Pyramus
ay that left pap
where heart doth hop
thus die I thus thus thus

now am I dead
now am I fled
my soul is in the sky
tongue lose thy light
moon take thy flight
now die die die die die

no die but an ace for him for he is but one

less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing

with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass

how chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover

she will find him by starlight Here she comes and her passion ends the play


methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus I hope she will be brief

a mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisbe is the better he for a man God warrant us she for a woman God bless us

she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes



asleep my love
what dead my dove
O Pyramus arise
speak speak Quite dumb
dead dead A tomb
must cover thy sweet eyes
these lily lips
this cherry nose
these yellow cowslip cheeks
are gone are gone
lovers make moan
his eyes were green as leeks
O Sisters Three
come come to me
with hands as pale as milk
lay them in gore
since you have shore
tongue not a word
come trusty sword
come blade my breast imbrue

and farewell friends
thus Thisby ends
adieu adieu adieu

moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead

ay and Wall too

no I assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers Will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company

no epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse Never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged But come your Bergomask let your epilogue alone

the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
lovers to bed tis almost fairy time
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd
the heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed
a fortnight hold we this solemnity
in nightly revels and new jollity

now the hungry lion roars
and the wolf behowls the moon
whilst the heavy ploughman snores
all with weary task fordone
now the wasted brands do glow
whilst the screech-owl screeching loud
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance of a shroud
now it is the time of night
that the graves all gaping wide
every one lets forth his sprite
in the church-way paths to glide
and we fairies that do run
by the triple Hecate's team
following darkness like a dream
now are frolic not a mouse
shall disturb this hallow'd house
I am sent with broom before
to sweep the dust behind the door


through the house give glimmering light
by the dead and drowsy fire
every elf and fairy sprite
hop as light as bird from brier
and this ditty after me
sing and dance it trippingly

first rehearse your song by rote
to each word a warbling note
hand in hand with fairy grace
will we sing and bless this place

now until the break of day
through this house each fairy stray
to the best bride-bed will we
which by us shall blessed be
and the issue there create
ever shall be fortunate
so shall all the couples three
ever true in loving be
and the blots of Nature's hand
shall not in their issue stand
never mole hare-lip nor scar
nor mark prodigious such as are
despised in nativity
shall upon their children be
with this field-dew consecrate
every fairy take his gait
and each several chamber bless
through this palace with sweet peace
ever shall in safety rest
trip away
make no stay
meet me all by break of day


if we shadows have offended
think but this and all is mended
that you have but slumber'd here
while these visions did appear
and this weak and idle theme
no more yielding but a dream
gentles do not reprehend
if you pardon we will mend
and as I'm an honest Puck
if we have unearned luck
now to scape the serpent's tongue
we will make amends ere long
else the Puck a liar call
so good night unto you all
and Robin shall restore amends

ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL

in delivering my son from me I bury a second husband

and I in going madam weep o'er my father's death anew but I must attend his majesty's command to whom I am now in ward evermore in subjection

you shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a father He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance

what hope is there of his majesty's amendment

he hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time

this young gentlewoman had a father O that had how sad a passage tis whose skill was almost as great as his honesty had it stretched so far would have made nature immortal and death should have play for lack of work Would for the king's sake he were living I think it would be the death of the king's disease

how called you the man you speak of madam

he was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so Gerard de Narbon
he was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly He was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge could be set up against mortality

what is it my good lord the king languishes of

a fistula my lord

I heard not of it before

I would it were not notorious Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon

his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too in her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness

your commendations madam get from her tears

'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek No more of this Helena go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it

I do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it too

moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the living
if the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it soon mortal

madam I desire your holy wishes

how understand we that

be thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father
in manners as in shape thy blood and virtue
contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
share with thy birthright Love all trust a few
do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
rather in power than use and keep thy friend
under thy own life's key be check'd for silence
but never tax'd for speech What heaven more will
that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
fall on thy head Farewell my lord
'Tis an unseason'd courtier good my lord
advise him

that shall attend his love

heaven bless him Farewell Bertram


the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you Be comfortable to my mother your mistress and make much of her

farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father


O were that all I think not on my father
and these great tears grace his remembrance more
than those I shed for him What was he like
I have forgot him my imagination
carries no favour in't but Bertram's
I am undone there is no living none
if Bertram be away It were all one
that I should love a bright particular star
and think to wed it he is so above me
must I be comforted not in his sphere
the ambition in my love thus plagues itself
the hind that would be mated by the lion
must die for love Twas pretty though a plague
to see him every hour to sit and draw
his arched brows his hawking eye his curls
in our heart's table heart too capable
of every line and trick of his sweet favour
but now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy
must sanctify his reliques Who comes here
one that goes with him I love him for his sake
and yet I know him a notorious liar
think him a great way fool solely a coward
yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
that they take place when virtue's steely bones
look bleak in the cold wind withal full oft we see
cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly



and you monarch

no

and no

are you meditating on virginity

ay You have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question Man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against him

keep him out

but he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak Unfold to us some war-like resistance

there is none man sitting down before you will undermine you and blow you up

bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men


I will stand for't a little though therefore I die a virgin

there's little can be said in't tis against the rule of nature To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience He that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of self-love which is the most inhibited sin in the canon Keep it not you cannot choose but lose by't Out with't within the year it will make itself two which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse Away with't

how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking

let me see marry ill to like him that ne'er it likes Tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth off with't while tis vendible answer the time of request Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek and your virginity your old virginity is like one of our French withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry tis a withered pear it was formerly better marry yet tis a withered pear Will you anything with it

not my virginity yet
there shall your master have a thousand loves
a mother and a mistress and a friend
a ph nix captain and an enemy
a guide a goddess and a sovereign
a counsellor a traitress and a dear
his humble ambition proud humility
his jarring concord and his discord dulcet
his faith his sweet disaster with a world
of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
I know not what he shall God send him well
the court's a learning-place and he is one

what one i' faith

that I wish well Tis pity

what's pity

that wishing well had not a body in't
which might be felt that we the poorer born
whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
might with effects of them follow our friends
and show what we alone must think which never
returns us thanks


Monsieur Parolles my lord calls for you

little Helen farewell if I can remember thee I will think of thee at court

Monsieur Parolles you were born under a charitable star

under Mars I

I especially think under Mars

why under Mars

the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars

when he was predominant

when he was retrograde I think rather

why think you so

you go so much backward when you fight
that's for advantage

so is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and I like the wear well

I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely I will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away farewell When thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends Get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee so farewell


our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky
gives us free scope only doth backward pull
our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
what power is it which mounts my love so high
that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
the mightiest space in fortune nature brings
to join like likes and kiss like native things
impossible be strange attempts to those
that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
what hath been cannot be who ever strove
to show her merit that did miss her love
but my intents are fix'd and will not leave me


the Florentines and Senoys are by the ears
have fought with equal fortune and continue
a braving war

so tis reported sir

nay tis most credible we here receive it
a certainty vouch'd from our cousin Austria
with caution that the Florentine will move us
for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
prejudicates the business and would seem
to have us make denial

his love and wisdom
approv'd so to your majesty may plead
for amplest credence
he hath arm'd our answer
and Florence is denied before he comes
yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
the Tuscan service freely have they leave
to stand on either part

it well may serve
a nursery to our gentry who are sick
for breathing and exploit

what's he comes here


it is the Count Rousillon my good lord
young Betram

youth thou bear'st thy father's face
frank nature rather curious than in haste
hath well compos'd thee Thy father's moral parts

my thanks and duty are your majesty's

I would I had that corporal soundness now
as when thy father and myself in friendship
first tried our soldiership He did look far
into the service of the time and was
discipled of the bravest he lasted long
but on us both did haggish age steal on
and wore us out of act It much repairs me
to talk of your good father In his youth
he had the wit which I can well observe
to-day in our young lords but they may jest
till their own scorn return to them unnoted
ere they can hide their levity in honour
so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
were in his pride or sharpness if they were
his equal had awak'd them and his honour
clock to itself knew the true minute when
his tongue obey'd his hand who were below him
he us'd as creatures of another place
and bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks
making them proud of his humility
in their poor praise he humbled Such a man
might be a copy to these younger times
which follow'd well would demonstrate them now
but goers backward

his good remembrance sir
lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
so in approof lives not his epitaph
as in your royal speech

would I were with him He would always say
methinks I hear him now his plausive words
he scatter'd not in ears but grafted them
to grow there and to bear Let me not live
thus his good melancholy oft began
when it was out Let me not live quoth he
'After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff
of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
all but new things disdain whose judgments are
mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
expire before their fashions This he wish'd
I after him do after him wish too
since I nor wax nor honey can bring home
I quickly were dissolved from my hive
to give some labourers room

you are lov'd sir
they that least lend it you shall lack you first

I fill a place I know't How long is't count
since the physician at your father's died
he was much fam'd

some six months since my lord
if he were living I would try him yet
lend me an arm the rest have worn me out
with several applications nature and sickness
debate it at their leisure Welcome count
my son's no dearer

thank your majesty


I will now hear what say you of this gentlewoman

madam the care I have had to even your content I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings when of ourselves we publish them

what does this knave here Get you gone sirrah the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe tis my slowness that I do not for I know you lack not folly to commit them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours

'Tis not unknown to you madam I am a poor fellow

well sir


wilt thou needs be a beggar

I do beg your good will in this case

in what case

in Isbel's case and mine own Service is no heritage and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body for they say barnes are blessings

tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry

my poor body madam requires it I am driven on by the flesh and he must needs go that the devil drives

is this all your worship's reason

faith madam I have other holy reasons such as they are

may the world know them


thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness

I am out o' friends madam and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake

such friends are thine enemies knave

you're shallow madam in great friends for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of He that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop if I be his cuckold he's my drudge He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses my wife is my friend If men could be contented to be what they are there were no fear in marriage for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion their heads are both one they may joul horns together like any deer i' the herd

wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave

a prophet I madam and I speak the truth the next way

for I the ballad will repeat
which men full true shall find
your marriage comes by destiny
your cuckoo sings by kind



may it please you madam that he bid Helen come to you of her I am to speak

sirrah tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her Helen I mean


was this fair face the cause quoth she
why the Grecians sacked Troy
fond done done fond
was this King Priam's joy
with that she sighed as she stood
with that she sighed as she stood
and gave this sentence then
among nine bad if one be good
among nine bad if one be good
there's yet one good in ten


what one good in ten you corrupt the song sirrah
one good woman in ten madam which is a purifying o' the song Would God would serve the world so all the year we'd find no fault with the tithe-woman if I were the parson One in ten quoth a' An we might have a good woman born but for every blazing star or at an earthquake twould mend the lottery well a man may draw his heart out ere a' pluck one

you'll be gone sir knave and do as I command you

that man should be at woman's command and yet no hurt done Though honesty be no puritan yet it will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart I am going forsooth the business is for Helen to come hither


well now

I know madam you love your gentlewoman entirely

faith I do her father bequeathed her to me and she herself without other advantage may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds there is more owing her than is paid and more shall be paid her than she'll demand

madam I was very late more near her than I think she wished me alone she was and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears she thought I dare vow for her they touched not any stranger sense Her matter was she loved your son Fortune she said was no goddess that had put such difference betwixt their two estates Love no god that would not extend his might only where qualities were level Dian no queen of virgins that would suffer her poor knight surprised without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns you something to know it

you have discharged this honestly keep it to yourself Many likelihoods informed me of this before which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt Pray you leave me stall this in your bosom and I thank you for your honest care I will speak with you further anon

even so it was with me when I was young
if ever we are nature's these are ours this thorn
our blood to us this to our blood is born
it is the show and seal of nature's truth
where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth
by our remembrances of days foregone
such were our faults or then we thought them none

her eye is sick on't I observe her now

what is your pleasure madam

you know Helen
I am a mother to you

mine honourable mistress

nay a mother
why not a mother When I said a mother
methought you saw a serpent what's in mother'
that you start at it I say I am your mother
that were enwombed mine tis often seen
adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
a native slip to us from foreign seeds
you ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan
yet I express to you a mother's care
God's mercy maiden does it curd thy blood
to say I am thy mother What's the matter
that this distemper'd messenger of wet
the many-colour'd Iris rounds thine eye
why that you are my daughter

that I am not

I say I am your mother

pardon madam
the Count Rousillon cannot be my brother
I am from humble he from honour'd name
no note upon my parents his all noble
his servant live and will his vassal die
he must not be my brother

nor I your mother

you are my mother madam would you were
so that my lord your son were not my brother
indeed my mother or were you both our mothers
I care no more for than I do for heaven
so I were not his sister Can't no other
but I your daughter he must be my brother

yes Helen you might be my daughter-in-law
God shield you mean it not daughter and mother
so strive upon your pulse What pale again
my fear hath catch'd your fondness now I see
the mystery of your loneliness and find
your salt tears' head now to all sense tis gross
you love my son invention is asham'd
to say thou dost not therefore tell me true
but tell me then tis so for look thy cheeks
confess it th' one to th' other and thine eyes
see it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
that in their kind they speak it only sin
and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
that truth should be suspected Speak is't so
if it be so you have wound a goodly clew
if it be not forswear't howe'er I charge thee
as heaven shall work in me for thine avail
to tell me truly

good madam pardon me

do you love my son

your pardon noble mistress

love you my son
do not you love him madam

go not about my love hath in't a bond
whereof the world takes note come come disclose
the state of your affection for your passions
have to the full appeach'd

then I confess
here on my knee before high heaven and you
that before you and next unto high heaven
I love your son
my friends were poor but honest so's my love
be not offended for it hurts not him
that he is lov'd of me I follow him not
by any token of presumptuous suit
nor would I have him till I do deserve him
yet never know how that desert should be
I know I love in vain strive against hope
yet in this captious and intenible sieve
and lack not to lose still Thus Indian-like
religious in mine error I adore
the sun that looks upon his worshipper
but knows of him no more My dearest madam
let not your hate encounter with my love
for loving where you do but if yourself
whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
did ever in so true a flame of liking
wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
was both herself and Love O then give pity
to her whose state is such that cannot choose
but lend and give where she is sure to lose
that seeks not to find that her search implies
but riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies

had you not lately an intent speak truly
to go to Paris

madam I had
wherefore tell true

I will tell truth by grace itself I swear
you know my father left me some prescriptions
of rare and prov'd effects such as his reading
and manifest experience had collected
for general sovereignty and that he will'd me
in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them
as notes whose faculties inclusive were
more than they were in note Amongst the rest
there is a remedy approv'd set down
to cure the desperate languishings whereof
the king is render'd lost

this was your motive
for Paris was it speak

my lord your son made me to think of this
else Paris and the medicine and the king
haply been absent then

but think you Helen
if you should tender your supposed aid
he would receive it He and his physicians
are of a mind he that they cannot help him
they that they cannot help How shall they credit
a poor unlearned virgin when the schools
embowell'd of their doctrine have left off
the danger to itself

there's something in't
more than my father's skill which was the great'st
of his profession that his good receipt
shall for my legacy be sanctified
by the luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
but give me leave to try success I'd venture
the well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure
by such a day and hour
dost thou believe't

ay madam knowingly

why Helen thou shalt have my leave and love
means and attendants and my loving greetings
to those of mine in court I'll stay at home
and pray God's blessing into thy attempt
be gone to-morrow and be sure of this
what I can help thee to thou shalt not miss


farewell young lords these war-like principles
do not throw from you and you my lords farewell
share the advice betwixt you if both gain all
the gift doth stretch itself as tis receiv'd
and is enough for both

'Tis our hope sir
and find your Grace in health

no no it cannot be and yet my heart
will not confess he owes the malady
that doth my life besiege Farewell young lords
whether I live or die be you the sons
of worthy Frenchmen let higher Italy
those bated that inherit but the fall
of the last monarchy see that you come
not to woo honour but to wed it when
the bravest questant shrinks find what you seek
that fame may cry you loud I say farewell

health at your bidding serve your majesty

those girls of Italy take heed of them
they say our French lack language to deny
if they demand beware of being captives
before you serve
our hearts receive your warnings

farewell Come hither to me


O my sweet lord that you will stay behind us

'Tis not his fault the spark

O tis brave wars

most admirable I have seen those wars

I am commanded here and kept a coil with
'Too young and the next year and tis too early

an thy mind stand to't boy steal away bravely

I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock
till honour be bought up and no sword worn
but one to dance with By heaven I'll steal away

there's honour in the theft

commit it count

I am your accessary and so farewell

I grow to you and our parting is a tortured body

farewell captain

sweet Monsieur Parolles

noble heroes my sword and yours are kin Good sparks and lustrous a word good metals you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio with his cicatrice an emblem of war here on his sinister cheek it was this very sword entrenched it say to him I live and observe his reports for me

we shall noble captain

Mars dote on you for his novices What will ye do

stay the king


use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu be more expressive to them for they wear themselves in the cap of the time there do muster true gait eat speak and move under the influence of the most received star and though the devil lead the measure such are to be followed After them and take a more dilated farewell

and I will do so

worthy fellows and like to prove most sinewy swordmen

pardon my lord for me and for my tidings

I'll fee thee to stand up

then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon
I would you had kneel'd my lord to ask me mercy
and that at my bidding you could so stand up

and ask'd thee mercy for't

good faith across but my good lord tis thus
will you be cur'd of your infirmity

no

O will you eat no grapes my royal fox
yes but you will my noble grapes an if
my royal fox could reach them I have seen a medicine
that's able to breathe life into a stone
quicken a rock and make you dance canary
with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
is powerful to araise King Pepin nay
to give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
and write to her a love-line

what her' is this

if you will see her now by my faith and honour
if seriously I may convey my thoughts
in this my light deliverance I have spoke
with one that in her sex her years profession
wisdom and constancy hath amaz'd me more
than I dare blame my weakness Will you see her
for that is her demand and know her business
that done laugh well at me

now good Lafeu
bring in the admiration that we with thee
may spend our wonder too or take off thine
by wond'ring how thou took'st it

nay I'll fit you
and not be all day neither


thus he his special nothing ever prologues

nay come your ways

this haste hath wings indeed

nay come your ways
this is his majesty say your mind to him
a traitor you do look like but such traitors
his majesty seldom fears I am Cressid's uncle
that dare leave two together Fare you well


now fair one does your business follow us

ay my good lord
Gerard de Narbon was my father
in what he did profess well found

I knew him
the rather will I spare my praises towards him
knowing him is enough On's bed of death
many receipts he gave me chiefly one
which as the dearest issue of his practice
and of his old experience the only darling
he bade me store up as a triple eye
safer than mine own two more dear I have so
and hearing your high majesty is touch'd
with that malignant cause wherein the honour
of my dear father's gift stands chief in power
I come to tender it and my appliance
with all bound humbleness

we thank you maiden
but may not be so credulous of cure
when our most learned doctors leave us and
the congregated college have concluded
that labouring art can never ransom nature
from her inaidable estate I say we must not
to prostitute our past-cure malady
to empirics or to dissever so
our great self and our credit to esteem
a senseless help when help past sense we deem

my duty then shall pay me for my pains
I will no more enforce mine office on you
humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
a modest one to bear me back again

I cannot give thee less to be call'd grateful
thou thought'st to help me and such thanks I give
as one near death to those that wish him live
but what at full I know thou know'st no part
I knowing all my peril thou no art

what I can do can do no hurt to try
since you set up your rest gainst remedy
he that of greatest works is finisher
so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
when judges have been babes great floods have flown
from simple sources and great seas have dried
when miracles have by the greatest been denied
oft expectation fails and most oft there
where most it promises and oft it hits
where hope is coldest and despair most fits

I must not hear thee fare thee well kind maid
thy pains not us'd must by thyself be paid
proffers not took reap thanks for their reward

inspired merit so by breath is barr'd
it is not so with Him that all things knows
as tis with us that square our guess by shows
but most it is presumption in us when
the help of heaven we count the act of men
dear sir to my endeavours give consent
of heaven not me make an experiment
myself against the level of mine aim
but know I think and think I know most sure
my art is not past power nor you past cure

art thou so confident Within what space
hop'st thou my cure

the great'st grace lending grace
ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
ere twice in murk and occidental damp
moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp
or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
health shall live free and sickness freely die

upon thy certainty and confidence
what dar'st thou venture
tax of impudence
a strumpet's boldness a divulged shame
traduc'd by odious ballads my maiden's name
sear'd otherwise nay worse if worse extended
with vilest torture let my life be ended

methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
his powerful sound within an organ weak
and what impossibility would slay
in common sense sense saves another way
thy life is dear for all that life can rate
worth name of life in thee hath estimate
youth beauty wisdom courage virtue all
that happiness and prime can happy call
thou this to hazard needs must intimate
skill infinite or monstrous desperate
sweet practiser thy physic I will try
that ministers thine own death if I die

of what I spoke unpitied let me die
and well deserv'd Not helping death's my fee
but if I help what do you promise me

make thy demand

but will you make it even

ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven

then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
what husband in thy power I will command
exempted be from me the arrogance
to choose from forth the royal blood of France
my low and humble name to propagate
with any branch or image of thy state
but such a one thy vassal whom I know
is free for me to ask thee to bestow

thy will by my performance shall be serv'd
so make the choice of thy own time for I
thy resolv'd patient on thee still rely
more should I question thee and more I must
though more to know could not be more to trust
from whence thou cam'st how tended on but rest
unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest
give me some help here ho If thou proceed
as high as word my deed shall match thy deed


come on sir I shall now put you to the height of your breeding

I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught I know my business is but to the court

to the court why what place make you special when you put off that with such contempt But to the court

truly madam if God have lent a man any manners he may easily put it off at court he that cannot make a leg put off's cap kiss his hand and say nothing has neither leg hands lip nor cap and indeed such a fellow to say precisely were not for the court But for me I have an answer will serve all men


it is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks the pin-buttock the quatch-buttock the brawn-buttock or any buttock

will your answer serve fit to all questions

as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney as your French crown for your taffeta punk as Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday a morris for Mayday as the nail to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin

have you I say an answer of such fitness for all questions

from below your duke to beneath your constable it will fit any question

it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands

but a trifle neither in good faith if the learned should speak truth of it Here it is and all that belongs to't ask me if I am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learn

to be young again if we could I will be a fool in question hoping to be the wiser by your answer I pray you sir are you a courtier

O Lord sir there's a simple putting off More more a hundred of them


O Lord sir Thick thick spare not me

I think sir you can eat none of this homely meat

O Lord sir Nay put me to't I warrant you

you were lately whipped sir as I think

O Lord sir Spare not me

do you cry O Lord sir at your whipping and Spare not me Indeed your O Lord sir is very sequent to your whipping you would answer very well to a whipping if you were but bound to't

I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my O Lord sir I see things may serve long but not serve ever

I play the noble housewife with the time
to entertain't so merrily with a fool

O Lord sir why there't serves well again
an end sir to your business Give Helen this
and urge her to a present answer back
commend me to my kinsmen and my son
this is not much

not much commendation to them

not much employment for you you understand me

most fruitfully I am there before my legs

haste you again


they say miracles are past and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear

why tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times

and so tis
to be relinquished of the artists

so I say

both of Galen and Paracelsus

so I say

of all the learned and authentic fellows

right so I say

that gave him out incurable

why there tis so say I too

not to be helped

right as twere a man assured of a
uncertain life and sure death

just you say well so would I have said

I may truly say it is a novelty to the world

it is indeed if you will have it in showing you shall read it in what do you call there

a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor

that's it I would have said the very same

why your dolphin is not lustier fore me I speak in respect

nay tis strange tis very strange that is the brief and the tedious of it and he is of a most facinorous spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the

very hand of heaven

ay so I say
in a most weak and debile minister great power great transcendence which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king as to be generally thankful

I would have said it you say well Here comes the king


lustig as the Dutchman says I'll like a maid the better whilst I have a tooth in my head Why he's able to lead her a coranto

mort du vinaigre Is not this Helen

'Fore God I think so

go call before me all the lords in court

sit my preserver by thy patient's side
and with this healthful hand whose banish'd sense
thou hast repeal'd a second time receive
the confirmation of my promised gift
which but attends thy naming

fair maid send forth thine eye this youthful parcel
of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing
o'er whom both sov'reign power and father's voice
I have to use thy frank election make

thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake

to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
fall when Love please marry to each but one

I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
my mouth no more were broken than these boys'
and writ as little beard

peruse them well
not one of those but had a noble father

gentlemen
heaven hath through me restor'd the king to health
we understand it and thank heaven for you

I am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
that I protest I simply am a maid
please it your majesty I have done already
the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
'We blush that thou shouldst choose but be refus'd
let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
we'll ne'er come there again

make choice and see
who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me

now Dian from thy altar do I fly
and to imperial Love that god most high
do my sighs stream Sir will you hear my suit

and grant it


I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life

the honour sir that flames in your fair eyes
before I speak too threateningly replies
love make your fortunes twenty times above
her that so wishes and her humble love

no better if you please

my wish receive
which great Love grant and so I take my leave

do all they deny her An they were sons of mine I'd have them whipp'd or I would send them to the Turk to make eunuchs of

be not afraid that I your hand should take
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake
blessing upon your vows and in your bed
find fairer fortune if you ever wed
these boys are boys of ice they'll none have her sure they are bastards to the English the French ne'er got em

you are too young too happy and too good
to make yourself a son out of my blood

fair one I think not so

there's one grape yet I am sure thy father drunk wine But if thou be'st not an ass I am a youth of fourteen I have known thee already

I dare not say I take you but I give
me and my service ever whilst I live
into your guiding power This is the man

why then young Bertram take her she's thy wife

my wife my liege I shall beseech your highness
in such a business give me leave to use
the help of mine own eyes

what she has done for me

yes my good lord
but never hope to know why I should marry her

thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed

but follows it my lord to bring me down
must answer for your raising I know her well
she had her breeding at my father's charge
a poor physician's daughter my wife Disdain
rather corrupt me ever

'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which
I can build up Strange is it that our bloods
of colour weight and heat pour'd all together
would quite confound distinction yet stand off
in differences so mighty If she be
all that is virtuous save what thou dislik'st
of virtue for the name but do not so
from lowest place when virtuous things proceed
the place is dignified by the doer's deed
where great additions swell's and virtue none
it is a dropsied honour Good alone
is good without a name vileness is so
the property by what it is should go
not by the title She is young wise fair
in these to nature she's immediate heir
and these breed honour that is honour's scorn
which challenges itself as honour's born
and is not like the sire honours thrive
when rather from our acts we them derive
than our foregoers The mere word's a slave
debosh'd on every tomb on every grave
a lying trophy and as oft is dumb
where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
of honour'd bones indeed What should be said
if thou canst like this creature as a maid
is her own dower honour and wealth from me

I cannot love her nor will strive to do't

thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose

that you are well restor'd my lord I'm glad
let the rest go

my honour's at the stake which to defeat
I must produce my power Here take her hand
proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
that dost in vile misprision shackle up
my love and her desert thou canst not dream
we poising us in her defective scale
shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
it is in us to plant thine honour where
we please to have it grow Check thy contempt
obey our will which travails in thy good
do thine own fortunes that obedient right
which both thy duty owes and our power claims
or I will throw thee from my care for ever
into the staggers and the careless lapse
of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
loosing upon thee in the name of justice
without all terms of pity Speak thine answer

pardon my gracious lord for I submit
my fancy to your eyes When I consider
what great creation and what dole of honour
flies where you bid it I find that she which late
was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
the praised of the king who so ennobled
is as twere born so

take her by the hand
and tell her she is thine to whom I promise
a counterpoise if not to thy estate

I take her hand

good fortune and the favour of the king
smile upon this contract whose ceremony
shall seem expedient on the now-born brief
and be perform'd to-night the solemn feast
shall more attend upon the coming space
expecting absent friends As thou lov'st her
thy love's to me religious else does err


do you hear monsieur a word with you

your pleasure sir

your lord and master did well to make his recantation

recantation My lord my master
ay is it not a language I speak

a most harsh one and not to be understood without bloody succeeding My master

are you companion to the Count Rousillon

to any count to all counts to what is man

to what is count's man count's master is of another style

you are too old sir let it satisfy you you are too old

I must tell thee sirrah I write man to which title age cannot bring thee

what I dare too well do I dare not do

I did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty wise fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel it might pass yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden I have now found thee when I lose thee again I care not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up and that thou'rt scarce worth

hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee
do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou hasten thy trial which if Lord have mercy on thee for a hen So my good window of lattice fare thee well thy casement I need not open for I look through thee Give me thy hand

my lord you give me most egregious indignity

ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it

I have not my lord deserved it

yes good faith every dram of it and I will not bate thee a scruple

well I shall be wiser

e'en as soon as thou canst for thou hast to pull at a smack o' the contrary If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee or rather my knowledge that I may say in the default he is a man I know

my lord you do me most insupportable vexation

I would it were hell-pains for thy sake and my poor doing eternal for doing I am past as I will by thee in what motion age will give me leave




sirrah your lord and master's married there's news for you you have a new mistress

I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs he is my good lord whom I serve above is my master

who God

ay sir

the devil it is that's thy master Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion dost make hose of thy sleeves do other servants so Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands By mine honour if I were but two hours younger I'd beat thee methinks thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee

this is hard and undeserved measure my lord

go to sir you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate you are a vagabond and no true traveller you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the heraldry of your birth and virtue gives you commission You are not worth another word else I'd call you knave I leave you


good very good it is so then good very good Let it be concealed awhile

undone and forfeited to cares for ever

what is the matter sweet heart

although before the solemn priest I have sworn
I will not bed her

what what sweet heart

O my Parolles they have married me
I'll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her

France is a dog-hole and it no more merits
the tread of a man's foot To the wars

there's letters from my mother what the import is
I know not yet

ay that would be known To the wars my boy to the wars
that hugs his kicky-wicky here at home
spending his manly marrow in her arms
which should sustain the bound and high curvet
of Mars's fiery steed To other regions
France is a stable we that dwell in't jades
therefore to the war

it shall be so I'll send her to my house
acquaint my mother with my hate to her
and wherefore I am fled write to the king
that which I durst not speak his present gift
shall furnish me to those Italian fields
where noble fellows strike War is no strife
to the dark house and the detested wife

will this capriccio hold in thee art sure

go with me to my chamber and advise me
I'll send her straight away to-morrow

why these balls bound there's noise in it Tis hard
a young man married is a man that's marr'd
therefore away and leave her bravely go
the king has done you wrong but hush tis so


my mother greets me kindly is she well

she is not well but yet she has her health she's very merry but yet she is not well but thanks be given she's very well and wants nothing i' the world but yet she is not well

if she be very well what does she ail that she's not very well

truly she's very well indeed but for two things

what two things

one that she's not in heaven whither
God send her quickly the other that she's in earth from whence God send her quickly

bless you my fortunate lady

I hope sir I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes

you had my prayers to lead them on and to keep them on have them still O my knave how does my old lady

so that you had her wrinkles and I her money I would she did as you say

why I say nothing

marry you are the wiser man for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing To say nothing to do nothing to know nothing and to have nothing is to be a great part of your title which is within a very little of nothing

away thou'rt a knave

you should have said sir before a knave thou'rt a knave that is before me thou'rt a knave this had been truth sir

go to thou art a witty fool I have found thee


a good knave i' faith and well fed
madam my lord will go away to-night
a very serious business calls on him
the great prerogative and rite of love
which as your due time claims he does acknowledge
but puts it off to a compell'd restraint
whose want and whose delay is strew'd with sweets
which they distil now in the curbed time
to make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
and pleasure drown the brim

what's his will else

that you will take your instant leave o' the king
and make this haste as your own good proceeding
strengthen'd with what apology you think
may make it probable need


that having this obtain'd you presently
attend his further pleasure

in everything I wait upon his will

I shall report it so

I pray you Come sirrah


but I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier

yes my lord and of very valiant approof

you have it from his own deliverance

and by other warranted testimony


I do assure you my lord he is very great in knowledge and accordingly valiant

I have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour and my state that way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent Here he comes I pray you make us friends I will pursue the amity


these things shall be done sir

pray you sir who's his tailor

sir

O I know him well Ay sir he sir is a good workman a very good tailor

is she gone to the king

she is

will she away to-night
as you'll have her

I have writ my letters casketed my treasure
given orders for our horses and to-night
when I should take possession of the bride
end ere I do begin

a good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner but one that lies three thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with should be once heard and thrice beaten God save you captain

is there any unkindness between my lord and you monsieur

I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure

you have made shift to run into't boots and spurs and all like him that leaped into the custard and out of it you'll run again rather than suffer question for your residence

it may be you have mistaken him my lord

and shall do so ever though I took him at his prayers Fare you well my lord and believe this of me there can be no kernel in this light nut the soul of this man is his clothes Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence I have kept of them tame and know their natures Farewell monsieur I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand but we must do good against evil

an idle lord I swear

I think not so

why do you not know him

yes I do know him well and common speech
gives him a worthy pass Here comes my clog


I have sir as I was commanded from you
spoke with the king and have procur'd his leave
for present parting only he desires
some private speech with you

I shall obey his will
you must not marvel Helen at my course
which holds not colour with the time nor does
the ministration and required office
for such a business therefore am I found
so much unsettled This drives me to entreat you
that presently you take your way for home
and rather muse than ask why I entreat you
for my respects are better than they seem
and my appointments have in them a need
greater than shows itself at the first view
to you that know them not This to my mother

'Twill be two days ere I shall see you so
I leave you to your wisdom

sir I can nothing say
but that I am your most obedient servant

come come no more of that

and ever shall
with true observance seek to eke out that
to equal my great fortune

let that go
my haste is very great Farewell hie home

pray sir your pardon

well what would you say

I am not worthy of the wealth I owe
nor dare I say tis mine and yet it is
but like a timorous thief most fain would steal
what law does vouch mine own

what would you have

something and scarce so much nothing indeed
I would not tell you what I would my lord
faith yes

I pray you stay not but in haste to horse

I shall not break your bidding good my lord

farewell

go thou toward home where I will never come
whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum
away and for our flight

bravely coragio

so that from point to point now have you heard
the fundamental reasons of this war
whose great decision hath much blood let forth
and more thirsts after

holy seems the quarrel
on the opposer

therefore we marvel much our cousin France
would in so just a business shut his bosom
against our borrowing prayers

good my lord
the reasons of our state I cannot yield
but like a common and an outward man
that the great figure of a council frames
by self-unable motion therefore dare not
say what I think of it since I have found
myself in my incertain grounds to fail
as often as I guess'd

be it his pleasure

but I am sure the younger of our nature
that surfeit on their ease will day by day

welcome shall they be
and all the honours that can fly from us
shall on them settle You know your places well
when better fall for your avails they fell
to-morrow to the field


it hath happened all as I would have had it save that he comes not along with her

by my troth I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man

by what observance I pray you

why he will look upon his boot and sing mend the ruff and sing ask questions and sing pick his teeth and sing I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song

let me see what he writes and when he means to come

I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court Our old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court the brains of my Cupid's knocked out and I begin to love as an old man loves money with no stomach
what have we here

e'en that you have there


I have sent you a daughter-in-law she hath recovered the king and undone me I have wedded her not bedded her and sworn to make the not' eternal You shall hear I am ran away know it before the report come If there be breadth enough in the world I will hold a long distance My duty to you
your unfortunate son
this is not well rash and unbridled boy
to fly the favours of so good a king
to pluck his indignation on thy head
by the misprising of a maid too virtuous
for the contempt of empire


O madam yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady

what is the matter

nay there is some comfort in the news some comfort your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would
why should he be killed

so say I madam if he run away as I hear he does the danger is in standing to't that's the loss of men though it be the getting of children Here they come will tell you more for my part I only hear your son was run away

save you good madam

madam my lord is gone for ever gone

do not say so

think upon patience Pray you gentlemen
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
that the first face of neither on the start
can woman me unto t where is my son I pray you

madam he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence
we met him thitherward for thence we came
and after some dispatch in hand at court
thither we bend again
look on his letter madam here's my passport
when thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to then call me husband but in such a then' I write a never
this is a dreadful sentence

brought you this letter gentlemen

ay madam
and for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains

I prithee lady have a better cheer
if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine
thou robb'st me of a moiety he was my son
but I do wash his name out of my blood
and thou art all my child Towards Florence is he

ay madam

and to be a soldier

the duke will lay upon him all the honour
that good convenience claims

return you thither

ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed

till I have no wife I have nothing in France
'Tis bitter

find you that there

ay madam

'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his heart was not consenting to

nothing in France until he have no wife
there's nothing here that is too good for him
but only she and she deserves a lord
and call her hourly mistress Who was with him

a servant only and a gentleman
which I have some time known

Parolles was it not

ay my good lady he

a very tainted fellow and full of wickedness
my son corrupts a well-derived nature
with his inducement

indeed good lady
the fellow has a deal of that too much
which holds him much to have

y'are welcome gentlemen
I will entreat you when you see my son
the honour that he loses more I'll entreat you
written to bear along

we serve you madam
in that and all your worthiest affairs

not so but as we change our courtesies
will you draw near


'Till I have no wife I have nothing in France
nothing in France until he has no wife
thou shalt have none Rousillon none in France
then hast thou all again Poor lord is't I
that chase thee from thy country and expose
those tender limbs of thine to the event
of the non-sparing war and is it I
that drive thee from the sportive court where thou
wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark
that ride upon the violent speed of fire
fly with false aim move the still-piecing air
that sings with piercing do not touch my lord
whoever shoots at him I set him there
whoever charges on his forward breast
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't
and though I kill him not I am the cause
his death was so effected better twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
with sharp constraint of hunger better twere
that all the miseries which nature owes
were mine at once No come thou home Rousillon
whence honour but of danger wins a scar
as oft it loses all I will be gone
my being here it is that holds thee hence
shall I stay here to do't no no although
the air of paradise did fan the house
and angels offic'd all I will be gone
that pitiful rumour may report my flight
for with the dark poor thief I'll steal away


the general of our horse thou art and we
great in our hope lay our best love and credence
upon thy promising fortune

sir it is
a charge too heavy for my strength but yet
we'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
to the extreme edge of hazard

then go thou forth
and fortune play upon thy prosp'rous helm
as thy auspicious mistress

this very day
great Mars I put myself into thy file
make me but like my thoughts and I shall prove


alas and would you take the letter of her
might you not know she would do as she has done
by sending me a letter Read it again

I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim thither gone

ambitious love hath so in me offended
that bare-foot plod I the cold ground upon
with sainted vow my faults to have amended
write write that from the bloody course of war
my dearest master your dear son may hie
bless him at home in peace whilst I from far
his name with zealous fervour sanctify
his taken labours bid him me forgive
I his despiteful Juno sent him forth
from courtly friends with camping foes to live
where death and danger dog the heels of worth
whom I myself embrace to set him free


Ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words
Rinaldo you did never lack advice so much
as letting her pass so had I spoke with her
I could have well diverted her intents
which thus she hath prevented

pardon me madam
if I had given you this at over-night
she might have been o'erta'en and yet she writes
pursuit would be but vain

what angel shall
bless this unworthy husband he cannot thrive
unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear
and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath
of greatest justice Write write Rinaldo
let every word weigh heavy of her worth
that he does weigh too light my greatest grief
though little he do feel it set down sharply
dispatch the most convenient messenger
when haply he shall hear that she is gone
he will return and hope I may that she
hearing so much will speed her foot again
led hither by pure love Which of them both
is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
to make distinction Provide this messenger
my heart is heavy and mine age is weak
grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak


nay come for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight

they say the French Count has done most honourable service

it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother We have lost our labour they are gone a contrary way hark you may know by their trumpets
come let's return again and suffice ourselves with the report of it Well Diana take heed of this French earl the honour of a maid is her name and no legacy is so rich as honesty

I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion

I know that knave hang him one Parolles a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl Beware of them Diana their promises enticements oaths tokens and all these engines of lust are not the things they go under many a maid hath been seduced by them and the misery is example that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade succession but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them I hope I need not to advise you further but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost

you shall not need to fear me

I hope so Look here comes a pilgrim
I know she will lie at my house thither they send one another I'll question her

God save you pilgrim whither are you bound

to Saint Jaques le Grand
where do the palmers lodge I do beseech you

at the Saint Francis here beside the port

is this the way
ay marry is't Hark you

they come this way If you will tarry holy pilgrim
but till the troops come by
I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd
the rather for I think I know your hostess
as ample as myself

is it yourself

if you shall please so pilgrim

I thank you and will stay upon your leisure

you came I think from France

I did so

here you shall see a countryman of yours

his name I pray you

the Count Rousillon know you such a one

but by the ear that hears most nobly of him
his face I know not

whatsoe'er he is
he's bravely taken here He stole from France
as tis reported for the king had married him
against his liking Think you it is so

ay surely mere the truth I know his lady

there is a gentleman that serves the count
reports but coarsely of her

what's his name
Monsieur Parolles

O I believe with him
in argument of praise or to the worth
of the great count himself she is too mean
to have her name repeated all her deserving
is a reserved honesty and that
I have not heard examin'd

alas poor lady
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
of a detesting lord

ay right good creature wheresoe'er she is
her heart weighs sadly This young maid might do her
a shrewd turn if she pleas'd

how do you mean
may be the amorous count solicits her

he does indeed
and brokes with all that can in such a suit
corrupt the tender honour of a maid
but she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
in honestest defence

the gods forbid else


so now they come
that is Antonio the duke's eldest son
that Escalus

which is the Frenchman

he
that with the plume tis a most gallant fellow
I would he lov'd his wife If he were honester

I like him well

'Tis pity he is not honest Yond's that same knave
that leads him to these places were I his lady
I would poison that vile rascal

which is he

that jack-an-apes with scarfs Why is he melancholy

perchance he's hurt i' the battle

lose our drum well

he's shrewdly vexed at something
look he has spied us

marry hang you
and your courtesy for a ring-carrier


the troop is past Come pilgrim I will bring you
where you shall host of enjoin'd penitents
there's four or five to great Saint Jaques bound
already at my house

I humbly thank you
please it this matron and this gentle maid
to eat with us to-night the charge and thanking
shall be for me and to requite you further
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
worthy the note

we'll take your offer kindly


nay good my lord put him to't let him have his way
if your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no more in your respect

on my life my lord a bubble

do you think I am so far deceived in him

believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he's a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promise-breaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment

it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you

I would I knew in what particular action to try him

none better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to do

I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy We will bind and hood wink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents Be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anything

O for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem for't When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not John Drum's entertainment your inclining cannot be removed Here he comes

O for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand

how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your disposition

a pox on't let it go tis but a drum

'But a drum Is't but a drum A drum so lost There was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers

that was not to be blamed in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that C sar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command

well we cannot greatly condemn our success some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recovered

it might have been recovered

it might but it is not now

it is to be recovered But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer I would have that drum or another or hic jacet

why if you have a stomach to't monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness


but you must not now slumber in it

I'll about it this evening and I will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from me

may I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it

I know not what the success will be my lord but the attempt I vow

I know thou'rt valiant and to the possibility of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee Farewell

I love not many words


no more than a fish loves water Is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do't

you do not know him my lord as we do certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever after

why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto
none in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies But we have almost embossed him you shall see his fall to-night for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect

we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him He was first smoked by the old Lord Lafeu when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you shall see this very night

I must go look my twigs he shall be caught

your brother he shall go along with me

as't please your lordship I'll leave you


now will I lead you to the house and show you
the lass I spoke of

but you say she's honest

that's all the fault I spoke with her but once
and found her wondrous cold but I sent to her
by this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind
and this is all I have done She's a fair creature
will you go see her

with all my heart my lord


if you misdoubt me that I am not she
I know not how I shall assure you further
but I shall lose the grounds I work upon

though my estate be fall'n I was well born
nothing acquainted with these businesses
and would not put my reputation now
in any staining act

nor would I wish you
first give me trust the county is my husband
and what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
is so from word to word and then you cannot
err in bestowing it

I should believe you
for you have show'd me that which well approves
you're great in fortune

take this purse of gold
and let me buy your friendly help thus far
which I will over-pay and pay again
when I have found it The county woos your daughter
lays down his wanton siege before her beauty
resolv'd to carry her let her in fine consent
as we'll direct her how tis best to bear it
now his important blood will nought deny
that she'll demand a ring the county wears
that down ward hath succeeded in his house
from son to son some four or five descents
since the first father wore it this ring he holds
in most rich choice yet in his idle fire
howe'er repented after

now I see
the bottom of your purpose

you see it lawful then It is no more
but that your daughter ere she seems as won
desires this ring appoints him an encounter
in fine delivers me to fill the time
herself most chastely absent After this
to marry her I'll add three thousand crowns
to what is past already

I have yielded
instruct my daughter how she shall persever
that time and place with this deceit so lawful
may prove coherent Every night he comes
with musics of all sorts and songs compos'd
to her unworthiness it nothing steads us
as if his life lay on't

why then to-night
let us assay our plot which if it speed
is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
and lawful meaning in a lawful act
where both not sin and yet a sinful fact
but let's about it

he can come no other way but by this hedge-corner When you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must not seem to understand him unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter

good captain let me be the interpreter

art not acquainted with him knows he not thy voice

no sir I warrant you

but what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again


he must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we seem to know is to know straight our purpose chough's language gabble enough and good enough As for you interpreter you must seem very politic But couch ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges


ten o'clock within these three hours twill be time enough to go home What shall I say I have done It must be a very plausive invention that carries it They begin to smoke me and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door I find my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures not daring the reports of my tongue

this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of

what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the impossibility and knowing I had no such purpose I must give myself some hurts and say I got them in exploit Yet slight ones will not carry it they will say Came you off with so little and great ones I dare not give Wherefore what's the instance Tongue I must put you into a butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of Bajazet's mute if you prattle me into these perils

is it possible he should know what he is and be that he is

I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my Spanish sword

we cannot afford you so

or the baring of my beard and to say it was in stratagem

'Twould not do
or to drown my clothes and say I was stripped

hardly serve

though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel

how deep

thirty fathom

three great oaths would scarce make that be believed

I would I had any drum of the enemy's
I would swear I recovered it

thou shalt hear one anon

a drum now of the enemy's

go tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
we have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled
till we do hear from them

captain I will

a' will betray us all unto ourselves
inform on that

so I will sir

till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd

they told me that your name was Fontibell

no my good lord Diana

titled goddess
and worth it with addition But fair soul
in your fine frame hath love no quality
if the quick fire of youth light not your mind
you are no maiden but a monument
when you are dead you should be such a one
as you are now for you are cold and stern
and now you should be as your mother was
when your sweet self was got

she then was honest

so should you be

my mother did but duty such my lord
as you owe to your wife

no more o' that
I prithee do not strive against my vows
I was compell'd to her but I love thee
by love's own sweet constraint and will for ever
do thee all rights of service

ay so you serve us
till we serve you but when you have our roses
you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
and mock us with our bareness

how have I sworn

'Tis not the many oaths that make the truth
but the plain single vow that is vow'd true
what is not holy that we swear not by
if I should swear by God's great attributes
I lov'd you dearly would you believe my oaths
when I did love you ill this has no holding
to swear by him whom I protest to love
that I will work against him therefore your oaths
are words and poor conditions but unseal'd
at least in my opinion

change it change it
be not so holy-cruel love is holy
and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
that you do charge men with Stand no more off
but give thyself unto my sick desires
who then recover say thou art mine and ever
my love as it begins shall so persever

I see that men make ropes in such a scarr
that we'll forsake ourselves Give me that ring

to give it from me

will you not my lord

it is an honour longing to our house
bequeathed down from many ancestors
which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
in me to lose

mine honour's such a ring
my chastity's the jewel of our house
bequeathed down from many ancestors
which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
in me to lose Thus your own proper wisdom
brings in the champion honour on my part
against your vain assault

here take my ring
my house mine honour yea my life be thine

when midnight comes knock at my chamber-window
I'll order take my mother shall not hear
now will I charge you in the band of truth
when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed
remain there but an hour nor speak to me
my reasons are most strong and you shall know them
when back again this ring shall be deliver'd
and on your finger in the night I'll put
another ring that what in time proceeds
may token to the future our past deeds
adieu till then then fail not You have won
a wife of me though there my hope be done

a heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee


for which live long to thank both heaven and me
you may so in the end
as if she sat in s heart she says all men
have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me
when his wife's dead therefore I'll lie with him
when I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid
marry that will I live and die a maid
only in this disguise I think't no sin
to cozen him that would unjustly win


you have not given him his mother's letter

I have delivered it an hour since there is something in't that stings his nature for on the reading it he changed almost into another man

he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady

especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him I will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you

when you have spoken it tis dead and I am the grave of it


now God delay our rebellion as we are ourselves what things are we

merely our own traitors and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself

is it not most damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents We shall not then have his company to-night

not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour

that approaches apace I would gladly have him see his company anatomized that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit

we will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the other

in the meantime what near you of these wars

I hear there is an overture of peace

nay I assure you a peace concluded


I perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his council

let it be forbid sir so should I be a great deal of his act

sir his wife some two months since fled from his house her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heaven

how is this justified

the stronger part of it by her own letters which make her story true even to the point of her death her death itself which could not be her office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place

hath the count all this intelligence

ay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verity

I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this

how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses


the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues

how now where's your master

he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken a solemn leave his lordship will next morning for France The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king

they shall be no more than needful there if they were more than they can commend

they cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness Here's his lordship now

how now my lord is't not after midnight

I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses a month's length a-piece by an abstract of success I have conge'd with the duke done my adieu with his nearest buried a wife mourned for her writ to my lady mother I am returning entertained my convoy and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs the last was the greatest but that I have not ended yet

if the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence it requires haste of your lordship

I mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it hereafter But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier Come bring forth this counterfeit model he has deceived me like a double-meaning prophesier


has sat i' the stocks all night poor gallant knave

no matter his heels have deserved it in usurping his spurs so long How does he carry himself

I have told your lordship already the stocks carry him But to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confessed himself to Morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks and what think you he hath confessed

nothing of me has a'

his confession is taken and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be in't as I believe you are you must have the patience to hear it


a plague upon him muffled he can say nothing of me hush hush

hoodman comes Porto tartarossa

he calls for the tortures what will you say without em

I will confess what I know without constraint if ye pinch me like a pasty I can say no more

boblibindo chicurmurco

you are a merciful general Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note

and truly as I hope to live

first demand of him how many horse the duke is strong What say you to that

five or six thousand but very weak and unserviceable the troops are all scattered and the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation and credit and as I hope to live

shall I set down your answer so

do I'll take the sacrament on't how and which way you will

all's one to him What a past-saving slave is this

you are deceived my lord this is Monsieur Parolles the gallant militarist that was his own phrase that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf and the practice in the chape of his dagger
I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly

well that's set down

five or six thousand horse I said I will say true or thereabouts set down for I'll speak truth

he's very near the truth in this

but I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it

poor rogues I pray you say

well that's set down

I humbly thank you sir A truth's a truth the rogues are marvellous poor

demand of him of what strength they are a-foot What say you to that

by my troth sir if I were to live this present hour I will tell true Let me see Spurio a hundred and fifty Sebastian so many Corambus so many Jaques so many Guiltian Cosmo Lodowick and Gratii two hundred fifty each mine own company Chitopher Vaumond Bentii two hundred fifty each so that the muster-file rotten and sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces
what shall be done to him

nothing but let him have thanks Demand of him my condition and what credit I have with the duke

well that's set down You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumain be i' the camp a Frenchman what his reputation is with the duke what his valour honesty and expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt What say you to this what do you know of it

I beseech you let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories demand them singly

do you know this Captain Dumain

I know him a' was a botcher's prentice in Paris from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child a dumb innocent that could not say him nay


nay by your leave hold your hands though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls

well is this captain in the Duke of Florence's camp

upon my knowledge he is and lousy


what is his reputation with the duke

the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band I think I have his letter in my pocket

marry we'll search

in good sadness I do not know either it is there or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent

here tis here's a paper shall I read it to you

I do not know if it be it or no

our interpreter does it well

excellently

Dian the count's a fool and full of gold


nay I'll read it first by your favour

my meaning in't I protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds

damnable both-sides rogue

when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it
after he scores he never pays the score
half won is match well made match and well make it
he ne'er pays after-debts take it before
and say a soldier Dian told thee this
men are to mell with boys are not to kiss
for count of this the count's a fool I know it
who pays before but not when he does owe it

thine as he vow'd to thee in thine ear

he shall be whipped through the army with this rime in's forehead
this is your devoted friend sir the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier

I could endure anything before but a cat and now he's a cat to me

I perceive sir by our general's looks we shall be fain to hang you

my life sir in any case not that I am afraid to die but that my offences being many I would repent out the remainder of nature Let me live sir in a dungeon i' the stocks or anywhere so I may live

we'll see what may be done so you confess freely therefore once more to this Captain Dumain You have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour what is his honesty

he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus he professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he is stronger than Hercules he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine-drunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bed-clothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw I have but little more to say sir of his honesty he has everything that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothing

I begin to love him for this

for this description of thine honesty A pox upon him for me he is more and more a cat

what say you to his expertness in war

faith sir he has led the drum before the English tragedians to belie him I will not and more of his soldiership I know not except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the doubling of files I would do the man what honour I can but of this I am not certain
he hath out-villained villany so far that the rarity redeems him

a pox on him he's a cat still

his qualities being at this poor price I need not ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt

sir for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually

what's his brother the other Captain Dumain

why does he ask him or me

what's he

e'en a crow o' the same nest not altogether so great as the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil He excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is In a retreat he out-runs any lackey marry in coming on he has the cramp

if your life be saved will you undertake to betray the Florentine

ay and the captain of his horse Count Rousillon
I'll whisper with the general and know his pleasure

I'll no more drumming a plague of all drums Only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count have I run into this danger Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken

there is no remedy sir but you must die The general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore you must die Come headsman off with his head

O Lord sir let me live or let me see my death

that shall you and take your leave of all your friends

so look about you know you any here

good morrow noble captain

God bless you Captain Parolles

God save you noble captain

captain what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu I am for France
good captain will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon an I were not a very coward I'd compel it of you but fare you well


you are undone captain all but your scarf that has a knot on't yet

who cannot be crushed with a plot

if you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame you might begin an impudent nation Fare ye well sir I am for France too we shall speak of you there


yet am I thankful if my heart were great
'Twould burst at this Captain I'll be no more
but I will eat and drink and sleep as soft
as captain shall simply the thing I am
shall make me live Who knows himself a braggart
let him fear this for it will come to pass
that every braggart shall be found an ass
rust sword cool blushes and Parolles live
safest in shame being fool'd by foolery thrive
I'll after them


that you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you
one of the greatest in the Christian world
shall be my surety fore whose throne tis needful
ere I can perfect mine intents to kneel
time was I did him a desired office
dear almost as his life which gratitude
through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth
and answer thanks I duly am inform'd
his Grace is at Marseilles to which place
we have convenient convoy You must know
I am supposed dead the army breaking
my husband hies him home where heaven aiding
and by the leave of my good lord the king
we'll be before our welcome

gentle madam
your business was more welcome

nor you mistress
ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
to recompense your love Doubt not but heaven
hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower
as it hath fated her to be my motive
and helper to a husband But O strange men
that can such sweet use make of what they hate
when saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play
with what it loathes for that which is away
but more of this hereafter You Diana
under my poor instructions yet must suffer
something in my behalf

let death and honesty
go with your impositions I am yours
upon your will to suffer
yet I pray you
but with the word the time will bring on summer
when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
and be as sweet as sharp We must away
our waggon is prepar'd and time revives us
all's well that ends well still the fine's the crown
whate'er the course the end is the renown


no no no your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour and your son here at home more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of

I would I had not known him it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating If she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother I could not have owed her a more rooted love

'Twas a good lady twas a good lady we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb

indeed sir she was the sweet-marjoram of the salad or rather the herb of grace

they are not salad-herbs you knave they are nose-herbs


whether dost thou profess thyself a knave or a fool

a fool sir at a woman's service and a knave at a man's

your distinction

I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service

so you were a knave at his service indeed

and I would give his wife my bauble sir to do her service

I will subscribe for thee thou art both knave and fool

at your service

no no no


who's that a Frenchman

faith sir a' has an English name but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there

what prince is that

the black prince sir alias the prince of darkness alias the devil

hold thee there's my purse I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of serve him still

I am a woodland fellow sir that always loved a great fire and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire But sure he is the prince of the world let his nobility remain in's court I am for the house with the narrow gate which I take to be too little for pomp to enter some that humble themselves may but the many will be too chill and tender and they'll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire

go thy ways I begin to be aweary of thee and I tell thee so before because I would not fall out with thee Go thy ways let my horses be well looked to without any tricks

if I put any tricks upon em sir they shall be jade's tricks which are their own right by the law of nature


a shrewd knave and an unhappy
so he is My lord that's gone made himself much sport out of him by his authority he remains here which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness and indeed he has no pace but runs where he will

I like him well tis not amiss And I was about to tell you since I heard of the good lady's death and that my lord your son was upon his return home I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter which in the minority of them both his majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did first propose His highness hath promised me to do it and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son there is no fitter matter How does your ladyship like it

with very much content my lord and I wish it happily effected

his highness comes post from Marseilles of as able body as when he numbered thirty he will be here to-morrow or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed

it rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die I have letters that my son will be here to-night I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together

madam I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted

you need but plead your honourable privilege

lady of that I have made a bold charter but I thank my God it holds yet


O madam yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face whether there be a scar under it or no the velvet knows but tis a goodly patch of velvet His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half but his right cheek is worn bare


but it is your carbonadoed face

let us go see your son I pray you I long to talk with the young noble soldier

faith there's a dozen of em with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers which bow the head and nod at every man

but this exceeding posting day and night
must wear your spirits low we cannot help it
but since you have made the days and nights as one
to wear your gentle limbs in my affairs
be bold you do so grow in my requital
as nothing can unroot you In happy time


this man may help me to his majesty's ear

if he would spend his power God save you sir


sir I have seen you in the court of France

I have been sometimes there

I do presume sir that you are not fallen
from the report that goes upon your goodness
and therefore goaded with most sharp occasions
which lay nice manners by I put you to
the use of your own virtues for the which
I shall continue thankful

what's your will

that it will please you
to give this poor petition to the king
and aid me with that store of power you have
to come into his presence


not here sir

not indeed
he hence remov'd last night and with more haste
than is his use

lord how we lose our pains

all's well that ends well yet
though time seems so adverse and means unfit
I do beseech you whither is he gone

marry as I take it to Rousillon
whither I am going

I do beseech you sir
since you are like to see the king before me
commend the paper to his gracious hand
but rather make you thank your pains for it
I will come after you with what good speed
our means will make us means

this I'll do for you

and you shall find yourself to be well thank'd
whate'er falls more We must to horse again
go go provide


good Monsieur Lavache give my Lord Lafeu this letter I have ere now sir been better known to you when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes but I am now sir muddied in Fortune's mood and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure

truly Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune's buttering Prithee allow the wind

nay you need not to stop your nose sir I spake but by a metaphor

indeed sir if your metaphor stink I will stop my nose or against any man's metaphor Prithee get thee further


foh prithee stand away a paper from Fortune's close-stool to give to a nobleman Look here he comes himself


here is a purr of Fortune's sir or of Fortune's cat but not a musk-cat that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure and as he says is muddied withal Pray you sir use the carp as you may for he looks like a poor decayed ingenious foolish rascally knave I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to your lordship

my lord I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratched

and what would you have me to do tis too late to pare her nails now Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch you who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her There's a cardecu for you Let the justices make you and Fortune friends I am for other business

I beseech your honour to hear me one single word

you beg a single penny more come you shall ha't save your word

my name my good lord is Parolles

you beg more than one word then Cox my passion give me your hand How does your drum

O my good lord you were the first that found me
was I in sooth and I was the first that lost thee

it lies in you my lord to bring me in some grace for you did bring me out

out upon thee knave dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil one brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out

the king's coming I know by his trumpets Sirrah inquire further after me I had talk of you last night though you are a fool and a knave you shall eat go to follow

I praise God for you


we lost a jewel of her and our esteem
was made much poorer by it but your son
as mad in folly lack'd the sense to know
her estimation home

'Tis past my liege
and I beseech your majesty to make it
natural rebellion done i' the blaze of youth
o'erbears it and burns on

my honour'd lady
I have forgiven and forgotten all
though my revenges were high bent upon him
and watch'd the time to shoot

this I must say
but first I beg my pardon the young lord
did to his majesty his mother and his lady
offence of mighty note but to himself
the greatest wrong of all he lost a wife
whose beauty did astonish the survey
of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
humbly call'd mistress

praising what is lost
makes the remembrance dear Well call him hither
all repetition Let him not ask our pardon
the nature of his great offence is dead
and deeper than oblivion we do bury
the incensing relics of it let him approach
a stranger no offender and inform him
so tis our will he should

I shall my liege


what says he to your daughter have you spoke

all that he is hath reference to your highness

then shall we have a match I have letters sent me
that set him high in fame


he looks well on't
I am not a day of season
for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
in me at once but to the brightest beams
distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth
the time is fair again

my high-repented blames
dear sovereign pardon to me

all is whole
not one word more of the consumed time
let's take the instant by the forward top
for we are old and on our quick'st decrees
the inaudible and noiseless foot of time
steals ere we can effect them You remember
the daughter of this lord

admiringly my liege
at first I stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
where the impression of mine eye infixing
contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
which warp'd the line of every other favour
scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stolen
extended or contracted all proportions
to a most hideous object thence it came
that she whom all men prais'd and whom myself
since I have lost have lov'd was in mine eye
the dust that did offend it

well excus'd
that thou didst love her strikes some scores away
from the great compt But love that comes too late
like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
to the great sender turns a sour offence
crying That's good that's gone Our rasher faults
make trivial price of serious things we have
not knowing them until we know their grave
oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
our own love waking cries to see what's done
while shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon
be this sweet Helen's knell and now forget her
send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin
the main consents are had and here we'll stay
to see our widower's second marriage-day

which better than the first O dear heaven bless
or ere they meet in me O nature cesse

come on my son in whom my house's name
must be digested give a favour from you
to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
that she may quickly come

and every hair that's on't Helen that's dead
was a sweet creature such a ring as this
the last that e'er I took her leave at court
I saw upon her finger
hers it was not

now pray you let me see it for mine eye
while I was speaking oft was fasten'd to't
this ring was mine and when I gave it Helen
I bade her if her fortunes ever stood
necessitied to help that by this token
I would relieve her Had you that craft to reave her
of what should stead her most

my gracious sovereign
howe'er it pleases you to take it so
the ring was never hers

son on my life
I have seen her wear it and she reckon'd it
at her life's rate

I am sure I saw her wear it
you are deceiv'd my lord she never saw it
in Florence was it from a casement thrown me
wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name
of her that threw it Noble she was and thought
I stood engag'd but when I had subscrib'd
to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
as she had made the overture she ceas'd
in heavy satisfaction and would never
receive the ring again

Plutus himself
that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine
hath not in nature's mystery more science
than I have in this ring twas mine twas Helen's
whoever gave it you Then if you know
that you are well acquainted with yourself
confess twas hers and by what rough enforcement
you got it from her She call'd the saints to surety
unless she gave it to yourself in bed
where you have never come or sent it us
upon her great disaster

she never saw it

thou speak'st it falsely as I love mine honour
and mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
which I would fain shut out If it should prove
that thou art so inhuman twill not prove so
and yet I know not thou didst hate her deadly
and she is dead which nothing but to close
her eyes myself could win me to believe
more than to see this ring Take him away

my fore-past proofs howe'er the matter fall
shall tax my fears of little vanity
having vainly fear'd too little Away with him
we'll sift this matter further
if you shall prove
this ring was ever hers you shall as easy
prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence
where yet she never was


I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings


gracious sovereign
whether I have been to blame or no I know not
here's a petition from a Florentine
who hath for four or five removes come short
to tender it herself I undertook it
vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
of the poor suppliant who by this I know
is here attending her business looks in her
with an importing visage and she told me
in a sweet verbal brief it did concern

"Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won me Now is the Count Rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my honour's paid to him He stole from Florence taking no leave and I follow him to his country for justice Grant it me O king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor maid is undone DIANA CAPILET "

I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair and toll for this I'll none of him

the heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu
to bring forth this discovery Seek these suitors
go speedily and bring again the count

I am afeard the life of Helen lady
was foully snatch'd

now justice on the doers


I wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you
and that you fly them as you swear them lordship
yet you desire to marry


I am my lord a wretched Florentine
derived from the ancient Capilet
my suit as I do understand you know
and therefore know how far I may be pitied

I am her mother sir whose age and honour
both suffer under this complaint we bring
and both shall cease without your remedy

come hither county do you know these women

my lord I neither can nor will deny
but that I know them do they charge me further

why do you look so strange upon your wife

she's none of mine my lord

you give away this hand and that is mine
you give away heaven's vows and those are mine
you give away myself which is known mine
for I by vow am so embodied yours
that she which marries you must marry me
either both or none

your reputation comes too short for my daughter you are no husband for her

my lord this is a fond and desperate creature
whom sometime I have laugh'd with let your highness
lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
than for to think that I would sink it here

sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour
than in my thought it lies

good my lord
he had not my virginity

what sayst thou to her

she's impudent my lord
and was a common gamester to the camp

he does me wrong my lord if I were so
he might have bought me at a common price
do not believe him O behold this ring
whose high respect and rich validity
did lack a parallel yet for all that
he gave it to a commoner o' the camp
if I be one

he blushes and tis it
of six preceding ancestors that gem
conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue
hath it been ow'd and worn This is his wife

methought you said
you saw one here in court could witness it

I did my lord but loath am to produce
so bad an instrument his name's Parolles

I saw the man to-day if man he be

find him and bring him hither


what of him
he's quoted for a most perfidious slave
with all the spots of the world tax'd and debosh'd
whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
am I or that or this for what he'll utter
that will speak anything


I think she has certain it is I lik'd her
and boarded her i' the wanton way of youth
she knew her distance and did angle for me
madding my eagerness with her restraint
as all impediments in fancy's course
are motives of more fancy and in fine
her infinite cunning with her modern grace
subdued me to her rate she got the ring
and I had that which any inferior might
at market-price have bought

I must be patient
you that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
may justly diet me I pray you yet
since you lack virtue I will lose a husband
send for your ring I will return it home
and give me mine again


what ring was yours I pray you

sir much like
the same upon your finger

know you this ring this ring was his of late

and this was it I gave him being a-bed

the story then goes false you threw it him
out of a casement

I have spoke the truth


my lord I do confess the ring was hers

you boggle shrewdly every feather starts you

ay my lord

tell me sirrah but tell me true I charge you
not fearing the displeasure of your master
which on your just proceeding I'll keep off
by him and by this woman here what know you

so please your majesty my master hath been an honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him which gentlemen have

come come to the purpose did he love this woman

faith sir he did love her but how

how I pray you

he did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman

how is that
he loved her sir and loved her not

as thou art a knave and no knave
what an equivocal companion is this

I am a poor man and at your majesty's command

he is a good drum my lord but a naughty orator

do you know he promised me marriage

faith I know more than I'll speak

but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest

yes so please your majesty I did go between them as I said but more than that he loved her for indeed he was mad for her and talked of Satan and of limbo and of Furies and I know not what yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of therefore I will not speak what I know

thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand aside This ring you say was yours


where did you buy it or who gave it you

it was not given me nor I did not buy it

who lent it you

it was not lent me neither

where did you find it then

I found it not

if it were yours by none of all these ways
how could you give it him

I never gave it him

this woman's an easy glove my lord she goes off and on at pleasure
this ring was mine I gave it his first wife

it might be yours or hers for aught I know

take her away I do not like her now
to prison with her and away with him
unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring
thou diest within this hour

I'll never tell you

take her away

I'll put in bail my liege

I think thee now some common customer

by Jove if ever I knew man twas you


because he's guilty and he is not guilty
he knows I am no maid and he'll swear to't
I'll swear I am a maid and he knows not
great king I am no strumpet by my life
I am either maid or else this old man's wife


she does abuse our ears to prison with her

good mother fetch my bail

stay royal sir
the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
and he shall surety me But for this lord
who hath abus'd me as he knows himself
though yet he never harm'd me here I quit him
he knows himself my bed he hath defil'd
and at that time he got his wife with child
so there's my riddle one that's dead is quick
and now behold the meaning


is there no exorcist
beguiles the truer office of mine eyes
is't real that I see

no my good lord
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see
the name and not the thing

both both O pardon

O my good lord when I was like this maid
I found you wondrous kind There is your ring
and look you here's your letter this it says
when from my finger you can get this ring
and are by me with child &c This is done

if she my liege can make me know this clearly
I'll love her dearly ever ever dearly

if it appear not plain and prove untrue
deadly divorce step between me and you
O my dear mother do I see you living

mine eyes smell onions I shall weep anon

good Tom Drum lend me a handkercher so I thank thee Wait on me home I'll make sport with thee let thy curtsies alone they are scurvy ones

let us from point to point this story know
to make the even truth in pleasure flow


if thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower
choose thou thy husband and I'll pay thy dower
for I can guess that by thy honest aid
of that and all the progress more and less
resolvedly more leisure shall express
all yet seems well and if it end so meet
the bitter past more welcome is the sweet

spoken by the The king's a beggar now the play is done
all is well ended if this suit be won
that you express content which we will pay
with strife to please you day exceeding day
ours be your patience then and yours our parts
your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts

AS YOU LIKE IT

as I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayest charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it

yonder comes my master your brother

go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up

now sir what make you here

nothing I am not taught to make anything

what mar you then sir

marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness

marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile

shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury

know you where you are sir

O sir very well here in your orchard

know you before whom sir


what boy

come come elder brother you are too young in this

wilt thou lay hands on me villain

I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself

sweet masters be patient for your father's remembrance be at accord

let me go I say

I will not till I please you shall hear me My father charged you in his will to give me good education you have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy my fortunes

and what wilt thou do beg when that is spent Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled with you you shall have some part of your will I pray you leave me

I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good


is old dog' my reward Most true I have lost my teeth in your service God be with my old master he would not have spoke such a word


is it even so begin you to grow upon me I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla Dennis


calls your worship

was not Charles the duke's wrestler here to speak with me

so please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you

call him in

'Twill be a good way and to-morrow the wrestling is


good morrow to your worship
good Monsieur Charles what's the new news at the new court

there's no news at the court sir but the old news that is the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander

can you tell if Rosalind the duke's daughter be banished with her father

O no for the duke's daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do

where will the old duke live

they say he is already in the forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world

what you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke

marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall To-morrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will

Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute I'll tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every man's good parts a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger And thou wert best look to't for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villanous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder

I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come to-morrow I'll give him his payment if ever he go alone again I'll never wrestle for prize more and so God keep your worship

farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an end of him for my soul yet I know not why hates nothing more than he Yet he's gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that I am altogether misprised But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither which now I'll go about

I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry

dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure

herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee

well I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours

you know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection by mine honour I will and when I break that oath let me turn monster Therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry

from henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let me see what think you of falling in love

marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again

what shall be our sport then


I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women

'Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly

nay now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of Nature


no when Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument

indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit

peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither but Nature's who perceiving our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits How now wit whither wander you

mistress you must come away to your father

were you made the messenger

no by mine honour but I was bid to come for you
where learned you that oath fool

of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught now I'll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn

how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge

ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom

stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave

by our beards if we had them thou art

by my knavery if I had it then I were but if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard

prithee who is't that thou meanest

one that old Frederick your father loves

my father's love is enough to honour him Enough speak no more of him you'll be whipped for taxation one of these days
the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly

by my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le Beau

with his mouth full of news

which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young

then we shall be news-cramm'd

all the better we shall be more marketable

bon jour Monsieur Le Beau what's the news

fair princess you have lost much good sport

sport Of what colour

what colour madam How shall

as wit and fortune will

or as the Destinies decree

well said that was laid on with a trowel

nay if I keep not my rank

thou losest thy old smell

you amaze me ladies I would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of

yet tell us the manner of the wrestling

I will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it

well the beginning that is dead and buried


I could match this beginning with an old tale

three proper young men of excellent growth and presence

with bills on their necks Be it known unto all men by these presents

the eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the duke's wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him so he served the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping

alas

but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost

why this that I speak of

thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies

or I I promise thee


you must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it

yonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see it


come on since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness

is yonder the man

even he madam

alas he is too young yet he looks successfully

how now daughter and cousin are you crept hither to see the wrestling

ay my liege so please you give us leave

you will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man in pity of the challenger's youth I would fam dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if you can move him
call him hither good Monsieur le Beau

do so I'll not be by


Monsieur the challenger the princes call for you

I attend them with all respect and duty

young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler

no fair princess he is the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth

young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt

do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised We will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward

I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty


and mine to eke out hers

fare you well Pray heaven I be deceived in you

your heart's desires be with you

come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth

ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working

you shall try but one fall

no I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first

you mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before but come your ways

now Hercules be thy speed young man



O excellent young man

if I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down


no more no more

yes I beseech your Grace I am not yet well breathed

how dost thou Charles

he cannot speak my lord

bear him away What is thy name young man


Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys
I would thou hadst been son to some man else
the world esteem'd thy father honourable
but I did find him still mine enemy
thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed
hadst thou descended from another house
but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
I would thou hadst told me of another father


were I my father coz would I do this

I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son
his youngest son and would not change that calling
to be adopted heir to Frederick

my father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul
and all the world was of my father's mind
had I before known this young man his son
I should have given him tears unto entreaties

gentle cousin
let us go thank him and encourage him
my father's rough and envious disposition
sticks me at heart Sir you have well deserv'd
if you do keep your promises in love
but justly as you have exceeded all promise
your mistress shall be happy

gentleman

wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
that could give more but that her hand lacks means
shall we go coz

ay Fare you well fair gentleman

can I not say I thank you My better parts
are all thrown down and that which here stands up

he calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes
I'll ask him what he would Did you call sir
sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
more than your enemies

will you go coz

have with you Fare you well


what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
I cannot speak to her yet she urg'd conference
O poor Orlando thou art overthrown
or Charles or something weaker masters thee


good sir I do in friendship counsel you
to leave this place Albeit you have deserv'd
yet such is now the duke's condition
that he misconstrues all that you have done
the duke is humorous what he is indeed
more suits you to conceive than I to speak of

I thank you sir and pray you tell me this
which of the two was daughter of the duke
that here was at the wrestling

neither his daughter if we judge by manners
but yet indeed the smaller is his daughter
the other is daughter to the banish'd duke
and here detain'd by her usurping uncle
to keep his daughter company whose loves
are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
but I can tell you that of late this duke
hath ta'en displeasure gainst his gentle niece
grounded upon no other argument
but that the people praise her for her virtues
and on my life his malice gainst the lady
will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well
hereafter in a better world than this
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you

I rest much bounden to you fare you well

thus must I from the smoke into the smother
from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
but heavenly Rosalind


why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy Not a word

not one to throw at a dog

no thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons

then there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any
but is all this for your father

no some of it is for my child's father
O how full of briers is this working-day world

they are but burrs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them

I could shake them off my coat these burrs are in my heart

hem them away

I would try if I could cry hem and have him

come come wrestle with thy affections

O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself

O a good wish upon you you will try in time in despite of a fall But turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son


doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate not Orlando

no faith hate him not for my sake

why should I not doth he not deserve well

let me love him for that and do you love him because I do Look here comes the duke

with his eyes full of anger


mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
and get you from our court

me uncle

you cousin
within these ten days if that thou be'st found
thou diest for it

I do beseech your Grace
let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
if with myself I hold intelligence
or have acquaintance with mine own desires
if that I do not dream or be not frantic
as I do trust I am not then dear uncle
never so much as in a thought unborn
did I offend your highness

thus do all traitors
if their purgation did consist in words
they are as innocent as grace itself
let it suffice thee that I trust thee not

yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
tell me whereon the likelihood depends


so was I when your highness took his dukedom
so was I when your highness banish'd him
treason is not inherited my lord
or if we did derive it from our friends
what's that to me my father was no traitor
then good my liege mistake me not so much
to think my poverty is treacherous

dear sovereign hear me speak

ay Celia we stay'd her for your sake
else had she with her father rang'd along

I did not then entreat to have her stay
it was your pleasure and your own remorse
I was too young that time to value her
but now I know her if she be a traitor
why so am I we still have slept together
and wheresoe'er we went like Juno's swans
still we went coupled and inseparable

she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
her very silence and her patience
speak to the people and they pity her
thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
when she is gone Then open not thy lips
firm and irrevocable is my doom
which I have pass'd upon her she is banish'd

pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
I cannot live out of her company

you are a fool You niece provide yourself
if you outstay the time upon mine honour
and in the greatness of my word you die

O my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou go
wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine
I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am

I have more cause

thou hast not cousin
prithee be cheerful know'st thou not the duke
hath banish'd me his daughter

that he hath not

no hath not Rosalind lacks then the love
which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
shall we be sunder'd shall we part sweet girl
no let my father seek another heir
therefore devise with me how we may fly
whither to go and what to bear with us
and do not seek to take your change upon you
for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
say what thou canst I'll go along with thee

why whither shall we go

to seek my uncle in the forest of Arden

alas what danger will it be to us
maids as we are to travel forth so far
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold

I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
and with a kind of umber smirch my face
the like do you so shall we pass along
and never stir assailants

were it not better
because that I am more than common tall
that I did suit me all points like a man
a boar-spear in my hand and in my heart
lie there what hidden woman's fear there will
we'll have a swashing and a martial outside
as many other mannish cowards have
that do outface it with their semblances

what shall I call thee when thou art a man

I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page
and therefore look you call me Ganymede
but what will you be call'd

something that hath a reference to my state
no longer Celia but Aliena

but cousin what if we assay'd to steal
the clownish fool out of your father's court
would he not be a comfort to our travel

leave me alone to woo him Let's away
and get our jewels and our wealth together
devise the fittest time and safest way
to hide us from pursuit that will be made
after my flight Now go we in content
to liberty and not to banishment

now my co-mates and brothers in exile
hath not old custom made this life more sweet
than that of painted pomp Are not these woods
more free from peril than the envious court
here feel we but the penalty of Adam
the seasons' difference as the icy fang
and churlish chiding of the winter's wind
which when it bites and blows upon my body
even till I shrink with cold I smile and say
'This is no flattery these are counsellors
that feelingly persuade me what I am
sweet are the uses of adversity
wears yet a precious jewel in his head
and this our life exempt from public haunt
finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
sermons in stones and good in every thing
I would not change it

happy is your Grace
that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
into so quiet and so sweet a style

come shall we go and kill us venison
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
being native burghers of this desert city
should in their own confines with forked heads
have their round haunches gor'd

indeed my lord
the melancholy Jaques grieves at that
and in that kind swears you do more usurp
to-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
did steal behind him as he lay along
under an oak whose antique root peeps out
upon the brook that brawls along this wood
to the which place a poor sequester'd stag
that from the hunters' aim had ta'en a hurt
did come to languish and indeed my lord
the wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
almost to bursting and the big round tears
cours'd one another down his innocent nose
in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
much marked of the melancholy Jaques
stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
augmenting it with tears

but what said Jaques
did he not moralize this spectacle

first for his weeping into the needless stream
'Poor deer quoth he thou mak'st a testament
as worldlings do giving thy sum of more
to that which had too much then being there alone
left and abandon'd of his velvet friends
''Tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
the flux of company anon a careless herd
full of the pasture jumps along by him
and never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques
'Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
'Tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
upon that poor and broken bankrupt there
thus most invectively he pierceth through
the body of the country city court
yea and of this our life swearing that we
are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse
to fright the animals and to kill them up
in their assign'd and native dwelling-place


we did my lord weeping and commenting
upon the sobbing deer

show me the place
I love to cope him in these sullen fits
for then he's full of matter

I'll bring you to him straight


can it be possible that no man saw them
it cannot be some villains of my court
are of consent and sufferance in this

I cannot hear of any that did see her
the ladies her attendants of her chamber
saw her a-bed and in the morning early
they found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress
my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing
hisperia the princess' gentlewoman
confesses that she secretly o'erheard
your daughter and her cousin much commend
the parts and graces of the wrestler
that did but lately foil the sinewy Charles
and she believes wherever they are gone
that youth is surely in their company

send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
if he be absent bring his brother to me
I'll make him find him Do this suddenly
and let not search and inquisition quail
to bring again these foolish runaways


who's there

O my sweet master O you memory
of old Sir Rowland why what make you here
why are you virtuous Why do people love you
and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
why would you be so fond to overcome
the bony priser of the humorous duke
your praise is come too swiftly home before you
know you not master to some kind of men
their graces serve them but as enemies
no more do yours your virtues gentle master
are sanctified and holy traitors to you
O what a world is this when what is comely
envenoms him that bears it

why what's the matter

O unhappy youth
come not within these doors within this roof
the enemy of all your graces lives
yet not the son I will not call him son
of him I was about to call his father
hath heard your praises and this night he means
to burn the lodging where you use to lie
and you within it if he fail of that
he will have other means to cut you off
I overheard him and his practices
this is no place this house is but a butchery
abhor it fear it do not enter it

why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go

no matter whither so you come not here

what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
a thievish living on the common road
this I must do or know not what to do
yet this I will not do do how I can
of a diverted blood and bloody brother

but do not so I have five hundred crowns
the thrifty hire I sav'd under your father
which I did store to be my foster-nurse
when service should in my old limbs lie lame
and unregarded age in corners thrown
take that and He that doth the ravens feed
yea providently caters for the sparrow
be comfort to my age Here is the gold
all this I give you Let me be your servant
though I look old yet I am strong and lusty
for in my youth I never did apply
hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
the means of weakness and debility
therefore my age is as a lusty winter
frosty but kindly Let me go with you
I'll do the service of a younger man

O good old man how well in thee appears
the constant service of the antique world
when service sweat for duty not for meed
thou art not for the fashion of these times
where none will sweat but for promotion
and having that do choke their service up
even with the having it is not so with thee
but poor old man thou prun'st a rotten tree
that cannot so much as a blossom yield
in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
but come thy ways we'll go along together
and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
we'll light upon some settled low content

master go on and I will follow thee
to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore
here lived I but now live here no more
but at fourscore it is too late a week
yet fortune cannot recompense me better
than to die well and not my master's debtor


O Jupiter how weary are my spirits

I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary

I could find it in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage good Aliena

I pray you bear with me I cannot go no further

for my part I had rather bear with you than bear you yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you for I think you have no money in your purse

well this is the forest of Arden

ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was at home I was in a better place but travellers must be content



that is the way to make her scorn you still

O Corin that thou knew'st how I do love her

I partly guess for I have lov'd ere now

no Corin being old thou canst not guess
though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow
but if thy love were ever like to mine
as sure I think did never man love so
how many actions most ridiculous
hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy

into a thousand that I have forgotten

O thou didst then ne'er love so heartily
that ever love did make thee run into
thou hast not lov'd
or if thou hast not sat as I do now
wearing thy hearer with thy mistress' praise
thou hast not lov'd
or if thou hast not broke from company
abruptly as my passion now makes me
thou hast not lov'd O Phebe Phebe Phebe


alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
I have by hard adventure found mine own

and I mine I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile and I remember the kissing of her batler and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took two cods and giving her them again said with weeping tears Wear these for my sake We that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly

thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of

nay I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it

is much upon my fashion

and mine but it grows something stale with me

I pray you one of you question yond man
if he for gold will give us any food
I faint almost to death

holla you clown

peace fool he's not thy kinsman

who calls

your betters sir

else are they very wretched

peace I say Good even to you friend
and to you gentle sir and to you all

I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
can in this desert place buy entertainment
bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
and faints for succour

fair sir I pity her
and wish for her sake more than for mine own
my fortunes were more able to relieve her
but I am shepherd to another man
and do not shear the fleeces that I graze
my master is of churlish disposition
and little recks to find the way to heaven
by doing deeds of hospitality
besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
by reason of his absence there is nothing
and in my voice most welcome shall you be

what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture

that young swain that you saw here but erewhile
that little cares for buying anything

I pray thee if it stand with honesty
buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
and thou shalt have to pay for it of us

and we will mend thy wages I like this place
and willingly could waste my time in it

assuredly the thing is to be sold
go with me if you like upon report
the soil the profit and this kind of life
I will your very faithful feeder be
and buy it with your gold right suddenly

under the greenwood tree
who loves to lie with me
and turn his merry note
unto the sweet bird's throat
come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see
no enemy
but winter and rough weather

more more I prithee more

it will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques

I thank it More I prithee more I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs More I prithee more

my voice is ragged I know I cannot please you

I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to sing Come more another stanzo call you them stanzos
what you will Monsieur Jaques

nay I care not for their names they owe me nothing Will you sing

more at your request than to please myself

well then if ever I thank any man I'll thank you but that they call compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes and when a man thanks me heartily methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks Come sing and you that will not hold your tongues

well I'll end the song Sirs cover the while the duke will drink under this tree He hath been all this day to look you

and I have been all this day to avoid him He is too disputable for my company I think of as many matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them Come warble come

who doth ambition shun

and loves to live i' the sun
secking the food he eats
and pleas'd with what he gets
come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see
but winter and rough weather

I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention

and I'll sing it

thus it goes

if it do come to pass
that any man turn ass
leaving his wealth and ease
a stubborn will to please
ducdame ducdame ducdame
here shall he see
gross fools as he
an if he will come to me


what's that ducdame
'Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle I'll go sleep if I can if I cannot I'll rail against all the first-born of Egypt

and I'll go seek the duke his banquet is prepared


dear master I can go no further O I die for food Here lie I down and measure out my grave Farewell kind master

why how now Adam no greater heart in thee Live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little If this uncouth forest yield anything savage I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the arm's end I will here be with thee presently and if I bring thee not something to eat I will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before I come thou art a mocker of my labour Well said thou lookest cheerly and I'll be with thee quickly Yet thou liest in the bleak air come I will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert Cheerly good Adam


I think he be transform'd into a beast
for I can nowhere find him like a man

my lord he is but even now gone hence
here was he merry hearing of a song

if he compact of jars grow musical
we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
go seek him tell him I would speak with him
he saves my labour by his own approach


why how now monsieur what a life is this
that your poor friends must woo your company
what you look merrily

a fool a fool I met a fool i' the forest
a motley fool a miserable world
as I do live by food I met a fool
who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun
and rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms
in good set terms and yet a motley fool
'Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
and then he drew a dial from his poke
and looking on it with lack-lustre eye
says very wisely It is ten o'clock
thus may we see quoth he how the world wags
and after one hour more twill be eleven
and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
and thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
the motley fool thus moral on the time
my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
that fools should be so deep-contemplative
and I did laugh sans intermission
an hour by his dial O noble fool
a worthy fool Motley's the only wear

what fool is this

O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
and says if ladies be but young and fair
they have the gift to know it and in his brain
which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
after a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd
with observation the which he vents
I am ambitious for a motley coat

thou shalt have one

it is my only suit
provided that you weed your better judgments
of all opinion that grows rank in them
that I am wise I must have liberty
withal as large a charter as the wind
to blow on whom I please for so fools have
and they that are most galled with my folly
they most must laugh And why sir must they so
the why' is plain as way to parish church
he that a fool doth very wisely hit
doth very foolishly although he smart
not to seem senseless of the bob if not
the wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
even by the squandering glances of the fool
invest me in my motley give me leave
cleanse the foul body of th' infected world
if they will patiently receive my medicine

fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do

what for a counter would I do but good

most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
for thou thyself hast been a libertine
as sensual as the brutish sting itself
and all the embossed sores and headed evils
that thou with licence of free foot hast caught
wouldst thou disgorge into the general world

why who cries out on pride
that can therein tax any private party
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
till that the weary very means do ebb
what woman in the city do I name
the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
who can come in and say that I mean her
when such a one as she such is her neighbour
or what is he of basest function
that says his bravery is not on my cost
thinking that I mean him but therein suits
his folly to the mettle of my speech
there then how then what then Let me see wherein
my tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right
then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free
why then my taxing like a wild goose flies
unclaim'd of any man But who comes here


forbear and eat no more

why I have eat none yet

nor shalt not till necessity be serv'd
of what kind should this cock come of

art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress
or else a rude despiser of good manners
that in civility thou seem'st so empty

you touch'd my vein at first the thorny point
of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
of smooth civility yet I am inland bred
and know some nurture But forbear I say
he dies that touches any of this fruit
till I and my affairs are answered

an you will not be answered with reason
I must die

what would you have Your gentleness shall force
more than your force move us to gentleness


sit down and feed and welcome to our table

speak you so gently Pardon me I pray you
I thought that all things had been savage here
and therefore put I on the countenance
of stern commandment But whate'er you are
that in this desert inaccessible
under the shade of melancholy boughs
lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
if ever you have look'd on better days
if ever been where bells have knoll'd to church
if ever sat at any good man's feast
if ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear
and know what tis to pity and be pitied
let gentleness my strong enforcement be
in the which hope I blush and hide my sword

true is it that we have seen better days
and sat at good men's feasts and wip'd our eyes
of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd
and therefore sit you down in gentleness
and take upon command what help we have
that to your wanting may be minister'd

then but forbear your food a little while
whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
and give it food There is an old poor man
who after me hath many a weary step
limp'd in pure love till he be first suffic'd
oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger
I will not touch a bit

go find him out
and we will nothing waste till you return

I thank ye and be bless'd for your good comfort

thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
this wide and universal theatre
presents more woful pageants than the scene
wherein we play in

all the world's a stage
and all the men and women merely players
they have their exits and their entrances
and one man in his time plays many parts
his acts being seven ages At first the infant
mewling and puking in the nurse's arms
and then the whining school-boy with his satchel
and shining morning face creeping like snail
unwillingly to school And then the lover
sighing like furnace with a woful ballad
made to his mistress' eyebrow Then a soldier
full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
seeking the bubble reputation
in fair round belly with good capon lin'd
with eyes severe and beard of formal cut
full of wise saws and modern instances
and so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon
with spectacles on nose and pouch on side
his youthful hose well sav'd a world too wide
for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
turning again toward childish treble pipes
and whistles in his sound Last scene of all
that ends this strange eventful history
is second childishness and mere oblivion
sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything


welcome Set down your venerable burden
and let him feed

I thank you most for him
so had you need
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself

welcome fall to I will not trouble you
as yet to question you about your fortunes
give us some music and good cousin sing

blow blow thou winter wind
thou art not so unkind
as man's ingratitude
thy tooth is not so keen
because thou art not seen
although thy breath be rude
heigh-ho sing heigh-ho unto the green holly
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
then heigh-ho the holly
this life is most jolly
freeze freeze thou bitter sky
that dost not bite so nigh
though thou the waters warp
thy sting is not so sharp
as friend remember'd not
heigh-ho sing heigh-ho unto the green holly
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
then heigh-ho the holly
this life is most jolly

if that you were the good Sir Rowland's son
as you have whisper'd faithfully you were
and as mine eye doth his effigies witness
most truly limn'd and living in your face
be truly welcome hither I am the duke
that lov'd your father the residue of your fortune
go to my cave and tell me Good old man
thou art right welcome as thy master is
support him by the arm Give me your hand
and let me all your fortunes understand

but were I not the better part made mercy
I should not seek an absent argument
of my revenge thou present But look to it
find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is
seek him with candle bring him dead or living
within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more
to seek a living in our territory
thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
worth seizure do we seize into our hands
till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
of what we think against thee

O that your highness knew my heart in this
I never lov'd my brother in my life

more villain thou Well push him out of doors
and let my officers of such a nature
make an extent upon his house and lands
do this expediently and turn him going

hang there my verse in witness of my love
and thou thrice-crowned queen of night survey
with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway
O Rosalind these trees shall be my books
and in their barks my thoughts I'll character
that every eye which in this forest looks
shall see thy virtue witness'd everywhere
run run Orlando carve on every tree
the fair the chaste and unexpressive she

and how like you this shepherd's life Master Touchstone

truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life it is naught In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd

no more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred

such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in court shepherd
no truly

then thou art damned

nay I hope

truly thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg all on one side

for not being at court Your reason

why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest good manners if thou never sawest good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous state shepherd

not a whit Touchstone those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds

instance briefly come instance

why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasy

why do not your courtier's hands sweat and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow shallow A better instance I say come
besides our hands are hard

your lips will feel them the sooner shallow again A more sounder instance come

and they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The courtier's hands are perfumed with civet

most shallow man Thou worms-meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherd

you have too courtly a wit for me I'll rest

wilt thou rest damned God help thee shallow man God make incision in thee thou art raw

sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get that I wear owe no man hate envy no man's happiness glad of other men's good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck

that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldy ram out of all reasonable match If thou be'st not damned for this the devil himself will have no shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape

here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistress's brother

from the east to western Ind
her worth being mounted on the wind
through all the world bears Rosalind
all the pictures fairest lin'd
are but black to Rosalind
let no face be kept in mind
but the fair of Rosalind


I'll rime you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted it is the right butter-women's rank to market

out fool

for a taste

if a hart do lack a hind
let him seek out Rosalind
if the cat will after kind
so be sure will Rosalind
winter-garments must be lin'd
they that reap must sheaf and bind
then to cart with Rosalind
sweetest nut hath sourest rind
such a nut is Rosalind
he that sweetest rose will find
must find love's prick and Rosalind

this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with them

peace you dull fool I found them on a tree

truly the tree yields bad fruit

I'll graff it with you and then I shall graff it with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit i' the country for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe and that's the right virtue of the medlar

you have said but whether wisely or no let the forest judge


peace


why should this a desert be
for it is unpeopled No
tongues I'll hang on every tree
that shall civil sayings show
some how brief the life of man
runs his erring pilgrimage
that the stretching of a span
buckles in his sum of age
some of violated vows
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend
but upon the fairest boughs
or at every sentence' end
will I Rosalinda write
teaching all that read to know
the quintessence of every sprite
heaven would in little show
therefore Heaven Nature charg'd
with all graces wide enlarg'd
nature presently distill'd
Helen's cheek but not her heart
Cleopatra's majesty
Atalanta's better part
sad Lucretia's modesty
thus Rosalind of many parts
by heavenly synod was devis'd
of many faces eyes and hearts
to have the touches dearest priz'd
heaven would that she these gifts should have
and I to live and die her slave


O most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried Have patience good people

how now back friends Shepherd go off a little go with him sirrah

come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage

didst thou hear these verses

O yes I heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear

that's no matter the feet might bear the verses

ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse

but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees

I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what I found on a palm-tree I was never so be-rimed since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat which I can hardly remember

trow you who hath done this

is it a man

and a chain that you once wore about his neck Change you colour


O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter

nay but who is it

is it possible

nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is

O wonderful wonderful and most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping

good my complexion dost thou think though I am caparison'd like a man I have a doublet and hose in my disposition One inch of delay more is a South-sea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace I would thou couldst stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouth'd bottle either too much at once or none at all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings

so you may put a man in your belly

is he of God's making What manner of man Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard

nay he hath but a little beard


it is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant

nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maid

i' faith coz tis he

Orlando

Orlando

alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and hose What did he when thou sawest him What said he How looked he Wherein went he What makes he here Did he ask for me Where remains he How parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again Answer me in one word

you must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism

but doth he know that I am in this forest and in man's apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled

it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn


give me audience good madam

proceed

there lay he stretch'd along like a wounded knight

though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground

cry holla to thy tongue I prithee it curvets unseasonably He was furnish'd like a hunter

O ominous he comes to kill my heart

I would sing my song without a burthen thou bringest me out of tune

do you not know I am a woman when I think I must speak Sweet say on

you bring me out Soft comes he not here



I thank you for your company but good faith I had as lief have been myself alone

and so had I but yet for fashion' sake I thank you too for your society

God be wi' you let's meet as little as we can

I do desire we may be better strangers

I pray you mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their barks

I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly

Rosalind is your love's name

yes just

I do not like her name
there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened

what stature is she of

just as high as my heart

you are full of pretty answers Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives and conn'd them out of rings

not so but I answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions

you have a nimble wit I think twas made of Atalanta's heels Will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery

I will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom I know most faults

the worst fault you have is to be in love

'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue I am weary of you

by my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found you
he is drowned in the brook look but in and you shall see him

there I shall see mine own figure

which I take to be either a fool or a cipher

I'll tarry no longer with you Farewell good Signior Love

I am glad of your departure Adieu good Monsieur Melancholy


I will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him Do you hear forester

very well what would you

I pray you what is't o'clock

you should ask me what time o' day there's no clock in the forest


and why not the swift foot of Time had not that been as proper

by no means sir Time travels in divers paces with divers persons I'll tell you who Time ambles withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops withal and who he stands still withal

I prithee who doth he trot withal

marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year

who ambles Time withal

with a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These Time ambles withal

who doth he gallop withal

with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there

who stays it still withal


where dwell you pretty youth

with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat

are you native of this place

as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled

your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling

I have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal

can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women

there were none principal they were all like one another as half-pence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it

I prithee recount some of them


I am he that is so love-shaked I pray you tell me your remedy

there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner

what were his marks

a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue Then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man you are rather point-device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other

fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love

me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired

I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he

but are you so much in love as your rimes speak

neither rime nor reason can express how much


did you ever cure any so

yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic And thus I cured him and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in't

I would not be cured youth

I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me

now by the faith of my love I will tell me where it is

go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you go

with all my heart good youth

nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go


come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your goats Audrey And how Audrey am I the man yet doth my simple feature content you
your features Lord warrant us what features

I am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths

O knowledge ill-inhabited worse than Jove in a thatch'd house

when a man's verses cannot be understood nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child Understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room Truly I would the gods had made thee poetical

I do not know what poetical' is Is it honest in deed and word Is it a true thing

no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign

do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical

I do truly for thou swearest to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst feign

would you not have me honest

no truly unless thou wert hard-favour'd for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
a material fool

well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me honest

truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish

I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul

well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may be I will marry thee and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us

I would fain see this meeting

well the gods give us joy

amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn-beasts But what though Courage As horns are odious they are necessary It is said many a man knows no end of his goods right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting Horns Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man therefore blessed No as a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is a horn more precious than to want Here comes Sir Oliver

sir Oliver Martext you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel

is there none here to give the woman
I will not take her on gift of any man

truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful

proceed proceed I'll give her

good even good Master What-ye-call't how do you sir You are very well met God ild you for your last company I am very glad to see you even a toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered

will you be married motley

as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling

and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar Get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp

I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife

go thou with me and let me counsel thee

come sweet Audrey
farewell good Master Oliver not

O sweet Oliver
O brave Oliver
leave me not behind thee

but

wind away
Begone I say
I will not to wedding with thee

'Tis no matter ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling


never talk to me I will weep

do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man


as good cause as one would desire therefore weep

his very hair is of the dissembling colour

something browner than Judas's marry his kisses are Judas's own children

i' faith his hair is of a good colour

an excellent colour your chesnut was ever the only colour

and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread

he hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana a nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them

but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not

nay certainly there is no truth in him


yes I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer but for his verity in love I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut

not true in love

yes when he is in but I think he is not in

you have heard him swear downright he was

'Was' is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmers of false reckonings He attends here in the forest on the duke your father

I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him He asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando

O that's a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides Who comes here


mistress and master you have oft inquir'd
after the shepherd that complain'd of love
who you saw sitting by me on the turf
that was his mistress

well and what of him

if you will see a pageant truly play'd
between the pale complexion of true love
and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
go hence a little and I shall conduct you
if you will mark it

O come let us remove
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
bring us to this sight and you shall say
I'll prove a busy actor in their play


sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe
say that you love me not but say not so
in bitterness The common executioner
falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
but first begs pardon will you sterner be
than he that dies and lives by bloody drops


I would not be thy executioner
I fly thee for I would not injure thee
thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye
'Tis pretty sure and very probable
that eyes that are the frail'st and softest things
who shut their coward gates on atomies
should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers
now I do frown on thee with all my heart
and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
now counterfeit to swound why now fall down
or if thou canst not O for shame for shame
lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
the cicatrice and capable impressure
thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
that can do hurt

O dear Phebe
if ever as that ever may be near
you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
then shall you know the wounds invisible
that love's keen arrows make

but till that time
come not thou near me and when that time comes
afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
as till that time I shall not pity thee

and why I pray you Who might be your mother
that you insult exult and all at once
as by my faith I see no more in you
than without candle may go dark to bed
must you be therefore proud and pitiless
why what means this Why do you look on me
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
of nature's sale-work Od's my little life
I think she means to tangle my eyes too
no faith proud mistress hope not after it
'Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
that can entame my spirits to your worship
you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
you are a thousand times a properer man
than she a woman tis such fools as you
that make the world full of ill-favour'd children
'Tis not her glass but you that flatters her
and out of you she sees herself more proper
than any of her lineaments can show her
and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love
for I must tell you friendly in your ear
sell when you can you are not for all markets
cry the man mercy love him take his offer
foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
so take her to thee shepherd Fare you well

sweet youth I pray you chide a year together
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo

he's fallen in love with her foulness and she'll fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks I'll sauce her with bitter words Why look you so upon me

for no ill will I bear you

I pray you do not fall in love with me
for I am falser than vows made in wine
besides I like you not If you will know my house
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard
and be not proud though all the world could see
none could be so abus'd in sight as he
come to our flock


dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might
'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight

sweet Phebe

ha what sayst thou Silvius

sweet Phebe pity me

why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius

wherever sorrow is relief would be
if you do sorrow at my grief in love
by giving love your sorrow and my grief

thou hast my love is not that neighbourly

I would have you

why that were covetousness
Silvius the time was that I hated thee
and yet it is not that I bear thee love
but since that thou canst talk of love so well
thy company which erst was irksome to me
I will endure and I'll employ thee too
but do not look for further recompense
than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd

so holy and so perfect is my love
and I in such a poverty of grace
that I shall think it a most plenteous crop
to glean the broken ears after the man
that the main harvest reaps loose now and then

know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile

not very well but I have met him oft
and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
that the old carlot once was master of

think not I love him though I ask for him
'Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
but what care I for words yet words do well
when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
it is a pretty youth not very pretty
but sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him
he'll make a proper man the best thing in him
is his complexion and faster than his tongue
did make offence his eye did heal it up
he is not very tall yet for his years he's tall
his leg is but so so and yet tis well
there was a pretty redness in his lip
than that mix'd in his cheek twas just the difference
betwixt the constant red and mingled damask
there be some women Silvius had they mark'd him
in parcels as I did would have gone near
to fall in love with him but for my part
I love him not nor hate him not and yet
have more cause to hate him than to love him
for what had he to do to chide at me
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black
and now I am remember'd scorn'd at me
I marvel why I answer'd not again
but that's all one omittance is no quittance
I'll write to him a very taunting letter
and thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius

Phebe with all my heart

I'll write it straight
the matter's in my head and in my heart
go with me Silvius

I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee

they say you are a melancholy fellow

I am so I do love it better than laughing

those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards

why tis good to be sad and say nothing

why then tis good to be a post

I have neither the scholar's melancholy which is emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical nor the courtier's which is proud nor the soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor the lover's which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels which by often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness

a traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands

yes I have gained my experience
and your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too


good day and happiness dear Rosalind

nay then God be wi' you an you talk in blank verse


farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more

my fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise

break an hour's promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o' the shoulder but I'll warrant him heart-whole

pardon me dear Rosalind

nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snail

of a snail
ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure I think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him

what's that

why horns that such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife

virtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous

and I am your Rosalind

it pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you

come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind

I would kiss before I spoke

nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking God warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss

how if the kiss be denied
then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter

who could be out being before his beloved mistress

marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit

what of my suit

not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind

I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her

well in her person I say I will not have you

then in mine own person I die

no faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love-cause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot mid-summer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love

I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me
by this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it

then love me Rosalind

yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all

and wilt thou have me

ay and twenty such

what sayest thou

are you not good

I hope so

why then can one desire too much of a good thing Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister

pray thee marry us
I cannot say the words

you must begin Will you Orlando

go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind

I will

ay but when

why now as fast as she can marry us

then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife

I take thee Rosalind for wife

I might ask you for your commission but I do take thee Orlando for my husband there's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions

so do all thoughts they are winged
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her

for ever and a day

say a day without the ever No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new-fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and that when thou art inclined to sleep

but will my Rosalind do so

by my life she will do as I do

O but she is wise

or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the key-hole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney

a man that hath a wife with such a wit he might say Wit whither wilt

nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed

and what wit could wit have to excuse that
marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool

for these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee

alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours

I must attend the duke at dinner by two o'clock I will be with thee again

ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and I thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me tis but one cast away and so come death Two o'clock is your hour

ay sweet Rosalind

by my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will think you the most pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore beware my censure and keep your promise

with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind so adieu

well Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let Time try Adieu



O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of Portugal

or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out

no that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love I'll tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando I'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come

and I'll sleep


which is he that killed the deer

sir it was I

let's present him to the duke like a
Roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purpose

yes sir


what shall he have that kill'd the deer
his leather skin and horns to wear
then sing him home

take thou no scorn to wear the horn
it was a crest ere thou wast born
thy father's father wore it
and thy father bore it
the horn the horn the lusty horn
is not a thing to laugh to scorn


how say you now Is it not past two o'clock And here much Orlando

I warrant you with pure love and a troubled brain he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep Look who comes here


my errand is to you fair youth

I know not the contents but as I guess
by the stern brow and waspish action
which she did use as she was writing of it
it bears an angry tenour pardon me
I am but as a guiltless messenger

patience herself would startle at this letter
and play the swaggerer bear this bear all
she says I am not fair that I lack manners
she calls me proud and that she could not love me
were man as rare as ph nix Od's my will
her love is not the hare that I do hunt
why writes she so to me Well shepherd well
this is a letter of your own device

no I protest I know not the contents
Phebe did write it

and turn'd into the extremity of love
I saw her hand she has a leathern hand
a freestone-colour'd hand I verily did think
that her old gloves were on but twas her hands
she has a housewife's hand but that's no matter
I say she never did invent this letter
this is a man's invention and his hand

sure it is hers

why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
a style for challengers why she defies me
like Turk to Christian woman's gentle brain
could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
such Ethiop words blacker in their effect
than in their countenance Will you hear the letter

so please you for I never heard it yet
yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty
she Phebes me Mark how the tyrant writes

art thou god to shepherd turn'd
that a maiden's heart hath burn'd

can a woman rail thus

call you this railing

why thy godhead laid apart
warr'st thou with a woman's heart

did you ever hear such railing

whiles the eye of man did woo me
that could do no vengeance to me

meaning me a beast

have power to raise such love in mine
alack in me what strange effect
would they work in mild aspect
whiles you chid me I did love
how then might your prayers move
he that brings this love to thee
little knows this love in me
and by him seal up thy mind
whether that thy youth and kind
will the faithful offer take
of me and all that I can make
or else by him my love deny
and then I'll study how to die


call you this chiding

alas poor shepherd


good morrow fair ones Pray you if you know
where in the purlieus of this forest stands
a sheepcote fenc'd about with olive-trees

west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
left on your right hand brings you to the place
but at this hour the house doth keep itself
there's none within

if that an eye may profit by a tongue
then should I know you by description
such garments and such years The boy is fair
of female favour and bestows himself
like a ripe sister but the woman low
and browner than her brother Are not you
the owner of the house I did inquire for


Orlando doth commend him to you both
and to that youth he calls his Rosalind
he sends this bloody napkin Are you he

I am what must we understand by this

some of my shame if you will know of me
what man I am and how and why and where
this handkercher was stain'd

I pray you tell it

when last the young Orlando parted from you
he left a promise to return again
within an hour and pacing through the forest
chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
lo what befell he threw his eye aside
and mark what object did present itself
and high top bald with dry antiquity
a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair
lay sleeping on his back about his neck
a green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself
who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
the opening of his mouth but suddenly
seeing Orlando it unlink'd itself
and with indented glides did slip away
into a bush under which bush's shade
a lioness with udders all drawn dry
lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
when that the sleeping man should stir for tis
the royal disposition of that beast
to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
this seen Orlando did approach the man
and found it was his brother his elder brother

O I have heard him speak of that same brother
and he did render him the most unnatural

and well he might so do
for well I know he was unnatural

but to Orlando did he leave him there
food to the suck'd and hungry lioness

twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so
but kindness nobler ever than revenge
and nature stronger than his just occasion
made him give battle to the lioness
who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
from miserable slumber I awak'd

are you his brother

was it you he rescu'd

was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him
'Twas I but tis not I I do not shame
to tell you what I was since my conversion
so sweetly tastes being the thing I am

but for the bloody napkin

by and by
when from the first to last betwixt us two
tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd
as how I came into that desert place
in brief he led me to the gentle duke
who gave me fresh array and entertainment
committing me unto my brother's love
who led me instantly unto his cave
there stripp'd himself and here upon his arm
the lioness had torn some flesh away
which all this while had bled and now he fainted
and cried in fainting upon Rosalind
brief I recover'd him bound up his wound
he sent me hither stranger as I am
to tell this story that you might excuse
his broken promise and to give this napkin
dy'd in his blood unto the shepherd youth
that he in sport doth call his Rosalind

why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede

many will swoon when they do look on blood

there is more in it Cousin Ganymede

look he recovers

I would I were at home

we'll lead you thither I pray you will you take him by the arm

be of good cheer youth You a man You lack a man's heart
I do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited Heigh-ho

this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest

counterfeit I assure you

well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man

so I do but i' faith I should have been a woman by right

come you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards Good sir go with us

that will I for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother Rosalind

I shall devise something But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him Will you go

we shall find a time Audrey patience gentle Audrey

faith the priest was good enough for all the old gentleman's saying
a most wicked Sir Oliver Audrey a most vile Martext But Audrey there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you

ay I know who tis he hath no interest in me in the world Here comes the man you mean


it is meat and drink to me to see a clown By my troth we that have good wits have much to answer for we shall be flouting we cannot hold

good even Audrey

God ye good even William

and good even to you sir

good even gentle friend Cover thy head cover thy head nay prithee be covered How old are you friend

five-and-twenty sir

a ripe age Is thy name William


a fair name Wast born i' the forest here

ay sir I thank God

'Thank God a good answer Art rich

faith sir so so

'So so is good very good very excellent good and yet it is not it is but so so Art thou wise

ay sir I have a pretty wit

why thou sayest well I do now remember a saying The fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool The heathen philosopher when he had a desire to eat a grape would open his lips when he put it into his mouth meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open You do love this maid

I do sir

give me your hand Art thou learned


then learn this of me to have is to have for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink being poured out of a cup into a glass by filling the one doth empty the other for all your writers do consent that ipse is he now you are not ipse for I am he

which he sir

he sir that must marry this woman Therefore you clown abandon which is in the vulgar leave the society which in the boorish is company of this female which in the common is woman which together is abandon the society of this female or clown thou perishest or to thy better understanding diest or to wit I kill thee make thee away translate thy life into death thy liberty into bondage I will deal in poison with thee or in bastinado or in steel I will bandy with thee in faction I will o'errun thee with policy I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways therefore tremble and depart

do good William

God rest you merry sir

our master and mistress seek you come away away

trip Audrey trip Audrey I attend I attend


is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her that but seeing you should love her and loving woo and wooing she should grant and will you persever to enjoy her

neither call the giddiness of it in question the poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me I love Aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other it shall be to your good for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd
you have my consent Let your wedding be to-morrow thither will I invite the duke and all's contented followers Go you and prepare Aliena for look you here comes my Rosalind


God save you brother

and you fair sister


O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf

it is my arm

I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion

wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady

did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swound when he showed me your handkercher

ay and greater wonders than that
O I know where you are Nay tis true there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and C sar's thrasonical brag of I came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage They are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part them

they shall be married to-morrow and I will bid the duke to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for

why then to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind

I can live no longer by thinking

I will weary you then no longer with idle talking Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me Believe then if you please that I can do strange things I have since I was three years old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes to-morrow human as she is and without any danger

speakest thou in sober meanings

by my life I do which I tender dearly though I say I am a magician Therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married to-morrow you shall and to Rosalind if you will Look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers


youth you have done me much ungentleness
to show the letter that I writ to you

I care not if I have it is my study
you are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd
look upon him love him he worships you

good shepherd tell this youth what tis to love

it is to be all made of sighs and tears
and so am I for Phebe

and I for Ganymede

and I for Rosalind

and I for no woman

it is to be all made of faith and service
and so am I for Phebe

and I for Ganymede


and I for no woman

it is to be all made of fantasy
all made of passion and all made of wishes
all adoration duty and observance
all humbleness all patience and impatience
all purity all trial all obeisance
and so am I for Phebe

and so am I for Ganymede

and so am I for Rosalind

and so am I for no woman

if this be so why blame you me to love you

if this be so why blame you me to love you
if this be so why blame you me to love you

who do you speak to Why blame you me to love you

to her that is not here nor doth not hear

pray you no more of this tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon


as you love Phebe meet and as I love no woman I'll meet So fare you well I have left you commands

I'll not fail if I live

nor I

nor I


to-morrow is the joyful day Audrey to-morrow will we be married
I do desire it with all my heart and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world Here come two of the banished duke's pages


well met honest gentleman

by my troth well met Come sit sit and a song

we are for you sit i' the middle

shall we clap into't roundly without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only prologues to a bad voice

i'faith i'faith and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse

it was a lover and his lass
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
that o'er the green corn-field did pass
in the spring time the only pretty ring time
when birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
sweet lovers love the spring
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
these pretty country folks would lie
in the spring time &c
this carol they began that hour
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
how that a life was but a flower
in the spring time &c
and therefore take the present time
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
for love is crowned with the prime
in the spring time &c

truly young gentlemen though there was no great matter in the ditty yet the note was very untuneable

you are deceived sir we kept time we lost not our time

by my troth yes I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song God be wi' you and God mend your voices Come Audrey


can do all this that he hath promised

I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not
as those that fear they hope and know they fear


patience once more whiles our compact is urg'd


you say if I bring in your Rosalind
you will bestow her on Orlando here

that would I had I kingdoms to give with her

and you say you will have her when I bring her

that would I were I of all kingdoms king

you say that you'll marry me if I be willing
that will I should I die the hour after

but if you do refuse to marry me
you'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd

so is the bargain

you say that you'll have Phebe if she will

though to have her and death were both one thing

I have promis'd to make all this matter even
keep you your word O duke to give your daughter
you yours Orlando to receive his daughter
keep your word Phebe that you'll marry me
or else refusing me to wed this shepherd
keep your word Silvius that you'll marry her
if she refuse me and from hence I go
to make these doubts all even

I do remember in this shepherd boy
some lively touches of my daughter's favour

my lord the first time that I ever saw him
methought he was a brother to your daughter
but my good lord this boy is forest-born
and hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
of many desperate studies by his uncle
whom he reports to be a great magician
obscured in the circle of this forest


there is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to the ark Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools

salutation and greeting to you all

good my lord bid him welcome This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest he hath been a courtier he swears


and how was that ta'en up

faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause

how seventh cause Good my lord like this fellow

I like him very well

God ild you sir I desire you of the like I press in here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks A poor virgin sir an ill-favoured thing sir but mine own a poor humour of mine sir to take that that no man else will Rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster

by my faith he is very swift and sententious

according to the fool's bolt sir and such dulcet diseases

but for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause

upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming Audrey as thus sir I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard he sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was this is called the retort courteous If I sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself this is called the quip modest If again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment this is called the reply churlish If again it was not well cut he would answer I spake not true this is called the reproof valiant if again it was not well cut he would say I lie this is called the countercheck quarrelsome' and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct


I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we measured swords and parted

can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie

O sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners I will name you the degrees The first the retort courteous the second the quip modest the third the reply churlish the fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the countercheck quarrelsome the sixth the lie with circumstance the seventh the lie direct All these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an if I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an if as If you said so then I said so and they shook hands and swore brothers Your if' is the only peace-maker much virtue in if

is not this a rare fellow my lord he's as good at any thing and yet a fool

he uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit


then is there mirth in heaven
when earthly things made even
atone together
good duke receive thy daughter
Hymen from heaven brought her
yea brought her hither
that thou mightst join her hand with his

to you I give myself for I am yours


to you I give myself for I am yours

if there be truth in sight you are my daughter

if there be truth in sight you are my Rosalind

if sight and shape be true
why then my love adieu

I'll have no father if you be not he


I'll have no husband if you be not he




peace ho I bar confusion
'Tis I must make conclusion
of these most strange events
here's eight that must take hands
to join in Hymen's bands
if truth holds true contents


you and you no cross shall part


you and you are heart in heart


you to his love must accord
or have a woman to your lord

you and you are sure together
as the winter to foul weather
whiles a wedlock hymn we sing
feed yourselves with questioning
that reason wonder may diminish
how thus we met and these things finish


wedding is great Juno's crown
O blessed bond of board and bed
'Tis Hymen peoples every town
high wedlock then be honoured
honour high honour and renown
to Hymen god of every town

O my dear niece welcome thou art to me
even daughter welcome in no less degree

I will not eat my word now thou art mine


let me have audience for a word or two
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland
that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
duke Frederick hearing how that every day
men of great worth resorted to this forest
address'd a mighty power which were on foot
in his own conduct purposely to take
his brother here and put him to the sword
and to the skirts of this wild wood he came
where meeting with an old religious man
after some question with him was converted
both from his enterprise and from the world
his crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother
and all their lands restor'd to them again
that were with him exil'd This to be true
I do engage my life

thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding
to one his lands withheld and to the other
a land itself at large a potent dukedom
first in this forest let us do those ends
that here were well begun and well begot
and after every of this happy number
that have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us
shall share the good of our returned fortune
according to the measure of their states
meantime forget this new-fall'n dignity
and fall into our rustic revelry
play music and you brides and bridegrooms all
with measure heap'd in joy to the measures fall

sir by your patience If I heard you rightly
the duke hath put on a religious life
and thrown into neglect the pompous court

he hath
to him will I out of these convertites
there is much matter to be heard and learn'd


you to your former honour I bequeath
your patience and your virtue well deserve it


you to a love that your true faith doth merit


you to your land and love and great allies


you to a long and well-deserved bed


and you to wrangling for thy loving voyage
is but for two months victual'd So to your pleasures

stay Jaques stay

to see no pastime I what you would have
I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave


proceed proceed we will begin these rites
as we do trust they'll end in true delights

it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue If it be true that good wine needs no bush tis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues What a case am I in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play I am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you and I'll begin with the women I charge you O women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and I charge you O men for the love you bear to women as I perceive by your simpering none of you hate them that between you and the women the play may please If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that I defied not and I am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewell

CYMBELINE

you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods
no more obey the heavens than our courtiers
still seem as does the king

but what's the matter
his daughter and the heir of s kingdom whom
he purpos'd to his wife's sole son a widow
that late he married hath referr'd herself
unto a poor but worthy gentleman She's wedded
her husband banish'd she imprison'd all
is outward sorrow though I think the king
be touch'd at very heart

none but the king

he that hath lost her too so is the queen
that most desir'd the match but not a courtier
although they wear their faces to the bent
of the king's looks hath a heart that is not
glad at the thing they scowl at

and why so

he that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
I mean that married her alack good man
and therefore banish'd is a creature such
as to seek through the regions of the earth
for one his like there would be something failing
in him that should compare I do not think
so fair an outward and such stuff within
endows a man but he

you speak him far

I do extend him sir within himself
crush him together rather than unfold
his measure duly

what's his name and birth

I cannot delve him to the root his father
was called Sicilius who did join his honour
against the Romans with Cassibelan
he serv'd with glory and admir'd success
so gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus
and had besides this gentleman in question
two other sons who in the wars o' the time
died with their swords in hand for which their father
then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
that he quit being and his gentle lady
big of this gentleman our theme deceas'd
as he was born The king he takes the babe
to his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus
breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber
puts to him all the learnings that his time
could make him the receiver of which he took
as we do air fast as twas minister'd
and in's spring became a harvest liv'd in court
which rare it is to do most prais'd most lov'd
a sample to the youngest to the more mature
a glass that feated them and to the graver
a child that guided dotards to his mistress
proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue
by her election may be truly read
what kind of man he is

I honour him
even out of your report But pray you tell me
is she sole child to the king

his only child
he had twosons if this be worth your hearing
mark it the eldest of them at three years old
i' the swathing clothes the other from their nursery
were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge
which way they went

how long is this ago

some twenty years

so slackly guarded and the search so slow
that could not trace them

howsoe'er tis strange
or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at
yet is it true sir

I do well believe you

we must forbear Here comes the gentleman
the queen and princess

no be assur'd you shall not find me daughter
after the slander of most step-mothers
evil-ey'd unto you you're my prisoner but
your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
that lock up your restraint For you Posthumus
so soon as I can win the offended king
I will be known your advocate marry yet
you lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
your wisdom may inform you

please your highness
I will from hence to-day

you know the peril
I'll fetch a turn about the garden pitying
the pangs of barr'd affections though the king
hath charg'd you should not speak together


O 
dissembling courtesy How fine this tyrant
can tickle where she wounds My dearest husband
I something fear my father's wrath but nothing
always reserv'd my holy duty what
his rage can do on me You must be gone
and I shall here abide the hourly shot
but that there is this jewel in the world
that I may see again

my queen my mistress
O lady weep no more lest I give cause
to be suspected of more tenderness
than doth become a man I will remain
the loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth
my residence in Rome at one Philario's
who to my father was a friend to me
known but by letter thither write my queen
and with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send
though ink be made of gall


be brief I pray you
if the king come I shall incur I know not
how much of his displeasure

to walk this way I never do him wrong
but he does buy my injuries to be friends
pays dear for my offences


should we be taking leave
as long a term as yet we have to live
the loathness to depart would grow Adieu

nay stay a little
were you but riding forth to air yourself
such parting were too petty Look here love
this diamond was my mother's take it heart
but keep it till you woo another wife
when Imogen is dead

how how another
you gentle gods give me but this I have
and sear up my embracements from a next

while sense can keep it on And sweetest fairest
as I my poor self did exchange for you
to your so infinite loss so in our trifles
I still win of you for my sake wear this
it is a manacle of love I'll place it
upon this fairest prisoner


O the gods
when shall we see again


alack the king

thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight
if after this command thou fraught the court
with thy unworthiness thou diest Away
thou'rt poison to my blood
the gods protect you
and bless the good remainders of the court
I am gone


there cannot be a pinch in death
more sharp than this is

O disloyal thing
that shouldst repair my youth thou heap'st instead
a year's age on me

I beseech you sir
harm not yourself with your vexation
I am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare
subdues all pangs all fears

past grace obedience


that mightst have had the sole son of my queen

O bless'd that I might not I chose an eagle
and did avoid a puttock

thou took'st a beggar wouldst have made my throne
a seat for baseness

no I rather added
a lustre to it

O thou vile one

sir
it is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus
you bred him as my playfellow and he is
a man worth any woman overbuys me
almost the sum he pays
what art thou mad

almost sir heaven restore me Would I were
a neat-herd's daughter and my Leonatus
our neighbour shepherd's son

thou foolish thing


they were again together you have done
not after our command Away with her

and pen her up

beseech your patience Peace
dear lady daughter peace Sweet sovereign
leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort
out of your best advice

a drop of blood a day and being aged
die of this folly


fie you must give way

here is your servant How now sir What news

my lord your son drew on my master

ha
no harm I trust is done

there might have been
but that my master rather play'd than fought
and had no help of anger they were parted
by gentlemen at hand

I am very glad on t
your son's my father's friend he takes his part
to draw upon an exile O brave sir
I would they were in Afric both together
myself by with a needle that I might prick
the goer-back Why came you from your master

on his command he would not suffer me
to bring him to the haven left these notes
of what commands I should be subject to
when t pleas'd you to employ me

this hath been
your faithful servant I dare lay mine honour
he will remain so

I humbly thank your highness

pray walk awhile

I pray you speak with me You shall at least
go see my lord aboard for this time leave me


sir I would advise you to shift a shirt the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice Where air comes out air comes in there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent

if my shirt were bloody them to shift it Have I hurt him

no faith not so much as his patience

hurt him his body's a passable carcass if he be not hurt it is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt

his steel was in debt it went o' the backside the town

the villain would not stand me

no but he fled forward still toward your face

stand you You have land enough of your own but he added to your having gave you some ground
as many inches as you have oceans Puppies

I would they had not come between us

so would I till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground

and that she should love this fellow and refuse me

if it be a sin to make a true election she is damned

sir as I told you always her beauty and her brain go not together she's a good sign but I have seen small reflection of her wit

she shines not upon fools lest the reflection should hurt her

come I'll to my chamber Would there had been some hurt done

I wish not so unless it had been the fall of an ass which is no great hurt

you'll go with us
I'll attend your lordship

nay come let's go together

well my lord


I would thou grew'st unto the shores of the haven
and question'dst every sail if he should write
and I not have it twere a paper lost
as offer'd mercy is What was the last
that he spake to thee

it was his queen his queen

then wav'd his handkerchief

and kiss'd it madam

and that was all

no madam for so long
as he could make me with this eye or ear
distinguish him from others he did keep
the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
still waving as the fits and stirs of s mind
could best express how slow his soul sail'd on
how swift his ship

thou shouldst have made him
as little as a crow or less ere left
to after-eye him

madam so I did

I would have broke mine eye-strings crack'd them but
to look upon him till the diminution
of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
the smallness of a gnat to air and then
have turn'd mine eye and wept But good Pisanio
when shall we hear from him

be assur'd madam
with his next vantage

I did not take my leave of him but had
most pretty things to say ere I could tell him
how I would think on him at certain hours
such thoughts and such or I could make him swear
the shes of Italy should not betray
mine interest and his honour or have charg'd him
at the sixth hour of morn at noon at mid-night
to encounter me with orisons for then
I am in heaven for him or ere I could
give him that parting kiss which I had set
betwixt two charming words comes in my father
and like the tyrannous breathing of the north


the queen madam
desires your highness' company

those things I bid you do get them dispatch'd
I will attend the queen

madam I shall


believe it sir I have seen him in Britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but I could then have looked on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items

you speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within

I have seen him in France we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he

this matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I doubt not a great deal from the matter


ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintance

his father and I were soldiers together to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life Here comes the Briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality

I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing

sir we have known together in Orleans

since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still

sir you o'er-rate my poor kindness I was glad I did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature

by your pardon sir I was then a young traveller rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences but upon my mended judgment if I offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight

faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fallen both

can we with manners ask what was the difference


that lady is not now living or this gentleman's opinion by this worn out

she holds her virtue still and I my mind

you must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy

being so far provoked as I was in France I would abate her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend

as fair and as good a kind of hand-in-hand comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld I could not but believe she excelled many but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady

I praised her as I rated her so do I my stone

what do you esteem it at

more than the world enjoys

either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she's outprized by a trifle


which the gods have given you

which by their graces I will keep

you may wear her in little yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds Your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizeable estimations the one is but frail and the other causal a cunning thief or a that way accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last

your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ring

let us leave here gentlemen

sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first

with five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friend

no no

I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something but I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any lady in the world


what's that

a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserves more a punishment too

gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquainted

would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the approbation of what I have spoke

what lady would you choose to assail

yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved

I will wage against your gold gold to it my ring I hold dear as my finger tis part of it

you are afraid and therein the wiser If you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting But I see you have some religion in you that you fear

this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose I hope


will you I shall but lend my diamond till your return Let there be covenants drawn between s my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to this match Here's my ring

I will have it no lay

by the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if I come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment

I embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand that you have prevailed I am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduced you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword

your hand a covenant We will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for Britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded

agreed


will this hold think you

Signior Iachimo will not from it Pray let us follow em


make haste who has the note of them

I madam

dispatch

now Master doctor have you brought those drugs

pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam

but I beseech your Grace without offence
my conscience bids me ask wherefore you have
commanded of me these most poisonous compounds
which are the movers of a languishing death
but though slow deadly

I wonder doctor
thou ask'st me such a question have I not been
thy pupil long Hast thou not learn'd me how
that our great king himself doth woo me oft
for my confections Having thus far proceeded
unless thou think'st me devilish is t not meet
that I did amplify my judgment in
other conclusions I will try the forces
of these thy compounds on such creatures as
we count not worth the hanging but none human
to try the vigour of them and apply
allayments to their act and by them gather
their several virtues and effects

your highness
shall from this practice but make hard your heart
besides the seeing these effects will be
both noisome and infectious

O content thee


will I first work he's for his master
and enemy to my son How now Pisanio
doctor your service for this time is ended

take your own way

I do suspect you madam
but you shall do no harm

hark thee a word

I do not like her She doth think she has
strange lingering poisons I do know her spirit
and will not trust one of her malice with
a drug of such damn'd nature Those she has
will stupify and dull the sense awhile
which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs
then afterward up higher but there is
no danger in what show of death it makes
to be more fresh reviving She is fool'd
with a most false effect and I the truer
so to be false with her

no further service doctor
until I send for thee

I humbly take my leave


weeps she still sayst thou Dost thou think in time
she will not quench and let instructions enter
where folly now possesses Do thou work
when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
as great as is thy master greater for
his fortunes all lie speechless and his name
is at last gasp return he cannot nor
continue where he is to shift his being
and every day that comes comes to decay
a day's work in him What shalt thou expect
to be depender on a thing that leans
who cannot be new built nor has no friends
so much as but to prop him

thou tak'st up
thou know'st not what but take it for thy labour
it is a thing I made which hath the king
five times redeem'd from death I do not know
what is more cordial nay I prithee take it
it is an earnest of a further good
that I mean to thee Tell thy mistress how
the case stands with her do t as from thyself
think what a chance thou changest on but think
thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
who shall take notice of thee I'll move the king
to any shape of thy preferment such
as thou'lt desire and then myself I chiefly
to load thy merit richly Call my women
think on my words

a sly and constant knave
not to be shak'd the agent for his master
and the remembrancer of her to hold
the hand-fast to her lord I have given him that
which if he take shall quite unpeople her
of leigers for her sweet and which she after
except she bend her humour shall be assur'd
to taste of too


so so well done well done
the violets cowslips and the prime-roses
bear to my closet Fare thee well Pisanio
think on my words

and shall do
I'll choke myself there's all I'll do for you


a father cruel and a step-dame false
a foolish suitor to a wedded lady
that hath her husband banish'd O that husband
my supreme crown of grief and those repeated
vexations of it Had I been thief-stol'n
as my two brothers happy but most miserable
is the desire that's glorious bless'd be those
how mean so'er that have their honest wills
which seasons comfort Who may this be Fie


madam a noble gentleman of Rome
comes from my lord with letters

change you madam
the worthy Leonatus is in safety


thanks good sir
you are kindly welcome

all of her that is out of door most rich
if she be furnish'd with a mind so rare
she is alone the Arabian bird and I
have lost the wager Boldness be my friend
arm me audacity from head to foot
or like the Parthian I shall flying fight
rather directly fly

he is one of the noblest note to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied Reflect upon him accordingly as you value your truest
so far I read aloud
but even the very middle of my heart
is warm'd by the rest and takes it thankfully
you are as welcome worthy sir as I
have words to bid you and shall find it so

thanks fairest lady
what are men mad Hath nature given them eyes
to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
of sea and land which can distinguish twixt
the fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
upon the number'd beach and can we not
partition make with spectacles so precious
'Twixt fair and foul

what makes your admiration

it cannot be i' the eye for apes and monkeys
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
contemn with mows the other nor i' the judgment
for idiots in this case of favour would
be wisely definite nor i' the appetite
sluttery to such neat excellence oppos'd
should make desire vomit emptiness

what is the matter trow

the cloyed will
that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
both fill'd and running ravening first the lamb
longs after for the garbage

what dear sir
thus raps you are you well

thanks madam well


beseech you sir
desire my man's abode where I did leave him
he's strange and peevish

I was going sir


continues well my lord his health beseech you

well madam

is he dispos'd to mirth I hope he is

exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
so merry and so gamesome he is call'd
the Briton reveller

when he was here
he did incline to sadness and oft-times
not knowing why

I never saw him sad
there is a Frenchman his companion one
an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly Briton
your lord I mean laughs from s free lungs cries O
can my sides hold to think that man who knows
by history report or his own proof
what woman is yea what she cannot choose
but must be will his free hours languish for
assured bondage

will my lord say so

ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
it is a recreation to be by
and hear him mock the Frenchman but heavens know
some men are much to blame

not he I hope

not he but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
be us'd more thankfully In himself tis much
whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound
to pity too

what do you pity sir

two creatures heartily

am I one sir
you look on me what wrack discern you in me
deserves your pity

lamentable What
to hide me from the radiant sun and solace
i' the dungeon by a snuff

I pray you sir
deliver with more openness your answers
to my demands Why do you pity me

I was about to say enjoy your But
it is an office of the gods to venge it
not mine to speak on t

you do seem to know
something of me or what concerns me pray you
since doubting things go ill often hurts more
than to be sure they do for certainties
either are past remedies or timely knowing
the remedy then born discover to me
what both you spur and stop

had I this cheek
to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
whose every touch would force the feeler's soul
to the oath of loyalty this object which
takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
firing it only here should I damn'd then
slaver with lips as common as the stairs
made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood as
with labour then by-peeping in an eye
base and illustrous as the smoky light
that's fed with stinking tallow it were fit
that all the plagues of hell should at one time
encounter such revolt

my lord I fear
has forgot Britain

and himself Not I
inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce
the beggary of his change but tis your graces
that from my mutest conscience to my tongue
charms this report out

let me hear no more

O dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
so fair and fasten'd to an empery
would make the great'st king double to be partner'd
with tom-boys hir'd with that self-exhibition
which your own coffers yield with diseas'd ventures
that play with all infirmities for gold
which rottenness can lend nature such boil'd stuff
as well might poison poison Be reveng'd
or she that bore you was no queen and you
recoil from your great stock

reveng'd
how should I be reveng'd If this be true
as I have such a heart that both mine ears
must not in haste abuse if it be true
how should I be reveng'd

should be make me
live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets
whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
more noble than that runagate to your bed
and will continue fast to your affection
still close as sure

what ho Pisanio

let me my service tender on your lips

away I do condemn mine ears that have
so long attended thee If thou wert honourable
thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
for such an end thou seek'st as base as strange
thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
from thy report as thou from honour and
solicit'st here a lady that disdains
thee and the devil alike What ho Pisanio
the king my father shall be made acquainted
of thy assault if he shall think it fit
as in a Romish stew and to expound
his beastly mind to us he hath a court
he little cares for and a daughter who
he not respects at all What ho Pisanio

O happy Leonatus I may say
the credit that thy lady hath of thee
deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
her assur'd credit Blessed live you long
a lady to the worthiest sir that ever
country call'd his and you his mistress only
for the most worthiest fit Give me your pardon
I have spoken this to know if your affiance
were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
that which he is new o'er and he is one
the truest manner'd such a holy witch
that he enchants societies into him
half all men's hearts are his


he sits mongst men like a descended god
he hath a kind of honour sets him off
more than a mortal seeming Be not angry
most mighty princess that I have adventur'd
to try your taking of a false report which hath
honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
in the election of a sir so rare
which you know cannot err The love I bear him
made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
unlike all others chaffless Pray your pardon

all's well sir Take my power i' the court for yours

my humble thanks I had almost forget
to entreat your Grace but in a small request
and yet of moment too for it concerns
your lord myself and other noble friends
are partners in the business
pray what is t

some dozen Romans of us and your lord
the best feather of our wing have mingled sums
to buy a present for the emperor
which I the factor for the rest have done
in France tis plate of rare device and jewels
of rich and exquisite form their values great
and I am something curious being strange
to have them in safe stowage May it please you
to take them in protection

willingly
and pawn mine honour for their safety since
my lord hath interest in them I will keep them
in my bedchamber

they are in a trunk
attended by my men I will make bold
I must aboard to-morrow

O no no

yes I beseech or I shall short my word
by lengthening my return From Gallia
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
to see your Grace

I thank you for your pains
but not away to-morrow

O I must madam
therefore I shall beseech you if you please
to greet your lord with writing do t to-night
I have outstood my time which is material
to the tender of our present

I will write
and truly yielded you You're very welcome

was there ever man had such luck when I kissed the jack upon an up-cast to be hit away I had a hundred pound on t and then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing as if I borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure

what got he by that You have broke his pate with your bowl

if his wit had been like him that broke it it would have run all out

when a gentleman is disposed to swear it is not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths ha

no my lord

nor crop the ears of them

whoreson dog I give him satisfaction
would he had been one of my rank

to have smelt like a fool


you are cock and capon too and you crow cock with your comb on

sayest thou

it is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you give offence to

no I know that but it is fit I should commit offence to my inferiors

ay it is fit for your lordship only

why so I say

did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night

a stranger and I not know on t

he's a strange fellow himself and knows it not


Leonatus a banished rascal and he's another whatsoever he be Who told you of this stranger

one of your lordship's pages

is it fit I went to look upon him Is there no derogation in t

you cannot derogate my lord

not easily I think

you are a fool granted therefore your issues being foolish do not derogate

come I'll go see this Italian What I have lost to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him Come go

I'll attend your lordship

that such a crafty devil as is his mother
should yield the world this ass a woman that
cannot take two from twenty for his heart
and leave eighteen Alas poor princess
thou divine Imogen what thou endur'st
betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd
a mother hourly coining plots a wooer
more hateful than the foul expulsion is
of thy dear husband than that horrid act
of the divorce he'd make The heavens hold firm
the walls of thy dear honour keep unshak'd
that temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand
to enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land


who's there my woman Helen

please you madam

what hour is it


I have read three hours then mine eyes are weak
fold down the leaf where I have left to bed
take not away the taper leave it burning
and if thou canst awake by four o' the clock
I prithee call me Sleep has seized me wholly

to your protection I commend me gods
from fairies and the tempters of the night
guard me beseech ye


the crickets sing and man's o'erlabour'd sense
repairs itself by rest Our Tarquin thus
did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd
the chastity he wounded Cytherea
how bravely thou becom'st thy bed freshlily
and whiter than the sheets That I might touch
but kiss one kiss Rubies unparagon'd
perfumes the chamber thus the flame of the taper
bows toward her and would under-peep her lids
to see the enclosed lights now canopied
under these windows white and azure lac'd
with blue of heaven's own tinct But my design
to note the chamber I will write all down
such and such pictures there the window such
th' adornment of her bed the arras figures
why such and such and the contents o' the story
Ah but some natural notes about her body
above ten thousand meaner moveables
would testify to enrich mine inventory
O sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
and be her senses but as a monument
thus in a chapel lying Come off come off

as slippery as the Gordian knot was hard
'Tis mine and this will witness outwardly
as strongly as the conscience does within
a mole cinque-spotted like the crimson drops
i' the bottom of a cowslip here's a voucher
stronger than ever law could make this secret
will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
the treasure of her honour No more To what end
why should I write this down that's riveted
screw'd to my memory She hath been reading late
the tale of Tereus here the leaf's turn'd down
where Philomel gave up I have enough
to the trunk again and shut the spring of it
swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning
may bare the raven's eye I lodge in fear
though this a heavenly angel hell is here

one two three time time


your lordship is the most patient man in loss the most coldest that ever turned up ace


but not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship You are most hot and furious when you win

winning will put any man into courage
if I could get this foolish Imogen I should have gold enough It's almost morning is t not

day my lord

I would this music would come I am advised to give her music o' mornings they say it will penetrate


come on tune If you can penetrate her with your fingering so we'll try with tongue too if none will do let her remain but I'll never give o'er First a very excellent good-conceited thing after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich words to it and then let her consider


hark hark the lark at heaven's gate sings
and Ph bus gins arise
his steeds to water at those springs
on chalic'd flowers that lies
and winking Mary-buds begin
with every thing that pretty is
my lady sweet arise
arise arise


so get you gone If this penetrate I will consider your music the better if it do not it is a vice in her ears which horse-hairs and calves'-guts nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot can never amend

here comes the king

I am glad I was up so late for that's the reason I was up so early he cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly

good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother

attend you here the door of our stern daughter
will she not forth

I have assail'd her with musics but she vouchsafes no notice

the exile of her minion is too new
must wear the print of his remembrance out
and then she's yours

you are most bound to the king
who lets go by no vantages that may
prefer you to his daughter Frame yourself
to orderly soliciting and be friended
with aptness of the season make denials
increase your services so seem as if
you were inspir'd to do those duties which
you tender to her that you in all obey her
save when command to your dismission tends
and therein you are senseless

senseless not so


so like you sir ambassadors from Rome
the one is Caius Lucius
a worthy fellow
albeit he comes on angry purpose now
but that's no fault of his we must receive him
according to the honour of his sender
and towards himself his goodness forespent on us
we must extend our notice Our dear son
when you have given good morning to your mistress
attend the queen and us we shall have need
to employ you towards this Roman Come our queen


if she be up I'll speak with her if not
let her lie still and dream By your leave ho

I know her women are about her What
if I do line one of their hands Tis gold
which buys admittance oft it doth yea and makes
Diana's rangers false themselves yield up
their deer to the stand o' the stealer and tis gold
nay sometime hangs both thief and true man What
can it not do and undo I will make
one of her women lawyer to me for
I yet not understand the case myself
by your leave

who's there that knocks

a gentleman

no more

yes and a gentlewoman's son

that's more
than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
can justly boast of What's your lordship's pleasure

your lady's person is she ready
ay
to keep her chamber

there's gold for you sell me your good report

how my good name or to report of you
what I shall think is good The princess


good morrow fairest sister your sweet hand


good morrow sir You lay out too much pains
for purchasing but trouble the thanks I give
is telling you that I am poor of thanks
and scarce can spare them

still I swear I love you

if you swear still your recompense is still
that I regard it not

this is no answer

but that you shall not say I yield being silent
I would not speak I pray you spare me faith
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
to your best kindness One of your great knowing
should learn being taught forbearance

to leave you in your madness twere my sin
I will not

fools cure not mad folks

do you call me fool

as I am mad I do
that cures us both I am much sorry sir
you put me to forget a lady's manners
by being so verbal and learn now for all
that I which know my heart do here pronounce
by the very truth of it I care not for you
and am so near the lack of charity
to accuse myself I hate you which I had rather
you felt than make t my boast

you sin against
obedience which you owe your father For
the contract you pretend with that base wretch
one bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes
with scraps o' the court it is no contract none
and though it be allow'd in meaner parties
yet who than he more mean to knit their souls
on whom there is no more dependancy
but brats and beggary in self-figur'd knot
yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
the precious note of it with a base slave
a hilding for a livery a squire's cloth
a pantler not so eminent

profane fellow
wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
but what thou art besides thou wert too base
to be his groom thou wert dignified enough
even to the point of envy if twere made
comparative for your virtues to be styl'd
the under-hangman of his kingdom and hated
for being preferr'd so well

the south-fog rot him

he never can meet more mischance than come
to be but nam'd of thee His meanest garment
that ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer
in my respect than all the hairs above thee


'His garment Now the devil

to Dorothy my woman hie thee presently

'His garment

I am sprighted with a fool
frighted and anger'd worse Go bid my woman
search for a jewel that too casually
hath left mine arm it was thy master's shrew me
if I would lose it for a revenue
of any king's in Europe I do think
I saw t this morning confident I am
last night twas on mine arm I kiss'd it
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
that I kiss aught but he


I hope so go and search


you have abus'd me
'His meanest garment

ay I said so sir
if you will make t an action call witness to t

I will inform your father

your mother too
she's my good lady and will conceive I hope
but the worst of me So I leave you sir
to the worst of discontent


I'll be reveng'd


fear it not sir I would I were so sure
to win the king as I am bold her honour
will remain hers

what means do you make to him

not any but abide the change of time
quake in the present winter's state and wish
that warmer days would come in these sear'd hopes
I barely gratify your love they failing
I must die much your debtor

your very goodness and your company
o'erpays all I can do By this your king
hath heard of great Augustus Caius Lucius
will do s commission throughly and I think
he'll grant the tribute send the arrearages
is yet fresh in their grief

I do believe
statist though I am none nor like to be
that this will prove a war and you shall hear
the legions now in Gallia sooner landed
in our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen
are men more order'd than when Julius C sar
smil'd at their lack of skill but found their courage
worthy his frowning at their discipline
now winged with their courage will make known
to their approvers they are people such
that mend upon the world

see Iachimo


the swiftest harts have posted you by land
to make your vessel nimble

welcome sir

I hope the briefness of your answer made
the speediness of your return

your lady
is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon

and therewithal the best or let her beauty
look through a casement to allure false hearts
and be false with them

here are letters for you

their tenour good I trust

'Tis very like
was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
when you were there

he was expected then
but not approach'd

all is well yet
sparkles this stone as it was wont or is't not
too dull for your good wearing

if I have lost it
I should have lost the worth of it in gold
I'll make a journey twice as far to enjoy
a second night of such sweet shortness which
was mine in Britain for the ring is won

the stone's too hard to come by

not a whit

make not sir
your loss your sport I hope you know that we
must not continue friends

good sir we must
if you keep covenant Had I not brought
the knowledge of your mistress home I grant
we were to question further but I now
profess myself the winner of her honour
together with your ring and not the wronger
of her or you having proceeded but
by both your wills

if you can make t apparent
that you have tasted her in bed my hand
and ring is yours if not the foul opinion
you had of her pure honour gains or loses
your sword or mine or masterless leaves both

sir my circumstances
being so near the truth as I will make them
must first induce you to believe whose strength
I will confirm with oath which I doubt not
you'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
you need it not

proceed

first her bedchamber
where I confess I slept not but profess
had that was well worth watching it was hang'd
with tapestry of silk and silver the story
proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
and Cydnus swell'd above the banks or for
the press of boats or pride a piece of work
so bravely done so rich that it did strive
in workmanship and value which I wonder'd
since the true life on t was

this is true
and this you might have heard of here by me
or by some other

more particulars
must justify my knowledge

so they must
or do your honour injury

the chimney
is south the chamber and the chimney-piece
chaste Dian bathing never saw I figures
so likely to report themselves the cutter
was as another nature dumb outwent her
motion and breath left out

which you might from relation likewise reap
being as it is much spoke of

the roof o' the chamber
with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons
I had forgot them were two winking Cupids
of silver each on one foot standing nicely
depending on their brands

this is her honour
let it be granted you have seen all this and praise
be given to your remembrance the description
of what is in her chamber nothing saves
the wager you have laid

then if you can
be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel see

and now tis up again it must be married

Jove
once more let me behold it Is it that
which I left with her

sir I thank her that
she stripp'd it from her arm I see her yet
her pretty action did outsell her gift
and yet enrich'd it too She gave it me and said
she priz'd it once

may be she pluck'd it off
to send it me

she writes so to you doth she

O no no no tis true Here take this too

it is a basilisk unto mine eye
where there is beauty truth where semblance love
where there's another man the vows of women
of no more bondage be to where they are made
than they are to their virtues which is nothing
O above measure false

have patience sir
and take your ring again tis not yet won
it may be probable she lost it or
who knows if one of her women being corrupted
hath stol'n it from her

very true
and so I hope he came by t Back my ring
render to me some corporal sign about her
more evident than this for this was stol'n

by Jupiter I had it from her arm

'Tis true nay keep the ring tis true I am sure
she would not lose it her attendants are
all sworn and honourable they induc'd to steal it
and by a stranger No he hath enjoy'd her
the cognizance of her incontinency
is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly
there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
divide themselves between you

sir be patient
this is not strong enough to be believ'd
of one persuaded well of

never talk on t
she hath been colted by him

if you seek
for further satisfying under her breast
worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud
I kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger
to feed again though full You do remember
this stain upon her

ay and it doth confirm
another stain as big as hell can hold
were there no more but it

will you hear more

spare your arithmetic never count the turns
once and a million

I'll be sworn

no swearing
if you will swear you have not done t you lie
and I will kill thee if thou dost deny
thou'st made me cuckold
I'll deny nothing

O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal
I will go there and do t i' the court before
her father I'll do something


quite besides
the government of patience You have won
let's follow him and pervert the present wrath
he hath against himself

with all my heart


is there no way for men to be but women
must be half-workers We are all bastards all
and that most venerable man which I
did call my father was I know not where
made me a counterfeit yet my mother seem'd
the Dian of that time so doth my wife
the nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance
me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
and pray'd me oft forbearance did it with
a pudency so rosy the sweet view on t
might well have warm'd old Saturn that I thought her
as chaste as unsunn'd snow O all the devils
this yellow Iachimo in an hour was t not
or less at first perchance he spoke not but
like a full-acorn'd boar a German one
cried O and mounted found no opposition
but what he look'd for should oppose and she
should from encounter guard Could I find out
the woman's part in me For there's no motion
that tends to vice in man but I affirm
it is the woman's part be it lying note it
the woman's flattering hers deceiving hers
lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
nice longing slanders mutability
all faults that man may name nay that hell knows
why hers in part or all but rather all
for even to vice
they are not constant but are changing still
one vice but of a minute old for one
not half so old as that I'll write against them
detest them curse them Yet tis greater skill
in a true hate to pray they have their will
the very devils cannot plague them better

now say what would Augustus C sar with us

when Julius C sar whose remembrance yet
lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
be theme and hearing ever was in this Britain
and conquer'd it Cassibelan thine uncle
famous in C sar's praises no whit less
than in his feats deserving it for him
yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
is left untender'd

and to kill the marvel
shall be so ever

there be many C sars
ere such another Julius Britain is
a world by itself and we will nothing pay
for wearing our own noses

that opportunity
which then they had to take from s to resume
we have again Remember sir my liege
the kings your ancestors together with
the natural bravery of your isle which stands
as Neptune's park ribbed and paled in
with rocks unscaleable and roaring waters
with sands that will not bear your enemies' boats
C sar made here but made not here his brag
of came and saw and overcame with shame
the first that ever touch'd him he was carried
from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping
poor ignorant baubles on our terrible seas
like egg-shells mov'd upon their surges crack'd
as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof
the fam'd Cassibelan who was once at point
O giglot fortune to master C sar's sword
made Lud's town with rejoicing-fires bright
and Britons stiut with courage

come there's no more tribute to be paid Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as I said there is no moe such C sars other of them may have crooked noses but to owe such straight arms none

son let your mother end

we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan I do not say I am one but I have a hand Why tribute why should we pay tribute If C sar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now

you must know
this tribute from us we were free C sar's ambition
which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
the sides o' the world against all colour here
did put the yoke upon s which to shake off
becomes a war-like people whom we reckon
ourselves to be We do say then to C sar
our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of C sar
hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
shall by the power we hold be our good deed
though Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our laws
who was the first of Britain which did put
his brows within a golden crown and call'd
himself a king

I am sorry Cymbeline
that I am to pronounce Augustus C sar
C sar that hath more kings his servants than
thyself domestic officers thine enemy
in C sar's name pronounce I gainst thee look
for fury not to be resisted Thus defied
I thank thee for myself

thou art welcome Caius
thy C sar knighted me my youth I spent
much under him of him I gather'd honour
which he to seek of me again perforce
behoves me keep at utterance I am perfect
that the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
their liberties are now in arms a precedent
which not to read would show the Britons cold
so C sar shall not find them

let proof speak

his majesty bids you welcome Make pastime with us a day or two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our salt-water girdle if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and there's an end

so sir
I know your master's pleasure and he mine
all the remain is Welcome


how of adultery Wherefore write you not
what monster's her accuser Leonatus
O master what a strange infection
is fall'n into thy ear What false Italian
as poisonous-tongu'd as handed hath prevail'd
on thy too ready hearing Disloyal No
she's punish'd for her truth and undergoes
more goddess-like than wife-like such assaults
as would take in some virtue O my master
thy mind to her is now as low as were
thy fortunes How that I should murder her
upon the love and truth and vows which I
have made to thy command I her her blood
if it be so to do good service never
let me be counted serviceable How look I
so much as this fact comes to Do't the letter
that I have sent her by her own command
shall give thee opportunity O damn'd paper
black as the ink that's on thee Senseless bauble
art thou a feodary for this act and look'st
so virgin-like without Lo here she comes
I am ignorant in what I am commanded


how now Pisanio

madam here is a letter from my lord

who thy lord that is my lord Leonatus
O learn'd indeed were that astronomer
that knew the stars as I his characters
he'd lay the future open You good gods
let what is here contain'd relish of love
of my lord's health of his content yet not
some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them
for it doth physic love of his content
all but in that Good wax thy leave Bless'd be
you bees that make these locks of counsel Lovers
and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike
though forfeiters you cast in prison yet
you clasp young Cupid's tables Good news gods
justice and your father's wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you O the dearest of creatures would not even renew me with your eyes Take notice that I am in Cambria at Milford-Haven what your own love will out of this advise you follow So he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love
O for a horse with wings Hear'st thou Pisanio
he is at Milford-Haven read and tell me
how far tis thither If one of mean affairs
may plod it in a week why may not I
glide thither in a day Then true Pisanio
who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st
O let me bate but not like me yet long'st
but in a fainter kind O not like me
for mine's beyond beyond say and speak thick
love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
to the smothering of the sense how far it is
tell me how Wales was made so happy as
t' inherit such a haven but first of all
how we may steal from hence and for the gap
that we shall make in time from our hencegoing
and our return to excuse but first how get hence
why should excuse be born or ere begot
we'll talk of that hereafter Prithee speak
how many score of miles may we well ride
'Twixt hour and hour

one score twixt sun and sun
madam s enough for you and too much too

why one that rode to s execution man
could never go so slow I have heard of riding wagers
where horses have been nimbler than the sands
that run i' the clock's behalf But this is foolery
go bid my woman feign a sickness say
she'll home to her father and provide me presently
a franklin's housewife

madam you're best consider

I see before me man nor here nor here
nor what ensues but have a fog in them
that I cannot look through Away I prithee
do as I bid thee There's no more to say
accessible is none but Milford way


a goodly day not to keep house with such
whose roof's as low as ours Stoop boys this gate
instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
to a morning's holy office the gates of monarchs
are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
and keep their impious turbans on without
good morrow to the sun Hail thou fair heaven
we house i' the rock yet use thee not so hardly

hail heaven

hail heaven

now for our mountain sport Up to yond hill
your legs are young I'll tread these flats Consider
when you above perceive me like a crow
that it is place which lessens and sets off
and you may then revolve what tales I have told you
of courts of princes of the tricks in war
this service is not service so being done
but being so allow'd to apprehend thus
draws us a profit from all things we see
and often to our comfort shall we find
the sharded beetle in a safer hold
than is the full wing'd eagle O this life
is nobler than attending for a check
richer than doing nothing for a bribe
such gain the cap of him that makes em fine
yet keeps his book uncross'd no life to ours

out of your proof you speak we poor unfledg'd
have never wing'd from view o' the nest nor know not
what air's from home Haply this life is best
if quiet life be best sweeter to you
that have a sharper known well corresponding
with your stiff age but unto us it is
a cell of ignorance travelling a-bed
a prison for a debtor that not dares
to stride a limit

what should we speak of
when we are old as you when we shall hear
the rain and wind beat dark December how
in this our pinching cave shall we discourse
the freezing hours away We have seen nothing
we are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
our valour is to chase what flies our cage
we make a quire as doth the prison'd bird
and sing our bondage freely

how you speak
did you but know the city's usuries
and felt them knowingly the art o' the court
as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
is certain falling or so slippery that
the fear's as bad as falling the toil of the war
a pain that only seems to seek out danger
i' the name of fame and honour which dies i' the search
and hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
as record of fair act nay many times
doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse
must curtsy at the censure O boys this story
the world may read in me my body's mark'd
with Roman swords and my report was once
first with the best of note Cymbeline lov'd me
was not far off then was I as a tree
whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
a storm or robbery call it what you will
shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
and left me bare to weather

uncertain favour

my fault being nothing as I have told you oft
but that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd
before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans so
follow'd my banishment and this twenty years
this rock and these demesnes have been my world
where I have liv'd at honest freedom paid
more pious debts to heaven than in all
the fore-end of my time But up to the mountains
this is not hunter's language He that strikes
the venison first shall be the lord o' the feast
and we will fear no poison which attends
in place of greater state I'll meet you in the valleys

how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
these boys know little they are sons to the king
nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive
they think they are mine and though train'd up thus meanly
i' the cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit
the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
in simple and low things to prince it much
beyond the trick of others This Polydore
the heir of Cymbeline and Britain who
the king his father call'd Guiderius Jove
when on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
the war-like feats I have done his spirits fly out
into my story say Thus mine enemy fell
and thus I set my foot on s neck even then
the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
once Arviragus in as like a figure
strikes life into my speech and shows much more
his own conceiving Hark the game is rous'd
O Cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
thou didst unjustly banish me whereon
at three and two years old I stole these babes
thinking to bar thee of succession as
thou reft'st me of my lands Euriphile
thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother
and every day do honour to her grave
myself Belarius that am Morgan call'd
they take for natural father The game is up


thou told'st me when we came from horse the place
was near at hand ne'er long'd my mother so
to see me first as I have now Pisanio man
where is Posthumus What is in thy mind
that makes thee stare thus Wherefore breaks that sigh
would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
beyond self-explication put thyself
into a haviour of less fear ere wildness
vanquish my staider senses What's the matter
why tender'st thou that paper to me with
a look untender If t be summer news
smile to t before if winterly thou need'st
but keep that count'nance still My husband's hand
that drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him
and he's at some hard point Speak man thy tongue
may take off some extremity which to read
would be even mortal to me

please you read
and you shall find me wretched man a thing
the most disdain'd of fortune

thy mistress Pisanio hath played the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me I speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge That part thou Pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers Let thine own hands take away her life I shall give thee opportunity at Milford-Haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal

hath cut her throat already No tis slander
whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
outvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breath
rides on the posting winds and doth belie
all corners of the world kings queens and states
maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
this viperous slander enters What cheer madam

false to his bed What is it to be false
to lie in watch there and to think on him
to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature
to break it with a fearful dream of him
and cry myself awake that's false to s bed is it

alas good lady

I false Thy conscience witness Iachimo
thou didst accuse him of incontinency
thou then look'dst like a villain now methinks
whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him
poor I am stale a garment out of fashion
and for I am richer than to hang by the walls
I must be ripp'd to pieces with me O
men's vows are women's traitors All good seeming
by thy revolt O husband shall be thought
put on for villany not born where t grows
but worn a bait for ladies

good madam hear me

true honest men being heard like false neas
were in his time thought false and Sinon's weeping
did scandal many a holy tear took pity
from most true wretchedness so thou Posthumus
wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd
from thy great fail Come fellow be thou honest
do thou thy master's bidding When thou seest him
I draw the sword myself take it and hit
the innocent mansion of my love my heart
fear not tis empty of all things but grief
thy master is not there who was indeed
the riches of it do his bidding strike
thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
but now thou seem'st a coward

hence vile instrument
thou shalt not damn my hand

why I must die
and if I do not by thy hand thou art
no servant of thy master's Against self-slaughter
there is a prohibition so divine
that cravens my weak hand Come here's my heart
something's afore t soft soft we'll no defence
obedient as the scabbard What is here
the scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
corrupters of my faith you shall no more
be stomachers to my heart Thus may poor fools
believe false teachers though those that are betray'd
do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
stands in worse case of woe
and thou Posthumus thou that didst set up
my disobedience gainst the king my father
and make me put into contempt the suits
of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
it is no act of common passage but
a strain of rareness and I grieve myself
to think when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
that now thou tir'st on how thy memory
will then be pang'd by me Prithee dispatch
the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife
thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
when I desire it too

O gracious lady
I have not slept one wink

do t and to bed then

I'll wake mine eyeballs blind first

wherefore then
didst undertake it Why hast thou abus'd
so many miles with a pretence this place
mine action and thine own our horses' labour
the time inviting thee the perturb'd court
for my being absent whereunto I never
purpose return Why hast thou gone so far
to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand
the elected deer before thee

but to win time
to lose so bad employment in the which
I have consider'd of a course Good lady

talk thy tongue weary speak
I have heard I am a strumpet and mine ear
therein false struck can take no greater wound
nor tent to bottom that But speak

then madam
I thought you would not back again

most like
bringing me here to kill me

not so neither
but if I were as wise as honest then
my purpose would prove well It cannot be
but that my master is abus'd some villain
some villain ay and singular in his art
hath done you both this cursed injury


no on my life
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
some bloody sign of it for tis commanded
I should do so you shall be miss'd at court
and that will well confirm it

why good fellow
what shall I do the while where bide how live
or in my life what comfort when I am
dead to my husband

if you'll back to the court

no court no father nor no more ado
with that harsh noble simple nothing Cloten
that Cloten whose love-suit hath been to me
as fearful as a siege

then not in Britain must you bide

where then
hath Britain all the sun that shines Day night
are they not but in Britain I' the world's volume
our Britain seems as of it but not in t
in a great pool a swan's nest prithee think
there's livers out of Britain

I am most glad
you think of other place The ambassador
Lucius the Roman comes to Milford-Haven
to-morrow now if you could wear a mind
dark as your fortune is and but disguise
that which t' appear itself must not yet be
but by self-danger you should tread a course
pretty and full of view yea haply near
the residence of Posthumus so nigh at least
that though his actions were not visible yet
as truly as he moves

O for such means
though peril to my modesty not death on t
I would adventure

well then here's the point
you must forget to be a woman change
command into obedience fear and niceness
the handmaids of all women or more truly
woman it pretty self into a waggish courage
ready in gibes quick-answer'd saucy and
as quarrelous as the weasel nay you must
forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
exposing it but O the harder heart
alack no remedy to the greedy touch
of common-kissing Titan and forget
your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
you made great Juno angry
nay be brief
I see into thy end and am almost
a man already

first make yourself but like one
forethinking this I have already fit
'Tis in my cloak-bag doublet hat hose all
that answer to them would you in their serving
and with what imitation you can borrow
from youth of such a season fore noble Lucius
present yourself desire his service tell him
wherein you are happy which you'll make him know
if that his head have ear in music doubtless
with joy he will embrace you for he's honourable
and doubling that most holy Your means abroad
you have me rich and I will never fail
beginning nor supplyment

thou art all the comfort
there's more to be consider'd but we'll even
all that good time will give us this attempt
I'm soldier to and will abide it with
a prince's courage Away I prithee

well madam we must take a short farewell
lest being miss'd I be suspected of
your carriage from the court My noble mistress
here is a box I had it from the queen
what's in t is precious if you are sick at sea
or stomach-qualm'd at land a dram of this
will drive away distemper To some shade
and fit you to your manhood May the gods
direct you to the best

amen I thank thee


thus far and so farewell
thanks royal sir
my emperor hath wrote I must from hence
and am right sorry that I must report ye
my master's enemy

our subjects sir
will not endure his yoke and for ourself
to show less sovereignty than they must needs
appear unking-like

so sir I desire of you
a conduct over land to Milford-Haven
madam all joy befall your Grace

and you

my lords you are appointed for that office
the due of honour in no point omit
so farewell noble Lucius
your hand my lord

receive it friendly but from this time forth
I wear it as your enemy

sir the event
is yet to name the winner Fare you well

leave not the worthy Lucius good my lords
till he have cross'd the Severn Happiness


he goes hence frowning but it honours us
that we have given him cause

'Tis all the better
your valiant Britons have their wishes in it

Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
our chariots and horsemen be in readiness
the powers that he already hath in Gallia
will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves
his war for Britain

'Tis not sleepy business
but must be look'd to speedily and strongly

our expectation that it would be thus
hath made us forward But my gentle queen
where is our daughter She hath not appear'd
before the Roman nor to us hath tender'd
the duty of the day she looks us like
a thing more made of malice than of duty
we have noted it Call her before us for
we have been too slight in sufferance


royal sir
hath her life been the cure whereof my lord
'Tis time must do Beseech your majesty
forbear sharp speeches to her she's a lady
so tender of rebukes that words are strokes
and strokes death to her


where is she sir How
can her contempt be answer'd

please you sir
her chambers are all lock'd and there's no answer
that will be given to the loudest noise we make

my lord when last I went to visit her
she pray'd me to excuse her keeping close
whereto constrain'd by her infirmity
she should that duty leave unpaid to you
which daily she was bound to proffer this
made me to blame in memory

her doors lock'd
not seen of late Grant heavens that which I fear
prove false


son I say follow the king

that man of hers Pisanio her old servant
I have not seen these two days

go look after

Pisanio thou that stand'st so for Posthumus
he hath a drug of mine I pray his absence
proceed by swallowing that for he believes
it is a thing most precious But for her
where is she gone Haply despair hath sciz'd her
to her desir'd Posthumus Gone she is
to death or to dishonour and my end
can make good use of either she being down
I have the placing of the British crown

how now my son

'Tis certain she is fled
go in and cheer the king he rages none
dare come about him

all the better may
this night forestall him of the coming day


I love and hate her for she's fair and royal
and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
than lady ladies woman from every one
the best she hath and she of all compounded
disdaining me and throwing favours on
the low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
that what's else rare is chok'd and in that point
I will conclude to hate her nay indeed
to be reveng'd upon her For when fools
shall


who is here What are you packing sirrah
come hither Ah you precious pandar Villain
where is thy lady In a word or else

thou art straightway with the fiends

O good my lord

where is thy lady or by Jupiter
I will not ask again Close villain
I'll have this secret from thy heart or rip
from whose so many weights of baseness cannot
a dram of worth be drawn

alas my lord
how can she be with him When was she miss'd
he is in Rome

where is she sir Come nearer
no further halting satisfy me home
what is become of her

O my all-worthy lord

all-worthy villain
discover where thy mistress is at once
at the next word no more of worthy lord
speak or thy silence on the instant is
thy condemnation and thy death

this paper is the history of my knowledge
touching her flight


let's see t I will pursue her
even to Augustus' throne

or this or perish
she's far enough and what he learns by this
may prove his travel not her danger

hum

I'll write to my lord she's dead O Imogen
safe mayst thou wander safe return agen

sirrah is this letter true

sir as I think
it is Posthumus' hand I know t Sirrah if thou wouldst not be a villain but do me true service undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry that is what villany soe'er I bid thee do to perform it directly and truly I would think thee an honest man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment

well my good lord

wilt thou serve me For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus thou canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of mine Wilt thou serve me

sir I will

give me thy hand here's my purse Hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession

I have my lord at my lodging the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress

the first service thou dost me fetch that suit hither let it be thy first service go

I shall my lord


meet thee at Milford-Haven I forgot to ask him one thing I'll remember t anon even there thou villain Posthumus will I kill thee I would these garments were come She said upon a time the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities With that suit upon my back will I ravish her first kill him and in her eyes there shall she see my valour which will then be a torment to her contempt He on the ground my speech of insultment ended on his dead body and when my lust hath dined which as I say to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so praised to the court I'll knock her back foot her home again She hath despised me rejoicingly and I'll be merry in my revenge


ay my noble lord

how long is t since she went to Milford-Haven

she can scarce be there yet

bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second thing that I have commanded thee the third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design Be but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself to thee My revenge is now at Milford would I had wings to follow it
come and be true


thou bidd'st me to my loss for true to thee
were to prove false which I will never be
to him that is most true To Milford go
and find not her whom thou pursu'st Flow flow
you heavenly blessings on her This fool's speed
be cross'd with slowness labour be his meed


I have tir'd myself and for two nights together
have made the ground my bed I should be sick
but that my resolution helps me Milford
when from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee
thou wast within a ken O Jove I think
foundations fly the wretched such I mean
where they should be reliev'd Two beggars told me
I could not miss my way will poor folks lie
that have afflictions on them knowing tis
a punishment or trial Yes no wonder
when rich ones scarce tell true To lapse in fulness
is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood
is worse in kings than beggars My dear lord
thou art one o' the false ones Now I think on thee
my hunger's gone but even before I was
at point to sink for food But what is this
here is a path to t tis some savage hold
I were best not call I dare not call yet famine
ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant
of hardiness is mother Ho Who's here
if any thing that's civil speak if savage
take or lend Ho No answer Then I'll enter
best draw my sword and if mine enemy
but fear the sword like me he'll scarcely look on t
such a foe good heavens

you Polydore have prov'd best woodman and
are master of the feast Cadwal and I
will play the cook and servant tis our match
the sweat of industry would dry and die
but for the end it works to Come our stomachs
will make what's homely savoury weariness
can snore upon the flint when resty sloth
finds the down pillow hard Now peace be here
poor house that keep'st thyself

I am throughly weary


there is cold meat i' the cave we'll browse on that
whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd

stay come not in
but that it eats our victuals I should think
here were a fairy

what's the matter sir

by Jupiter an angel or if not
an earthly paragon Behold divineness
no elder than a boy


good masters harm me not
before I enter'd here I call'd and thought
to have begg'd or bought what I have took Good troth
I have stol'n nought nor would not though I had found
I would have left it on the board so soon
as I had made my meal and parted
with prayers for the provider

money youth

all gold and silver rather turn to dirt
as tis no better reckon'd but of those
who worship dirty gods

I see you're angry
know if you kill me for my fault I should
have died had I not made it

whither bound

to Milford-Haven

what's your name
Fidele sir I have a kinsman who
is bound for Italy he embark'd at Milford
to whom being going almost spent with hunger
I am fall'n in this offence

prithee fair youth
think us no churis nor measure our good minds
by this rude place we live in Well encounter'd
'Tis almost night you shall have better cheer
ere you depart and thanks to stay and eat it
boys bid him welcome

were you a woman youth
I should woo hard but be your groom In honesty
I bid for you as I do buy

I'll make t my comfort
he is a man I'll love him as my brother
and such a welcome as I'd give to him
be sprightly for you fall mongst friends

'Mongst friends
if brothers

would it had been so that they
had been my father's sons then had my prize
been less and so more equal ballasting
to thee Posthumus

he wrings at some distress

would I could free t

or I whate'er it be
what pain it cost what danger Gods

hark boys

great men
that had a court no bigger than this cave
that did attend themselves and had the virtue
which their own conscience seal'd them laying by
that nothing-gift of differing multitudes
could not out-peer these twain Pardon me gods
I'd change my sex to be companion with them
since Leonatus' false

it shall be so
boys we'll go dress our hunt Fair youth come in
discourse is heavy fasting when we have supp'd
we'll mannerly demand thee of thy story
so far as thou wilt speak it

pray draw near

the night to the owl and morn to the lark less welcome


I pray draw near


this is the tenour of the emperor's writ
that since the common men are now in action
'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians
and that the legions now in Gallia are
full weak to undertake our wars against
the fall'n-off Britons that we do incite
the gentry to this business He creates
Lucius pro-consul and to you the tribunes
for this immediate levy he commends
his absolute commission Long live C sar

is Lucius general of the forces

ay


with those legions
which I have spoke of whereunto your levy
must be supplyant the words of your commission
will tie you to the numbers and the time
of their dispatch

we will discharge our duty

I am near to the place where they should meet if Pisanio have mapped it truly How fit his garments serve me Why should his mistress who was made by him that made the tailor not be fit too the rather saving reverence of the word for tis said a woman's fitness comes by fits Therein I must play the workman I dare speak it to myself for it is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber I mean the lines of my body are as well drawn as his no less young more strong not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the advantage of the time above him in birth alike conversant in general services and more remarkable in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite What mortality is Posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy shoulders shall within this hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before thy face and all this done spurn her home to her father who may haply be a little angry for my so rough usage but my mother having power of his testiness shall turn all into my commendations My horse is tied up safe out sword and to a sore purpose Fortune put them into my hand This is the very description of their meeting-place and the fellow dares not deceive me


you are not well remain here in the cave
we'll come to you after hunting

brother stay here
are we not brothers

so man and man should be
whose dust is both alike I am very sick

go you to hunting I'll abide with him

so sick I am not yet I am not well
but not so citizen a wanton as
to seem to die ere sick So please you leave me
stick to your journal course the breach of custom
is breach of all I am ill but your being by me
cannot amend me society is no comfort
to one not sociable I am not very sick
since I can reason of it pray you trust me here
I'll rob none but myself and let me die
stealing so poorly

I love thee I have spoke it
how much the quantity the weight as much
as I do love my father


if it be sin to say so sir I yoke me
in my good brother's fault I know not why
I love this youth and I have heard you say
love's reason's without reason the bier at door
and a demand who is t shall die I'd say
'My father not this youth

O noble strain
O worthiness of nature breed of greatness
cowards father cowards and base things sire base
nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace
I'm not their father yet who this should be
doth miracle itself lov'd before me
'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn

brother farewell

I wish ye sport
you health So please you sir

these are kind creatures Gods what lies I have heard
our courtiers say all's savage but at court
experience O thou disprov'st report
the imperious seas breed monsters for the dish
poor tributary rivers as sweet fish
I am sick still heart-sick Pisanio
I'll now taste of thy drug


I could not stir him
he said he was gentle but unfortunate
dishonestly afflicted but yet honest

thus did he answer me yet said hereafter
I might know more

to the field to the field

we'll leave you for this time go in and rest

we'll not be long away

pray be not sick
for you must be our housewife

well or ill
I am bound to you

and shalt be ever

this youth howe'er distress'd appears he hath had
good ancestors

how angel-like he sings

but his neat cookery he cut our roots
and sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick
and he her dieter

nobly he yokes
a smiling with a sigh as if the sigh
was that it was for not being such a smile
the smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
from so divine a temple to commix
with winds that sailors rail at

I do note
that grief and patience rooted in him both
mingle their spurs together

grow patience
and let the stinking-elder grief untwine
his perishing root with the increasing vine

it is great morning Come away Who's there

I cannot find those runagates that villain
hath mock'd me I am faint

'Those runagates
means he not us I partly know him tis
Cloten the son o' the queen I fear some ambush
I saw him not these many years and yet
I know tis he We are held as outlaws hence

he is but one You and my brother search
what companies are near pray you away
let me alone with him


soft What are you
that fly me thus some villain mountainers
I have heard of such What slave art thou

more slavish did I ne'er than answering
a slave' without a knock

thou art a robber
a law-breaker a villain Yield thee thief

to who to thee What art thou Have not I
an arm as big as thine a heart as big
thy words I grant are bigger for I wear not
my dagger in my mouth Say what thou art
why I should yield to thee

thou villain base
know'st me not by my clothes

no nor thy tailor rascal
who is thy grandfather he made those clothes
which as it seems make thee

my tailor made them not

hence then and thank
the man that gave them thee Thou art some fool
I am loath to beat thee

thou injurious thief
hear but my name and tremble

what's thy name

Cloten thou villain

Cloten thou double villain be thy name
I cannot tremble at it were it Toad or Adder Spider
'Twould move me sooner

to thy further fear
nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know

I'm sorry for t not seeming
so worthy as thy birth

art not afeard

those that I reverence those I fear the wise
at fools I laugh not fear them

die the death
when I have slain thee with my proper hand
I'll follow those that even now fled hence
and on the gates of Lud's town set your heads
yield rustic mountaineer

no companies abroad

none in the world You did mistake him sure

but time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
which then he wore the snatches in his voice
and burst of speaking were as his I am absolute
'Twas very Cloten

in this place we left them
I wish my brother make good time with him
you say he is so fell

being scarce made up
I mean to man he had not apprehension
of roaring terrors for defect of judgment
is oft the cease of fear But see thy brother


this Cloten was a fool an empty purse
there was no money in t Not Hercules
could have knock'd out his brains for he had none
yet I not doing this the fool had borne

what hast thou done

I am perfect what cut off one Cloten's head
son to the queen after his own report
who call'd me traitor mountaineer and swore
with his own single hand he'd take us in
displace our heads where thank the gods they grow
and set them on Lud's town

we are all undone

why worthy father what have we to lose
but that he swore to take our lives The law
protects not us then why should we be tender
to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
play judge and executioner all himself
for we do fear the law What company
discover you abroad
no single soul
can we set eye on but in all safe reason
he must have some attendants Though his humour
was nothing but mutation ay and that
from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
absolute madness could so far have rav'd
to bring him here alone Although perhaps
it may be heard at court that such as we
cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
may make some stronger head the which he hearing
as it is like him might break out and swear
he'd fetch us in yet is t not probable
to come alone either he so undertaking
or they so suffering then on good ground we fear
if we do fear this body hath a tail
more perilous than the head

let ordinance
come as the gods foresay it howsoe'er

I had no mind
to hunt this day the boy Fidele's sickness
did make my way long forth

with his own sword
which he did wave against my throat I have ta'en
his head from him I'll throw t into the creek
behind our rock and let it to the sea
and tell the fishes he's the queen's son Cloten
that's all I reck


I fear twill be reveng'd
would Polydore thou hadst not done t though valour
becomes thee well enough

would I had done t
so the revenge alone pursu'd me Polydore
thou hast robb'd me of this deed I would revenges
that possible strength might meet would seek us through
and put us to our answer

well tis done
we'll hunt no more to-day nor seek for danger
where there's no profit I prithee to our rock
you and Fidele play the cooks I'll stay
till hasty Polydore return and bring him
to dinner presently

poor sick Fidele
I'll willingly to him to gain his colour
I'd let a parish of such Clotens blood
and praise myself for charity


O thou goddess
thou divine Nature how thyself thou blazon'st
as zephyrs blowing below the violet
not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
their royal blood enchaf'd as the rud'st wind
that by the top doth take the mountain pine
and make him stoop to the vale Tis wonder
that an invisible instinct should frame them
to royalty unlearn'd honour untaught
civility not seen from other valour
that wildly grows in them but yields a crop
as if it had been sow'd Yet still it's strange
what Cloten's being here to us portends
or what his death will bring us


where's my brother
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream
in embassy to his mother his body's hostage
for his return

my ingenious instrument
hark Polydore it sounds but what occasion
hath Cadwal now to give it motion Hark

is he at home

he went hence even now

what does he mean since death of my dear'st mother
it did not speak before All solemn things
should answer solemn accidents The matter
triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
is jollity for apes and grief for boys
is Cadwal mad


look here he comes
and brings the dire occasion in his arms
of what we blame him for
the bird is dead
that we have made so much on I had rather
have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty
to have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch
than have seen this

O sweetest fairest lily
my brother wears thee not the one half so well
as when thou grew'st thyself

O melancholy
who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
might easiliest harbour in Thou blessed thing
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made but I
thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
how found you him

stark as you see
not as death's dart being laugh'd at his right cheek
reposing on a cushion

where

o' the floor
his arms thus leagu'd I thought he slept and put
my clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
answer'd my steps too loud

why he but sleeps
if he be gone he'll make his grave a bed
with female fairies will his tomb be haunted
and worms will not come to thee

with fairest flowers
while summer lasts and I live here Fidele
I'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
the flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor
the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
out-sweeten'd not thy breath the ruddock would
with charitable bill O bill sore-shaming
those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
without a monument bring thee all this
yea and furr'd moss besides when flowers are none
to winter-ground thy corse

prithee have done
and do not play in wench-like words with that
which is so serious Let us bury him
and not protract with admiration what
is now due debt To the grave

say where shall s lay him

by good Euriphile our mother

be t so
have got the mannish crack sing him to the ground
as once our mother use like note and words
save that Euriphile must be Fidele

Cadwal
I cannot sing I'll weep and word it with thee
for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
than priests and fanes that lie

we'll speak it then

great griefs I see medicine the less for Cloten
is quite forgot He was a queen's son boys
and though he came our enemy remember
he was paid for that though mean and mighty rotting
together have one dust yet reverence
that angel of the world doth make distinction
of place tween high and low Our foe was princely
and though you took his life as being our foe

pray you fetch him hither
thersites' body is as good as Ajax'
when neither are alive

if you'll go fetch him
we'll say our song the whilst Brother begin


nay Cadwal we must lay his head to the east
my father hath a reason for t

'Tis true

come on then and remove him

so begin


nor the furious winter's rages
thou thy worldly task hast done
home art gone and ta'en thy wages
golden lads and girls all must
as chimney-sweepers come to dust

fear no more the frown o' the great
thou art past the tyrant's stroke
care no more to clothe and eat
to thee the reed is as the oak
the sceptre learning physic must
all follow this and come to dust

fear no more the lightning-flash

nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone

fear not slander censure rash


all lovers young all lovers must
consign to thee and come to dust

no exorciser harm thee

nor no witchcraft charm thee

ghost unlaid forbear thee

nothing ill come near thee

quiet consummation have
and renowned be thy grave

we have done our obsequies Come lay him down

here's a few flowers but bout mid-night more
the herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
you were as flowers now wither'd even so
these herblets shall which we upon you strew
come on away apart upon our knees
the ground that gave them first has them again
their pleasures here are past so is their pain


yes sir to Milford-Haven which is the way
I thank you By yond bush Pray how far thither
'Ods pittikins can it be six mile yet
I have gone all night Faith I'll lie down and sleep


but soft no bed-fellow O gods and goddesses
these flowers are like the pleasures of the world
this bloody man the care on t I hope I dream
for so I thought I was a cave-keeper
and cook to honest creatures but tis not so
'Twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing
are sometimes like our judgments blind Good faith
I tremble still with fear but if there be
yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
as a wren's eye fear'd gods a part of it
the dream's here still even when I wake it is
without me as within me not imagin'd felt
a headless man The garments of Posthumus
I know the shape of s leg this is his hand
his foot Mercurial his Martial thigh
the brawns of Hercules but his Jovial face
murder in heaven How Tis gone Pisanio
all curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks
and mine to boot be darted on thee Thou
conspir'd with that irregulous devil Cloten
hast here cut off my lord To write and read
be henceforth treacherous Damn'd Pisanio
hath with his forged letters damn'd Pisanio
from this most bravest vessel of the world
struck the main-top O Posthumus alas
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart
and left this head on How should this be Pisanio
'Tis he and Cloten malice and lucre in them
have laid this woe here O tis pregnant pregnant
the drug he gave me which he said was precious
and cordial to me have I not found it
murderous to the senses That confirms it home
this is Pisanio's deed and Cloten's O
give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood
that we the horrider may seem to those
which chance to find us O my lord my lord

to them the legions garrison'd in Gallia
after your will have cross'd the sea attending
you here at Milford-Haven with your ships
they are in readiness

but what from Rome

and gentlemen of Italy most willing spirits
that promise noble service and they come
under the conduct of bold Iachimo
sienna's brother

when expect you them

with the next benefit o' the wind

this forwardness
makes our hopes fair Command our present numbers
be muster'd bid the captains look to t Now sir
what have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose

last night the very gods show'd me a vision
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence thus
I saw Jove's bird the Roman eagle wing'd
from the spongy south to this part of the west
there vanish'd in the sunbeams which portends
success to the Roman host

dream often so
and never false Soft ho what trunk is here
without his top The ruin speaks that sometime
it was a worthy building How a page
or dead or sleeping on him But dead rather
for nature doth abhor to make his bed
with the defunct or sleep upon the dead
let's see the boy's face

he's alive my lord

he'll then instruct us of this body Young one
inform us of thy fortunes for it seems
they crave to be demanded Who is this
thou mak'st thy bloody pillow Or who was he
that otherwise than noble nature did
hath alter'd that good picture What's thy interest
what art thou

I am nothing or if not
nothing to be were better This was my master
a very valiant Briton and a good
that here by mountaineers lies slain Alas
there are no more such masters I may wander
from east to occident cry out for service
try many all good serve truly never
find such another master

'Lack good youth
thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than
thy master in bleeding Say his name good friend

Richard du Champ

if I do lie and do
no harm by it though the gods hear I hope

thy name

Fidele sir

thou dost approve thyself the very same
thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name
wilt take thy chance with me I will not say
thou shalt be so well master'd but be sure
no less belov'd The Roman emperor's letters
sent by a consul to me should not sooner
than thine own worth prefer thee Go with me

I'll follow sir But first an t please the gods
I'll hide my master from the flies as deep
as these poor pickaxes can dig and when
with wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave
and on it said a century of prayers
such as I can twice o'er I'll weep and sigh
so please you entertain me

ay good youth
and rather father thee than master thee
my friends
the boy hath taught us manly duties let us
find out the prettiest daisied plot we can
and make him with our pikes and partisans
a grave come arm him Boy he is preferr'd
by thee to us and he shall be interr'd
as soldiers can Be cheerful wipe thine eyes
some falls are means the happier to arise


again and bring me word how tis with her

a fever with the absence of her son
a madness of which her life's in danger Heavens
how deeply you at once do touch me Imogen
upon a desperate bed and in a time
when fearful wars point at me her son gone
so needful for this present it strikes me past
the hope of comfort But for thee fellow
who needs must know of her departure and
dost seem so ignorant we'll enforce it from thee
by a sharp torture

sir my life is yours
I humbly set it at your will but for my mistress
I nothing know where she remains why gone
nor when she purposes return Beseech your highness
hold me your loyal servant

good my liege
the day that she was missing he was here
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
all parts of his subjection loyally For Cloten
there wants no diligence in seeking him

the time is troublesome


we'll slip you for a season but our jealousy
does yet depend

so please-your majesty
the Roman legions all from Gallia drawn
are landed on your coast with a supply
of Roman gentlemen by the senate sent

now for the counsel of my son and queen
I am amaz'd with matter

good my liege
your preparation can affront no less
than what you hear of come more for more you're ready
the want is but to put those powers in motion

I thank you Let's withdraw
and meet the time as it seeks us We fear not
what can from Italy annoy us but
we grieve at chances here Away


I heard no letter from my master since
I wrote him Imogen was slain tis strange
nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
to yield me often tidings neither know I
what is betid to Cloten but remain
perplex'd in all the heavens still must work
wherein I am false I am honest not true to be true
these present wars shall find I love my country
even to the note o' the king or I'll fall in them
all other doubts by time let them be clear'd
fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd

the noise is round about us

let us from it

what pleasure sir find we in life to lock it
from action and adventure

nay what hope
have we in hiding us this way the Romans
must or for Britons slay us or receive us
for barbarous and unnatural revolts
during their use and slay us after

sons
we'll higher to the mountains there secure us
to the king's party there's no going newness
of Cloten's death we being not known not muster'd
among the bands may drive us to a render
where we have liv'd and so extort from s that
drawn on with torture

this is sir a doubt
in such a time nothing becoming you
nor satisfying us

it is not likely
that when they hear the Roman horses neigh
behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes
and ears so cloy'd importantly as now
that they will waste their time upon our note
to know from whence we are

O I am known
of many in the army many years
though Cloten then but young you see not wore him
from my remembrance And besides the king
hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves
who find in my exile the want of breeding
to have the courtesy your cradle promis'd
but to be still hot summer's tanlings and
the shrinking slaves of winter

than be so
better to cease to be Pray sir to the army
I and my brother are not known yourself
so out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown
cannot be question'd

by this sun that shines
I'll thither what thing is it that I never
did see man die scarce ever look'd on blood
but that of coward hares hot goats and venison
never bestrid a horse save one that had
a rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel
nor iron on his heel I am asham'd
to look upon the holy sun to have
the benefit of his bless'd beams remaining

by heavens I'll go
if you will bless me sir and give me leave
I'll take the better care but if you will not
the hazard therefore due fall on me by
the hands of Romans

so say I amen

no reason I since of your lives you set
so slight a valuation should reserve
my crack'd one to more care Have with you boys
if in your country wars you chance to die
that is my bed too lads and there I'll lie
lead lead

the time seems long their blood thinks scorn
till it fly out and show them princes born

thou shouldst be colour'd thus You married ones
if each of you should take this course how many
must murder wives much better than themselves
for wrying but a little O Pisanio
every good servant does not all commands
no bond but to do just ones Gods if you
should have ta'en vengeance on my faults I never
had liv'd to put on this so had you sav'd
the noble Imogen to repent and struck
me wretch more worth your vengeance But alack
you snatch some hence for little faults that's love
to have them fall no more you some permit
to second ills with ills each elder worse
and make them dread it to the doers' thrift
but Imogen is your own do your best wills
and make me bless'd to obey I am brought hither
among the Italian gentry and to fight
against my lady's kingdom tis enough
that Britain I have kill'd thy mistress-piece
hear patiently my purpose I'll disrobe me
of these Italian weeds and suit myself
as does a Briton peasant so I'll fight
against the part I come with so I'll die
for thee O Imogen even for whom my life
is every breath a death and thus unknown
pitied nor hated to the face of peril
myself I'll dedicate Let me make men know
more valour in me than my habits show
gods put the strength o' the Leonati in me
to shame the guise o' the world I will begin
the fashion less without and more within


the heaviness and guilt within my bosom
takes off my manhood I have belied a lady
the princess of this country and the air on t
revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl
a very drudge of nature's have subdu'd me
as I wear mine are titles but of scorn
if that thy gentry Britain go before
this lout as he exceeds our lords the odds
is that we scarce are men and you are gods


stand stand We have the advantage of the ground
the lane is guarded nothing routs us but
the villany of our fears

stand stand and fight

stand stand and fight

away boy from the troops and save thyself
for friends kill friends and the disorder's such
as war were hoodwink'd

'Tis their fresh supplies
it is a day turn'd strangely or betimes
let's re-inforce or fly


cam'st thou from where they made the stand

I did
though you it seems come from the fliers

I did

no blame be to you sir for all was lost
but that the heavens fought The king himself
of his wings destitute the army broken
and but the backs of Britons seen all flying
through a strait lane the enemy full-hearted
lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work
more plentiful than tools to do t struck down
some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling
with dead men hurt behind and cowards living
to die with lengthen'd shame

where was this lane

close by the battle ditch'd and wall'd with turf
which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
an honest one I warrant who deserv'd
so long a breeding as his white beard came to
in doing this for his country athwart the lane
he with two striplings lads more like to run
the country base than to commit such slaughter
with faces fit for masks or rather fairer
than those for preservation cas'd or shame
made good the passage cried to those that fled
'Our Britain's harts die flying not our men
to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards Stand
or we are Romans and will give you that
like beasts which you shun beastly and may save
three thousand confident in act as many
for three performers are the file when all
the rest do nothing with this word Stand stand
accommodated by the place more charming
with their own nobleness which could have turn'd
a distaff to a lance gilded pale looks
part shame part spirit renew'd that some turn'd coward
but by example O a sin of war
damn'd in the first beginners gan to look
the way that they did and to grin like lions
upon the pikes o' the hunters Then began
a stop i' the chaser a retire anon
a rout confusion thick forthwith they fly
chickens the way which they stoop'd eagles slaves
the strides they victors made And now our cowards
like fragments in hard voyages became
the life o' the need having found the back door open
of the unguarded hearts Heavens how they wound
some slain before some dying some their friends
are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty
those that would die or ere resist are grown
the mortal bugs o' the field

this was strange chance
a narrow lane an old man and two boys

nay do not wonder at it you are made
rather to wonder at the things you hear
than to work any Will you rime upon t
and vent it for a mockery Here is one
'Two boys an old man twice a boy a lane
preserv'd the Britons was the Romans' bane

nay be not angry sir

'Lack to what end
who dares not stand his foe I'll be his friend
for if he'll do as he is made to do
you have put me into rime

farewell you're angry


still going This is a lord O noble misery
to be i' the field and ask what news of me
to-day how many would have given their honours
to have sav'd their carcases took heel to do t
and yet died too I in mine own woe charm'd
could not find death where I did hear him groan
nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds
sweet words or hath more ministers than we
that draw his knives i' the war Well I will find him
for being now a favourer to the Briton
no more a Briton I have resum'd again
the part I came in fight I will no more
but yield me to the veriest hind that shall
here made by the Roman great the answer be
Britons must take For me my ransom's death
on either side I come to spend my breath
which neither here I'll keep nor bear agen
but end it by some means for Imogen


great Jupiter be prais'd Lucius is taken
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels

there was a fourth man in a silly habit
that gave th' affront with them

so tis reported
but none of em can be found Stand who is there

a Roman
who had not now been drooping here if seconds
had answer'd him
lay hands on him a dog
a lag of Rome shall not return to tell
what crows have peck'd them here He brags his service
as if he were of note bring him to the king


you shall not now be stol'n you have locks upon you
so graze as you find pasture

ay or a stomach


most welcome bondage for thou art a way
I think to liberty Yet am I better
than one that's sick o' the gout since he had rather
groan so in perpetuity than be cur'd
by the sure physician death who is the key
to unbar these locks My conscience thou art fetter'd
more than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me
then free for ever Is t enough I am sorry
so children temporal fathers do appease
gods are more full of mercy Must I repent
I cannot do it better than in gyves
desir'd more than constrain'd to satisfy
if of my freedom tis the main part take
no stricter render of me than my all
I know you are more clement than vile men
who of their broken debtors take a third
a sixth a tenth letting them thrive again
on their abatement that's not my desire
for Imogen's dear life take mine and though
'Tis not so dear yet tis a life you coin'd it
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp
though light take pieces for the figure's sake
you rather mine being yours and so great powers
if you will take this audit take this life
and cancel these cold bonds O Imogen
I'll speak to thee in silence

no more thou thunder-master show
thy spite on mortal flies
with Mars fall out with Juno chide
that thy adulteries
rates and revenges
hath my poor boy done aught but well
whose face I never saw
I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
attending nature's law
whose father then as men report
thou orphans' father art
thou shouldst have been and shielded him
from this earth-vexing smart

Lucina lent not me her aid
but took me in my throes
that from me was Posthumus ript
came crying mongst his foes

great nature like his ancestry
moulded the stuff so fair
that he deserv'd the praise o' the world
as great Sicilius' heir

when once he was mature for man
in Britain where was he
that could stand up his parallel
or fruitful object be
in eye of Imogen that best
could deem his dignity

with marriage wherefore was he mock'd
to be exil'd and thrown
from Leonati's seat and cast
from her his dearest one
sweet Imogen

slight thing of Italy
to taint his nobler heart and brain
with needless jealousy
and to become the geck and scorn
o' the other's villany

for this from stiller seats we came
our parents and us twain
that striking in our country's cause
fell bravely and were slain
our fealty and Tenantius' right
with honour to maintain

like hardiment Posthumus hath
to Cymbeline perform'd
then Jupiter thou king of gods
why hast thou thus adjourn'd
the graces for his merits due
being all to dolours turn'd
thy crystal window ope look out
no longer exercise
upon a valiant race thy harsh
and potent injuries

since Jupiter our son is good
take off his miseries

peep through thy marble mansion help
or we poor ghosts will cry
to the shining synod of the rest
against thy deity

help Jupiter or we appeal
and from thy justice fly


no more you petty spirits of region low Offend our hearing hush How dare you ghosts
accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
poor shadows of Elysium hence and rest
upon your never-withering banks of flowers
be not with mortal accidents opprest
no care of yours it is you know tis ours
whom best I love I cross to make my gift
the more delay'd delighted Be content
your low-laid son our godhead will uplift
his comforts thrive his trials well are spent
our Jovial star reign'd at his birth and in
our temple was he married Rise and fade
he shall be lord of Lady Imogen
and happier much by his affliction made
this tablet lay upon his breast wherein
our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
and so away no further with your din
express impatience lest you stir up mine
mount eagle to my palace crystalline


was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle
stoop'd as to foot us his ascension is
more sweet than our bless'd fields his royal bird
prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
as when his god is pleas'd

thanks Jupiter

the marble pavement closes he is enter'd
his radiant roof Away and to be blest
let us with care perform his great behest


sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot
a father to me and thou hast created
a mother and two brothers But O scorn
gone they went hence so soon as they were born
and so I am awake Poor wretches that depend
on greatness' favour dream as I have done
many dream not to find neither deserve
and yet are steep'd in favours so am I
that have this golden chance and know not why
what fairies haunt this ground A book O rare one
be not as is our fangled world a garment
nobler than that it covers let thy effects
so follow to be most unlike our courtiers
as good as promise
whenas a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall Posthumus end his miseries Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty
'Tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
tongue and brain not either both or nothing
or senseless speaking or a speaking such
as sense cannot untie Be what it is
the action of my life is like it which
I'll keep if but for sympathy


come sir are you ready for death


hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are well cooked

so if I prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot

a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is you shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern-bills which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth You come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier for being too light the purse too light being drawn of heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be quit O the charity of a penny cord it sums up thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and creditor but it of what's past is and to come the discharge Your neck sir is pen book and counters so the acquittance follows

I am merrier to die than thou art to live

indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache but a man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to bed I think he would change places with his officer for look you sir you know not which way you shall go

yes indeed do I fellow

your death has eyes in s head then I have not seen him so pictured you must either be directed by some that take upon them to know or take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how you shall speed in your journey's end I think you'll never return to tell one

I tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going but such as wink and will not use them

what an infinite mock is this that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness I am sure hanging's the way of winking

knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king

thou bring'st good news I am called to be made free

I'll be hang'd then

thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead


unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets I never saw one so prone Yet on my conscience there are verier knaves desire to live for all he be a Roman and there be some of them too that die against their wills so should I if I were one I would we were all of one mind and one mind good O there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses I speak against my present profit but my wish hath a preferment in t


stand by my side you whom the gods have made
preservers of my throne Woe is my heart
that the poor soldier that so richly fought
whose rags sham'd gilded arms whose naked breast
stepp'd before targes of proof cannot be found
he shall be happy that can find him if
our grace can make him so
I never saw
such noble fury in so poor a thing
such precious deeds in one that promis'd nought
but beggary and poor looks

no tidings of him

he hath been search'd among the dead and living
but no trace of him

to my grief I am
the heir of his reward which I will add

to you the liver heart and brain of Britain
by whom I grant she lives Tis now the time
to ask of whence you are report it

sir
in Cambria are we born and gentlemen
unless I add we are honest

bow your knees
arise my knights o' the battle I create you
companions to our person and will fit you
with dignities becoming your estates


there's business in these faces Why so sadly
greet you our victory you look like Romans

and not o' the court of Britain

hail great king
to sour your happiness I must report
the queen is dead

whom worse than a physician
would this report become But I consider
will seize the doctor too How ended she

with horror madly dying like her life
which being cruel to the world concluded
most cruel to herself What she confess'd
I will report so please you these her women
can trip me if I err who with wet cheeks
were present when she finish'd

prithee say

first she confess'd she never lov'd you only
affected greatness got by you not you
married your royalty was wife to your place
abhorr'd your person

she alone knew this
and but she spoke it dying I would not
believe her lips in opening it Proceed
your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
with such integrity she did confess
was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
but that her flight prevented it she had
ta'en off by poison

O most delicate fiend
who is't can read a woman Is there more

more sir and worse She did confess she had
for you a mortal mineral which being took
should by the minute feed on life and ling'ring
by inches waste you in which time she purpos'd
by watching weeping tendance kissing to
o'ercome you with her show yea and in time
when she had fitted you with her craft to work
her son into the adoption of the crown
but failing of her end by his strange absence
grew shameless-desperate open'd in despite
the evils she hatch'd were not effected so
despairing died

heard you all this her women

we did so please your highness

mine eyes
were not in fault for she was beautiful
mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
that thought her like her seeming it had been vicious
to have mistrusted her yet O my daughter
that it was folly in me thou mayst say
and prove it in thy feeling Heaven mend all

thou com'st not Caius now for tribute that
the Britons have raz'd out though with the loss
of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
that their good souls may be appeas'd with slaughter

so think of your estate

consider sir the chance of war the day
was yours by accident had it gone with us
we should not when the blood was cool have threaten'd
our prisoners with the sword But since the gods
will have it thus that nothing but our lives
may be call'd ransom let it come sufficeth
a Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer
Augustus lives to think on t and so much
for my peculiar care This one thing only
I will entreat my boy a Briton born
let him be ransom'd never master had
a page so kind so duteous diligent
so tender over his occasions true
so feat so nurse-like Let his virtue join
with my request which I'll make bold your highness
cannot deny he hath done no Briton harm
and spare no blood beside

I have surely seen him
his favour is familiar to me Boy
thou hast look'd thyself into my grace
and art mine own I know not why nor wherefore
to say live boy ne'er thank thy master live
and ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt
fitting my bounty and thy state I'll give it
yea though thou do demand a prisoner
the noblest ta'en

I humbly thank your highness

I do not bid thee beg my life good lad
and yet I know thou wilt

no no alack
there's other work in hand I see a thing
must shuffle for itself

the boy disdains me
he leaves me scorns me briefly die their joys
that place them on the truth of girls and boys
why stands he so perplex'd

what wouldst thou boy
I love thee more and more think more and more
what's best to ask Know'st him thou look'st on speak
wilt have him live Is he thy kin thy friend

he is a Roman no more kin to me
than I to your highness who being born your vassal
am something nearer

wherefore ey'st him so

I'll tell you sir in private if you please

ay with all my heart
and lend my best attention What's thy name

Fidele sir

thou'rt my good youth my page
I'll be thy master walk with me speak freely


is not this boy reviv'd from death

one sand another
not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
who died and was Fidele What think you

the same dead thing alive

peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear
he would have spoke to us

but we saw him dead

be silent let's see further

it is my mistress
since she is living let the time run on
to good or bad


come stand thou by our side
make thy demand aloud

sir step you forth
give answer to this boy and do it freely
or by our greatness and the grace of it
which is our honour bitter torture shall
winnow the truth from falsehood On speak to him
my boon is that this gentleman may render
of whom he had this ring

what's that to him

that diamond upon your finger say
how came it yours

thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
which to be spoke would torture thee

how me

I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
which torments me to conceal By villany
I got this ring twas Leonatus' jewel
whom thou didst banish and which more may grieve thee
as it doth me a nobler sir ne'er liv'd
'Twixt sky and ground Wilt thou hear more my lord
all that belongs to this

that paragon thy daughter
for whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
quail to remember Give me leave I faint

my daughter what of her Renew thy strength
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
than die ere I hear more Strive man and speak

upon a time unhappy was the clock
that struck the hour it was in Rome accurs'd
the mansion where twas at a feast O would
our viands had been poison'd or at least
those which I heav'd to head the good Posthumus
what should I say he was too good to be
where ill men were and was the best of all
amongst the rar'st of good ones sitting sadly
hearing us praise our loves of Italy
of him that best could speak for feature laming
the shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva
postures beyond brief nature for condition
a shop of all the qualities that man
loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
fairness which strikes the eye

I stand on fire
come to the matter

all too soon I shall
unless thou wouldst grieve quickly This Posthumus
most like a noble lord in love and one
that had a royal lover took his hint
and not dispraising whom we prais'd therein
he was as calm as virtue he began
his mistress' picture which by his tongue being made
and then a mind put in t either our brags
were crack'd of kitchen trulls or his description

nay nay to the purpose

your daughter's chastity there it begins
he spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
and she alone were cold whereat I wretch
made scruple of his praise and wager'd with him
pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore
upon his honour'd finger to attain
in suit the place of his bed and win this ring
by hers and mine adultery He true knight
no lesser of her honour confident
than I did truly find her stakes this ring
and would so had it been a carbuncle
of Ph bus' wheel and might so safely had it
been all the worth of s car Away to Britain
post I in this design Well may you sir
remember me at court where I was taught
of your chaste daughter the wide difference
of hope not longing mine Italian brain
'Gan in your duller Britain operate
most vilely for my vantage excellent
and to be brief my practice so prevail'd
that I return'd with simular proof enough
to make the noble Leonatus mad
by wounding his belief in her renown
with tokens thus and thus averring notes
of chamber-hanging pictures this her bracelet
oh cunning how I got it nay some marks
of secret on her person that he could not
but think her bond of chastity quite crack'd
I having ta'en the forfeit Whereupon
methinks I see him now

ay so thou dost
Italian fiend Ay me most credulous fool
egregious murderer thief any thing
that's due to all the villains past in being
some upright justicer Thou king send out
for torturers ingenious it is I
that all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
by being worse than they I am Posthumus
that kill'd thy daughter villain-like I lie
that caus'd a lesser villain than myself
a sacrilegious thief to do t the temple
of virtue was she yea and she herself
spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set
the dogs o' the street to bay me every villain
be call'd Posthumus Leonatus and
be villany less than twas O Imogen
my queen my life my wife O Imogen
Imogen Imogen

peace my lord hear hear

shall s have a play of this Thou scornful page
there lie thy part

O gentlemen help
mine and your mistress O my Lord Posthumus
you ne'er kill'd Imogen till now Help help
mine honour'd lady

does the world go round

how come these staggers on me

wake my mistress

if this be so the gods do mean to strike me
to death with mortal joy

how fares my mistress

O get thee from my sight
thou gav'st me poison dangerous fellow hence

the tune of Imogen

lady
the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
that box I gave you was not thought by me
a precious thing I had it from the queen

new matter still

it poison'd me

O gods
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd
which must approve thee honest If Pisanio
have said she given his mistress that confection
which I gave him for cordial she is serv'd
as I would serve a rat


the queen sir very oft importun'd me
to temper poisons for her still pretending
the satisfaction of her knowledge only
in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
of no esteem I dreading that her purpose
was of more danger did compound for her
a certain stuff which being ta'en would cease
the present power of life but in short time
all offices of nature should again
do their due functions Have you ta'en of it

most like I did for I was dead

my boys
there was our error

this is sure Fidele

think that you are upon a rock and now
throw me again


hang there like fruit my soul
till the tree die

how now my flesh my child
what mak'st thou me a dullard in this act
wilt thou not speak to me

your blessing sir

though you did love this youth I blame ye not
you had a motive for t

my tears that fall
prove holy water on thee Imogen
thy mother's dead
I am sorry for t my lord

O she was naught and long of her it was
that we meet here so strangely but her son
is gone we know not how nor where

my lord
now fear is from me I'll speak troth Lord Cloten
upon my lady's missing came to me
with his sword drawn foam'd at the mouth and swore
if I discover'd not which way she was gone
it was my instant death By accident
I had a feigned letter of my master's
then in my pocket which directed him
to seek her on the mountains near to Milford
where in a frenzy in my master's garments
which he enforc'd from me away he posts
with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
my lady's honour what became of him

let me end the story
I slew him there

marry the gods forfend
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
pluck a hard sentence Prithee valiant youth
deny t again

I have spoke it and I did it

he was a prince

a most incivil one The wrongs he did me
were nothing prince-like for he did provoke me
with language that would make me spurn the sea
if it could so roar to me I cut off s head
and am right glad he is not standing here
to tell this tale of mine
I am sorry for thee
by thine own tongue thou art condemn'd and must
endure our law Thou'rt dead

that headless man
I thought had been my lord

bind the offender
and take him from our presence

stay sir king
this man is better than the man he slew
as well descended as thyself and hath
more of thee merited than a band of Clotens
had ever scar for

let his arms alone
they were not born for bondage

wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
by tasting of our wrath How of descent
as good as we

in that he spake too far

and thou shalt die for t

we will die all three
but I will prove that two on s are as good
as I have given out him My sons I must
for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
though haply well for you

your danger's ours

and our good his

have at it then by leave
Belarius

what of him he is
a banish'd traitor

he it is that hath
assum'd this age indeed a banish'd man
I know not how a traitor

take him hence
the whole world shall not save him

not too hot
first pay me for the nursing of thy sons
and let it be confiscate all so soon
as I have receiv'd it

nursing of my sons

ere I arise I will prefer my sons
then spare not the old father Mighty sir
these two young gentlemen that call me father
and think they are my sons are none of mine
they are the issue of your loins my liege
and blood of your begetting

how my issue

so sure as you your father's I old Morgan
am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd
your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
itself and all my treason that I suffer'd
was all the harm I did These gentle princes
for such and so they are these twenty years
have I train'd up those arts they have as I
could put into them my breeding was sir as
your highness knows Their nurse Euriphile
whom for the theft I wedded stole these children
having receiv'd the punishment before
for that which I did then beaten for loyalty
excited me to treason Their dear loss
the more of you twas felt the more it shap'd
unto my end of stealing them But gracious sir
here are your sons again and I must lose
two of the sweet'st companions in the world
the benediction of these covering heavens
fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
to inlay heaven with stars

thou weep'st and speak'st
the service that you three have done is more
unlike than this thou tell'st I lost my children
if these be they I know not how to wish
a pair of worthier sons

be pleas'd awhile
this gentleman whom I call Polydore
this gentleman my Cadwal Arviragus
your younger princely son he sir was lapp'd
in a most curious mantle wrought by the hand
of his queen mother which for more probation
I can with ease produce

Guiderius had
upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
it was a mark of wonder

this is he
who hath upon him still that natural stamp
it was wise nature's end in the donation
to be his evidence now

O what am I
a mother to the birth of three Ne'er mother
rejoic'd deliverance more Blest pray you be
that after this strange starting from your orbs
thou hast lost by this a kingdom

no my lord
I have got two worlds by t O my gentle brothers
have we thus met O never say hereafter
but I am truest speaker you call'd me brother
when I was but your sister I you brothers
when ye were so indeed

did you e'er meet

ay my good lord

and at first meeting lov'd
continu'd so until we thought he died

by the queen's dram she swallow'd

O rare instinct
hath to it circumstantial branches which
distinction should be rich in Where how liv'd you
and when came you to serve our Roman captive
how parted with your brothers how first met them
why fied you from the court and whither These
and your three motives to the battle with
I know not how much more should be demanded
and all the other by-dependances
from chance to chance but nor the time nor place
will serve our long inter'gatories See
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen
and she like harmless lightning throws her eye
on him her brothers me her master hitting
each object with a joy the counterchange
is severally in all Let's quit this ground
and smoke the temple with our sacrifices


thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever
you are my father too and did relieve me
to see this gracious season

all o'erjoy'd
save these in bonds let them be joyful too
for they shall taste our comfort

my good master
I will yet do you service

happy be you

the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
he would have well becom'd this place and grac'd
the thankings of a king

I am sir
the soldier that did company these three
in poor beseeming twas a fitment for
speak Iachimo I had you down and might
have made you finish

I am down again
but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
as then your force did Take that life beseech you
which I so often owe but your ring first
and here the bracelet of the truest princess
that ever swore her faith

kneel not to me
the power that I have on you is to spare you
the malice towards you to forgive you Live
and deal with others better

nobly doom'd
we'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law
pardon's the word to all

as you did mean indeed to be our brother
joy'd are we that you are

your servant princes Good my lord of Rome
call forth your soothsayer As I slept methought
great Jupiter upon his eagle back'd
appear'd to me with other spritely shows
of mine own kindred when I wak'd I found
this label on my bosom whose containing
is so from sense in hardness that I can
make no collection of it let him show
his skill in the construction

philarmonus

here my good lord

read and declare the meaning

thou Leonatus art the lion's whelp
the fit and apt construction of thy name
being Leo-natus doth import so much


the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
which we call mollis aer and mollis aer
we term it mulier which mulier I divine
is this most constant wife who even now
answering the letter of the oracle
unknown to you

unsought were clipp'd about
with this most tender air

this hath some seeming

the lofty cedar royal Cymbeline
personates thee and thy lopp'd branches point
for many years thought dead are now reviv'd
to the majestic cedar join'd whose issue
promises Britain peace and plenty

well
my peace we will begin And Caius Lucius
although the victor we submit to C sar
and to the Roman empire promising
to pay our wonted tribute from the which
we were dissuaded by our wicked queen
whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
have laid most heavy hand

the fingers of the powers above do tune
the harmony of this peace The vision
which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
of this yet scarce-cold battle at this instant
is full accomplish'd for the Roman eagle
from south to west on wing soaring aloft
so vanish'd which foreshow'd our princely eagle
the imperial C sar should again unite
his favour with the radiant Cymbeline
which shines here in the west

laud we the gods
and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
from our bless'd altars Publish we this peace
to all our subjects Set we forward let
a Roman and a British ensign wave
friendly together so through Lud's town march
and in the temple of great Jupiter
our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts
set on there Never was a war did cease
ere bloody hands were wash'd with such a peace

LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST

let fame that all hunt after in their lives
and then grace us in the disgrace of death
when spite of cormorant devouring Time
the endeavour of this present breath may buy
that honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
and make us heirs of all eternity
therefore brave conquerors for so you are
that war against your own affections
and the huge army of the world's desires
our late edict shall strongly stand in force
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world
our court shall be a little academe
still and contemplative in living art
you three Berowne Dumaine and Longaville
have sworn for three years' term to live with me
my fellow-scholars and to keep those statutes
that are recorded in this schedule here
your oaths are pass'd and now subscribe your names
that his own hand may strike his honour down
that violates the smallest branch herein
subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too

I am resolv'd tis but a three years' fast
the mind shall banquet though the body pine
fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits

my loving lord Dumaine is mortified
the grosser manner of these world's delights
he throws upon the gross world's baser slaves
to love to wealth to pomp I pine and die
with all these living in philosophy

I can but say their protestation over
so much dear liege I have already sworn
that is to live and study here three years
but there are other strict observances
as not to see a woman in that term
which I hope well is not enrolled there
and but one meal on every day beside
the which I hope is not enrolled there
and then to sleep but three hours in the night
and not be seen to wink of all the day
when I was wont to think no harm all night
and make a dark night too of half the day
which I hope well is not enrolled there
O these are barren tasks too hard to keep
not to see ladies study fast not sleep

your oath is pass'd to pass away from these

let me say no my liege an if you please
I only swore to study with your Grace
and stay here in your court for three years' space

you swore to that Berowne and to the rest

by yea and nay sir then I swore in jest

why that to know which else we should not know

things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense

ay that is study's god-like recompense

come on then I will swear to study so
to know the thing I am forbid to know
as thus to study where I well may dine
when I to feast expressly am forbid
or study where to meet some mistress fine
when mistresses from common sense are hid
or having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath
study to break it and not break my troth
if study's gain be thus and this be so
study knows that which yet it doth not know
swear me to this and I will ne'er say no

and train our intellects to vain delight

why all delights are vain but that most vain
which with pain purchas'd doth inherit pain
as painfully to pore upon a book
to seek the light of truth while truth the while
doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
light seeking light doth light of light beguile
so ere you find where light in darkness lies
your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
study me how to please the eye indeed
by fixing it upon a fairer eye
who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
and give him light that it was blinded by
study is like the heaven's glorious sun
that will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks
small have continual plodders ever won
save base authority from others' books
these earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
have no more profit of their shining nights
than those that walk and wot not what they are
too much to know is to know nought but fame
and every godfather can give a name

how well he's read to reason against reading

proceeded well to stop all good proceeding

he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding

the spring is near when green geese are a-breeding

how follows that

fit in his place and time

in reason nothing


Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
that bites the first-born infants of the spring

well say I am why should proud summer boast
before the birds have any cause to sing
why should I joy in an abortive birth
at Christmas I no more desire a rose
than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth
but like of each thing that in season grows
so you to study now it is too late
climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate

well sit you out go home Berowne adieu

no my good lord I have sworn to stay with you
and though I have for barbarism spoke more
than for that angel knowledge you can say
yet confident I'll keep to what I swore
give me the paper let me read the same
and to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name

how well this yielding rescues thee from shame

Item That no woman shall come within a mile of my court Hath this been proclaimed

four days ago

let's see the penalty On pain of losing her tongue Who devised this penalty

marry that did I

sweet lord and why

to fright them hence with that dread penalty

a dangerous law against gentility

this article my liege yourself must break
for well you know here comes in embassy
the French king's daughter with yourself to speak
a maid of grace and complete majesty
about surrender up of Aquitaine
to her decrepit sick and bed-rid father
therefore this article is made in vain
or vainly comes th' admired princess hither

what say you lords why this was quite forgot

so study evermore is overshot
while it doth study to have what it would
it doth forget to do the thing it should
and when it hath the thing it hunteth most
'Tis won as towns with fire so won so lost

we must of force dispense with this decree
she must lie here on mere necessity
necessity will make us all forsworn
three thousand times within this three years' space
for every man with his affects is born
not by might master'd but by special grace
if I break faith this word shall speak for me
I am forsworn on mere necessity
so to the laws at large I write my name

and he that breaks them in the least degree
stands in attainder of eternal shame
suggestions are to others as to me
but I believe although I seem so loath
I am the last that will last keep his oath
but is there no quick recreation granted

ay that there is Our court you know is haunted
with a refined traveller of Spain
a man in all the world's new fashion planted
that hath a mint of phrases in his brain
doth ravish like enchanting harmony
a man of complements whom right and wrong
have chose as umpire of their mutiny
this child of fancy that Armado hight
for interim to our studies shall relate
in high-born words the worth of many a knight
from tawny Spain lost in the world's debate
how you delight my lords I know not I
but I protest I love to hear him lie
and I will use him for my minstrelsy

Armado is a most illustrious wight
a man of fire-new words fashion's own knight

Costard the swain and he shall be our sport
and so to study three years is but short


which is the duke's own person
this fellow What wouldst

I myself reprehend his own person for I am his Grace's tharborough but I would see his own person in flesh and blood

this is he

Signior Arm Arm commends you There's villany abroad this letter will tell you more

sir the contempts thereof are as touching me

a letter from the magnificent Armado

how long soever the matter I hope in God for high words

a high hope for a low heaven God grant us patience

to hear or forbear laughing

to hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to forbear both
well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness

the matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta The manner of it is I was taken with the manner

in what manner

in manner and form following sir all those three I was seen with her in the manor-house sitting with her upon the form and taken following her into the park which put together is in manner and form following Now sir for the manner it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form in some form

for the following sir

as it shall follow in my correction and God defend the right

will you hear this letter with attention

as we would hear an oracle

such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh

great deputy the welkin's vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre my soul's earth's God and body's fostering patron
not a word of Costard yet

so it is

it may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling true but so

peace

be to me and every man that dares not fight

no words

of other men's secrets I beseech you

so it is besieged with sable-coloured melancholy I did commend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air and as I am a gentleman betook myself to walk The time when About the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper so much for the time when Now for the ground which which I mean I walked upon it is ycleped thy park Then for the place where where I mean I did encounter that most obscene and preposterous event that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest But to the place where it standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden there did I see that low-spirited swain that base minnow of thy mirth

me

that unlettered small-knowing soul
me

that shallow vessel

still me

which as I remember hight Costard

O me

sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon with with O with but with this I passion to say wherewith

with a wench

with a child of our grandmother Eve a female or for thy more sweet understanding a woman Him I as my everesteemed duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment by thy sweet Grace's officer Antony Dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and estimation

me an't please you I am Antony Dull

for Jaquenetta so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain I keep her as a vessel of thy law's fury and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring her to trial Thine in all compliments of devoted and heart-burning heat of duty
this is not so well as I looked for but the best that ever I heard

ay the best for the worst But sirrah what say you to this

sir I confess the wench

did you hear the proclamation

I do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of it

it was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench

I was taken with none sir I was taken with a damosel

well it was proclaimed damosel

this was no damosel neither sir she was a virgin

it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin
if it were I deny her virginity I was taken with a maid

this maid will not serve your turn sir

this maid will serve my turn sir

sir I will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week with bran and water

I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge

and Don Armado shall be your keeper
my Lord Berowne see him deliver'd o'er
and go we lords to put in practice that
which each to other hath so strongly sworn


I'll lay my head to any good man's hat
these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn
sirrah come on
I suffer for the truth sir for true it is I was taken with Jaquenetta and Jaquenetta is a true girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity Affliction may one day smile again and till then sit thee down sorrow


boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy

a great sign sir that he will look sad

why sadness is one and the self-same thing dear imp

no no O Lord sir no

how canst thou part sadness and melancholy my tender juvenal

by a familiar demonstration of the working my tough senior

why tough senior why tough senior

why tender juvenal why tender juvenal


and I tough senior as an appertinent title to your old time which we may name tough

pretty and apt

how mean you sir I pretty and my saying apt or I apt and my saying pretty

thou pretty because little

little pretty because little Wherefore apt

and therefore apt because quick

speak you this in my praise master

in thy condign praise

I will praise an eel with the same praise


that an eel is quick

I do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood

I am answered sir

I love not to be crossed

he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him

I have promised to study three years with the duke

you may do it in an hour sir

impossible

how many is one thrice told


you are a gentleman and a gamester sir

I confess both they are both the varnish of a complete man

then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to

it doth amount to one more than two

which the base vulgar do call three

true

why sir is this such a piece of study Now here's three studied ere you'll thrice wink and how easy it is to put years' to the word three and study three years in two words the dancing horse will tell you

a most fine figure

to prove you a cipher


Hercules master

most sweet Hercules More authority dear boy name more and sweet my child let them be men of good repute and carriage

Samson master he was a man of good carriage great carriage for he carried the towngates on his back like a porter and he was in love

O well-knit Samson strong-jointed Samson I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates I am in love too Who was Samson's love my dear Moth

a woman master

of what complexion

of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four

tell me precisely of what complexion

of the sea-water green sir


as I have read sir and the best of them too

green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love of that colour methinks Samson had small reason for it He surely affected her for her wit

it was so sir for she had a green wit

my love is most immaculate white and red

most maculate thoughts master are masked under such colours

define define well-educated infant

my father's wit and my mother's tongue assist me

sweet invocation of a child most pretty and pathetical


if she be made of white and red
for blushing cheeks by faults are bred
and fears by pale white shown
then if she fear or be to blame
by this you shall not know
for still her cheeks possess the same
which native she doth owe

a dangerous rime master against the reason of white and red

is there not a ballad boy of the King and the Beggar

the world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since but I think now tis not to be found or if it were it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune

I will have that subject newly writ o'er that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent Boy I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard she deserves well

to be whipped and yet a better love than my master

sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love


I say sing

forbear till this company be past


sir the duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe and you must let him take no delight nor no penance but a' must fast three days a week For this damsel I must keep her at the park she is allowed for the day-woman
fare you well

I do betray myself with blushing Maid

man

I will visit thee at the lodge

that's hereby

I know where it is situate


I will tell thee wonders

with that face

I love thee

so I heard you say

and so farewell

fair weather after you

come Jaquenetta away


villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned

well sir I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach
thou shalt be heavily punished

I am more bound to you than your fellows for they are but lightly rewarded

take away this villain shut him up

come you transgressing slave away

let me not be pent up sir I will fast being loose

no sir that were fast and loose thou shalt to prison

well if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen some shall see

what shall some see

nay nothing Master Moth but what they look upon It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words and therefore I will say nothing I thank God I have as little patience as another man and therefore I can be quiet



now madam summon up your dearest spirits
consider whom the king your father sends
to whom he sends and what's his embassy
yourself held precious in the world's esteem
to parley with the sole inheritor
of all perfections that a man may owe
matchless Navarre the plea of no less weight
than Aquitaine a dowry for a queen
be now as prodigal of all dear grace
as Nature was in making graces dear
when she did starve the general world beside
and prodigally gave them all to you

good Lord Boyet my beauty though but mean
needs not the painted flourish of your praise
beauty is bought by judgment of the eye
not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
in spending your wit in the praise of mine
but now to task the tasker good Boyet
you are not ignorant all-telling fame
doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow
till painful study shall out-wear three years
no woman may approach his silent court
therefore to us seemth it a needful course
before we enter his forbidden gates
to know his pleasure and in that behalf
bold of your worthiness we single you
as our best-moving fair solicitor
tell him the daughter of the King of France
on serious business craving quick dispatch
importunes personal conference with his Grace
haste signify so much while we attend
like humble-visag'd suitors his high will

proud of employment willingly I go


who are the votaries my loving lords
that are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke

lord Longaville is one

know you the man

I know him madam at a marriage feast
between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
of Jacques Falconbridge solemnized
in Normandy saw I this Longaville
a man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd
well fitted in the arts glorious in arms
nothing becomes him ill that he would well
the only soil of his fair virtue's gloss
if virtue's gloss will stain with any soil
is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will
whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills

some merry mocking lord belike is't so

they say so most that most his humours know

such short-liv'd wits do wither as they grow
who are the rest

the young Dumaine a well-accomplish'd youth
of all that virtue love for virtue lov'd
most power to do most harm least knowing ill
for he hath wit to make an ill shape good
and shape to win grace though he had no wit
I saw him at the Duke Alen on's once
and much too little of that good I saw
is my report to his great worthiness

another of these students at that time
was there with him if I have heard a truth
within the limit of becoming mirth
I never spent an hour's talk withal
his eye begets occasion for his wit
for every object that the one doth catch
the other turns to a mirth-moving jest
which his fair tongue conceit's expositor
delivers in such apt and gracious words
that aged ears play truant at his tales
and younger hearings are quite ravished
so sweet and voluble is his discourse

God bless my ladies are they all in love
that every one her own hath garnished
with such bedecking ornaments of praise

here comes Boyet


now what admittance lord
Navarre had notice of your fair approach
and he and his competitors in oath
were all address'd to meet you gentle lady
before I came Marry thus much I have learnt
he rather means to lodge you in the field
like one that comes here to besiege his court
than seek a dispensation for his oath
to let you enter his unpeeled house
here comes Navarre

fair princess welcome to the court of Navarre

'Fair I give you back again and welcome' I have not yet the roof of this court is too high to be yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine

you shall be welcome madam to my court

I will be welcome then conduct me thither

hear me dear lady I have sworn an oath
our Lady help my lord he'll be forsworn

not for the world fair madam by my will

why will shall break it will and nothing else

your ladyship is ignorant what it is

were my lord so his ignorance were wise
where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord
and sin to break it
but pardon me I am too sudden-bold
to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
and suddenly resolve me in my suit



you will the sooner that I were away
for you'll prove perjur'd if you make me stay

did not I dance with you in Brabant once

did not I dance with you in Brabant once

I know you did

how needless was it then
to ask the question

you must not be so quick

'Tis long of you that spur me with such questions

your wit's too hot it speeds too fast twill tire


what time o' day

the hour that fools should ask

now fair befall your mask

fair fall the face it covers

and send you many lovers

amen so you be none

nay then I will be gone

madam your father here doth intimate
the payment of a hundred thousand crowns
being but the one half of an entire sum
disbursed by my father in his wars
receiv'd that sum yet there remains unpaid
a hundred thousand more in surety of the which
one part of Aquitaine is bound to us
although not valu'd to the money's worth
if then the king your father will restore
but that one half which is unsatisfied
we will give up our right in Aquitaine
and hold fair friendship with his majesty
but that it seems he little purposeth
for here he doth demand to have repaid
a hundred thousand crowns and not demands
on payment of a hundred thousand crowns
to have his title live in Aquitaine
which we much rather had depart withal
and have the money by our father lent
than Aquitaine so gelded as it is
dear princess were not his requests so far
from reason's yielding your fair self should make
a yielding gainst some reason in my breast

you do the king my father too much wrong
and wrong the reputation of your name
in so unseeming to confess receipt
of that which hath so faithfully been paid

I do protest I never heard of it
and if you prove it I'll repay it back
or yield up Aquitaine

we arrest your word
Boyet you can produce acquittances
for such a sum from special officers
of Charles his father

satisfy me so

so please your Grace the packet is not come
where that and other specialties are bound

it shall suffice me at which interview
all liberal reason I will yield unto
meantime receive such welcome at my hand
as honour without breach of honour may
make tender of to thy true worthiness
you may not come fair princess in my gates
but here without you shall be so receiv'd
as you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart
though so denied fair harbour in my house
your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
to-morrow shall we visit you again

sweet health and fair desires consort your Grace

thy own wish wish I thee in every place


lady I will commend you to mine own heart
pray you do my commendations I would be glad to see it

I would you heard it groan

is the fool sick

sick at the heart

alack let it blood

would that do it good

my physic says ay

will you prick't with your eye

no point with my knife

now God save thy life
and yours from long living

I cannot stay thanksgiving


sir I pray you a word what lady is that same

the heir of Alen on Katharine her name

a gallant lady Monsieur fare you well


I beseech you a word what is she in the white

a woman sometimes an you saw her in the light

perchance light in the light I desire her name

she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
pray you sir whose daughter

her mother's I have heard

God's blessing on your beard

good sir be not offended
she is an heir of Falconbridge

nay my choler is ended
she is a most sweet lady

not unlike sir that may be


what's her name in the cap

Rosaline by good hap


to her will sir or so

you are welcome sir Adieu

farewell to me sir and welcome to you


that last is Berowne the merry mad-cap lord
not a word with him but a jest

and every jest but a word

it was well done of you to take him at his word

I was as willing to grapple as he was to board

two hot sheeps marry

no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips

you sheep and I pasture shall that finish the jest

so you grant pasture for me


not so gentle beast
my lips are no common though several they be

belonging to whom

to my fortunes and me

good wits will be jangling but gentles agree
this civil war of wits were much better us'd
on Navarre and his book-men for here tis abus'd

if my observation which very seldom lies
deceive me not now Navarre is infected

with what

with that which we lovers entitle affected

your reason

why all his behaviours did make their retire
to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
his heart like an agate with your print impress'd
proud with his form in his eye pride express'd
his tongue all impatient to speak and not see
did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
all senses to that sense did make their repair
to feel only looking on fairest of fair
methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye
as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
who tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd
his face's own margent did quote such amazes
that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his
an' you give him for my sake but one loving kiss

come to our pavilion Boyet is dispos'd

but to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd
I only have made a mouth of his eye
by adding a tongue which I know will not he

thou art an old love-monger and speak'st skilfully

he is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him

then was Venus like her mother for her father is but grim

do you hear my mad wenches


what then do you see

ay our way to be gone

you are too hard for me

warble child make passionate my sense of hearing

concolinel

sweet air Go tenderness of years take this key give enlargement to the swain bring him festinately hither I must employ him in a letter to my love

master will you win your love with a French brawl

how meanest thou brawling in French

no my complete master but to jig off a tune at the tongue's end canary to it with your feet humour it with turning up your eyelids sigh a note and sing a note sometime through the throat as if you swallowed love by singing love sometime through the nose as if you snuffed up love by smelling love with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes with your arms crossed on your thin belly-doublet like a rabbit on a spit or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting and keep not too long in one tune but a snip and away These are complements these are humours these betray nice wenches that would be betrayed without these and make them men of note do you note me that most are affected to these


by my penny of observation

but O but O

'The hobby-horse is forgot

callest thou my love hobby-horse

no master the hobby-horse is but a colt and your love perhaps a hackney But have you forgot your love

almost I had

negligent student learn her by heart

by heart and in heart boy

and out of heart master all those three I will prove


a man if I live and this by in and without upon the instant by heart you love her because your heart cannot come by her in heart you love her because your heart is in love with her and out of heart you love her being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her

I am all these three

and three times as much more and yet nothing at all

fetch hither the swain he must carry me a letter

a message well sympathized a horse to be ambassador for an ass

ha ha what sayest thou

marry sir you must send the ass upon the horse for he is very slow-gaited But I go

the way is but short away

as swift as lead sir

is not lead a metal heavy dull and slow

minime honest master or rather master no

I say lead is slow

you are too swift sir to say so
is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun

sweet smoke of rhetoric
he reputes me a cannon and the bullet that's he
I shoot thee at the swain

thump then and I flee


a most acute juvenal volable and free of grace
by thy favour sweet welkin I must sigh in thy face
most rude melancholy valour gives thee place


a wonder master here's a costard broken in a shin

some enigma some riddle come thy l'envoy begin

no egma no riddle no l'envoy no salve in the mail sir O sir plantain a plain plantain no l'envoy no l'envoy no salve sir but a plantain

by virtue thou enforcest laughter thy silly thought my spleen the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling O pardon me my stars Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy and the word l'envoy for a salve

do the wise think them other is not l'envoy a salve

no page it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain
I will example it

the fox the ape and the humble-bee
were still at odds being but three


I will add the l'envoy Say the moral again


the fox the ape and the humble-bee
were still at odds being but three

until the goose came out of door
and stay'd the odds by adding four

now will I begin your moral and do you follow with my l'envoy

the fox the ape and the humble-bee
were still at odds being but three

until the goose came out of door
staying the odds by adding four


would you desire more

the boy hath sold him a bargain a goose that's flat
sir your pennyworth is good an your goose be fat
to sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose
let me see a fat l'envoy ay that's a fat goose

come hither come hither How did this argument begin

by saying that a costard was broken in a shin
then call'd you for the l'envoy

true and I for a plantain thus came your argument in
then the boy's fat l'envoy the goose that you bought
and he ended the market

but tell me how was there a costard broken in a shin

I will tell you sensibly
thou hast no feeling of it Moth I will speak that l'envoy
I Costard running out that was safely within
fell over the threshold and broke my shin

we will talk no more of this matter

till there be more matter in the shin

sirrah Costard I will enfranchise thee

O marry me to one Frances I smell some l'envoy some goose in this

by my sweet soul I mean setting thee at liberty enfreedoming thy person thou wert immured restrained captivated bound

true true and now you will be my purgation and let me loose

I give thee thy liberty set thee from durance and in lieu thereof impose upon thee nothing but this

bear this significant to the country maid Jaquenetta [Giving money ] There is remuneration for the best ward of mine honour is rewarding my dependents Moth follow

like the sequel I Signior Costard adieu

my sweet ounce of man's flesh my incony Jew

now will I look to his remuneration Remuneration O that's the Latin word for three farthings three farthings remuneration What's the price of this inkle One penny No I'll give you a remuneration why it carries it Remuneration why it is a fairer name than French crown I will never buy and sell out of this word


O my good knave Costard exceedingly well met

pray you sir how much carnation riband may a man buy for a remuneration

what is a remuneration

marry sir halfpenny farthing

why then three-farthing-worth of silk

I thank your worship God be wi' you

and in her train there is a gentle lady
when tongues speak sweetly then they name her name
and Rosaline they call her ask for her
and to her white hand see thou do commend
this seal'd-up counsel

there's thy guerdon go

gardon O sweet gardon better than remuneration a leven-pence farthing better
most sweet gardon I will do it sir in print
gardon remuneration


and I
forsooth in love I that have been love's whip
a very beadle to a humorous sigh
a critic nay a night-watch constable
a domineering pedant o'er the boy
than whom no mortal so magnificent
this senior-junior giant-dwarf Dan Cupid
regent of love-rimes lord of folded arms
the anointed sovereign of sighs and groans
liege of all loiterers and malecontents
dread prince of plackets king of codpieces
sole imperator and great general
of trotting paritors O my little heart
and I to be a corporal of his field
and wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop
what I I love I sue I seek a wife
a woman that is like a German clock
still a-repairing ever out of frame
and never going aright being a watch
but being watch'd that it may still go right
nay to be perjur'd which is worst of all
and among three to love the worst of all
a wightly wanton with a velvet brow
with two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes
ay and by heaven one that will do the deed
and I to sigh for her to watch for her
to pray for her Go to it is a plague
that Cupid will impose for my neglect
of his almighty dreadful little might
well I will love write sigh pray sue and groan
some men must love my lady and some Joan

was that the king that spurr'd his horse so hard
against the steep uprising of the hill

I know not but I think it was not he

whoe'er a' was a' show'd a mounting mind
well lords to-day we shall have our dispatch
on Saturday we will return to France
then forester my friend where is the bush
that we must stand and play the murderer in

hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice

I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot
and thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot

pardon me madam for I meant not so

what what first praise me and again say no
O short-liv'd pride Not fair alack for woe

yes madam fair

nay never paint me now
where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
here good my glass

take this for telling true
fair payment for foul words is more than due

nothing but fair is that which you inherit
see see my beauty will be sav'd by merit
O heresy in fair fit for these days
a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
but come the bow now mercy goes to kill
and shooting well is then accounted ill
thus will I save my credit in the shoot
not wounding pity would not let me do't
if wounding then it was to show my skill
that more for praise than purpose meant to kill
and out of question so it is sometimes
glory grows guilty of detested crimes
when for fame's sake for praise an outward part
we bend to that the working of the heart
as I for praise alone now seek to spill
the poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill

do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
only for praise' sake when they strive to be
lords o'er their lords
only for praise and praise we may afford
to any lady that subdues a lord


here comes a member of the commonwealth

God dig-you-den all Pray you which is the head lady

thou shalt know her fellow by the rest that have no heads

which is the greatest lady the highest

the thickest and the tallest

the thickest and the tallest it is so truth is truth
an your waist mistress were as slender as my wit
one o'these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit
are not you the chief woman you are the thickest here


I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one Lady Rosaline

O thy letter thy letter he's a good friend of mine
stand aside good bearer Boyet you can carve
break up this capon

I am bound to serve
this letter is mistook it importeth none here
it is writ to Jaquenetta

we will read it I swear
break the neck of the wax and every one give ear

by heaven that thou art fair is most infallible true that thou art beauteous truth itself that thou art lovely More fairer than fair beautiful than beauteous truer than truth itself have commiseration on thy heroical vassal The magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon and he it was that might rightly say veni vidi vici which to anatomize in the vulgar O base and obscure vulgar videlicet he came saw and overcame he came one saw two overcame three Who came the king Why did he come to see Why did he see to overcome To whom came he to the beggar What saw he the beggar Whom overcame he the beggar The conclusion is victory on whose side the king's the captive is enriched on whose side the beggar's The catastrophe is a nuptial on whose side the king's no on both in one or one in both I am the king for so stands the comparison thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness Shall I command thy love I may Shall I enforce thy love I could Shall I entreat thy love I will What shalt thou exchange for rags robes for tittles titles for thyself me Thus expecting thy reply I profane my lips on thy foot my eyes on thy picture and my heart on thy every part
thine in the dearest design of Industry DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee thou lamb that standest as his prey
submissive fall his princely feet before
but if thou strive poor soul what art thou then
food for his rage repasture for his den

what plume of feathers is he that indited this letter
what vane what weathercock did you ever hear better

I am much deceiv'd but I remember the style

else your memory is bad going o'er it erewhile

this Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court
a phantasime a Monarcho and one that makes sport
to the prince and his book-mates

thou fellow a word
who gave thee this letter

I told you my lord


from my lord to my lady

from which lord to which lady

from my lord Berowne a good master of mine
to a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline

thou hast mistaken his letter Come lords away
here sweet put up this twill be thine another day


who is the suitor who is the suitor

shall I teach you to know

ay my continent of beauty

why she that bears the bow

my lady goes to kill horns but if thou marry
hang me by the neck if horns that year miscarry
finely put on

well then I am the shooter

and who is your deer

if we choose by the horns yourself come not near
finely put on indeed

you still wrangle with her Boyet and she strikes at the brow

but she herself is hit lower have I hit her now

shall I come upon thee with an old saying that was a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy as touching the hit it

so may I answer thee with one as old that was a woman when Queen Guinever of Britain was a little wench as touching the hit it

thou canst not hit it hit it hit it
thou canst not hit it my good man

an I cannot cannot cannot
an I cannot another can

by my troth most pleasant how both did fit it

a mark marvellous well shot for they both did hit it

a mark O mark but that mark a mark says my lady
let the mark have a prick in't to mete at if it may be

wide o' the bow hand i' faith your hand is out

indeed a' must shoot nearer or he'll ne'er hit the clout

an' if my hand be out then belike your hand is in
then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin

come come you talk greasily your lips grow foul

she's too hard for you at pricks sir challenge her to bowl

I fear too much rubbing Good night my good owl


by my soul a swain a most simple clown
lord lord how the ladies and I have put him down
o' my troth most sweet jests most incony vulgar wit
when it comes so smoothly off so obscenely as it were so fit
Armado o' the one side O a most dainty man
to see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan
to see him kiss his hand and how most sweetly a' will swear
and his page o' t'other side that handful of wit
Ah heavens it is a most pathetical nit

sola sola


very reverend sport truly and done in the testimony of a good conscience

the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe as a pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of c lo the sky the welkin the heaven and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra the soil the land the earth

truly Master Holofernes the epithets are sweetly varied like a scholar at the least but sir I assure ye it was a buck of the first head

sir Nathaniel haud credo

'Twas not a haud credo twas a pricket

most barbarous intimation yet a kind of insinuation as it were in via in way of explication facere as it were replication or rather ostentare to show as it were his inclination after his undressed unpolished uneducated unpruned untrained or rather unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to insert again my haud credo for a deer

I said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket

twice sod simplicity bis coctus
O thou monster Ignorance how deformed dost thou look
sir he hath not fed of the dainties that are bred of a book
he hath not eat paper as it were he hath not drunk ink his intellect is not replenished he is only an animal only sensible in the duller parts
and such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be
which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that do fructify in us more than he
for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school
but omne bene say I being of an old Father's mind
many can brook the weather that love not the wind

you two are book-men can you tell by your wit
what was a month old at Cain's birth that's not five weeks old as yet

Dictynna goodman Dull Dictynna goodman Dull

what is Dictynna

a title to Ph be to Luna to the moon

the moon was a month old when Adam was no more
the allusion holds in the exchange

'Tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange

God comfort thy capacity I say the allusion holds in the exchange

and I say the pollusion holds in the exchange for the moon is never but a month old and I say beside that twas a pricket that the princess killed

sir Nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer and to humour the ignorant I have call'd the deer the princess killed a pricket

perge good Master Holofernes perge so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility

I will something affect the letter for it argues facility

the preyful princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing pricket
some say a sore but not a sore till now made sore with shooting
the dogs did yell put l to sore then sorel jumps from thicket
or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall a hooting
if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores one sorel


a rare talent

if a talent be a claw look how he claws him with a talent

this is a gift that I have simple simple a foolish extravagant spirit full of forms figures shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions revolutions these are begot in the ventricle of memory nourished in the womb of pia mater and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute and I am thankful for it

sir I praise the Lord for you and so may my parishioners for their sons are well tutored by you and their daughters profit very greatly under you you are a good member of the commonwealth

mehercle if their sons be ingenuous they shall want no instruction if their daughters be capable I will put it to them But vir sapit qui pauca loquitur A soul feminine saluteth us


God give you good morrow Master parson

master parson quasi pers-on An if one should be pierced which is the one

marry Master schoolmaster he that is likest to a hogshead


good Master parson

be so good as read me this letter it was given me by Costard and sent me from Don Armado I beseech you read it

fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra Ruminat and so forth Ah good old Mantuan I may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice

Venetia Venetia
chi non te vede non te pretia

old Mantuan old Mantuan Who understandeth thee not loves thee not Ut re sol la mi fa Under pardon sir what are the contents or rather as Horace says in his What my soul verses

ay sir and very learned

let me hear a staff a stanze a verse lege domine


if love make me forsworn how shall I swear to love
Ah never faith could hold if not to beauty vow'd
those thoughts to me were oaks to thee like osiers bow'd
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend
if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire
thy eye Jove's lightning bears thy voice his dreadful thunder
which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
celestial as thou art O pardon love this wrong
that sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue


you find not the apostrophas and so miss the accent let me supervise the canzonet Here are only numbers ratified but for the elegancy facility and golden cadence of poesy caret Ovidius Naso was the man and why indeed Naso but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy the jerks of invention Imitari is nothing so doth the hound his master the ape his keeper the tired horse his rider But damosella virgin was this directed to you

ay sir from one Monsieur Berowne one of the strange queen's lords

I will overglance the superscript To the snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline I will look again on the intellect of the letter for the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto Your ladyship's in all desired employment

good Costard go with me Sir God save your life

have with thee my girl


sir you have done this in the fear of God very religiously and as a certain Father saith

sir tell not me of the Father I do fear colourable colours But to return to the verses did they please you Sir Nathaniel

marvellous well for the pen

I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil of mine where if before repast it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace I will on my privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid child or pupil undertake your ben venuto where I will prove those verses to be very unlearned neither savouring of poetry wit nor invention I beseech your society

and thank you too for society saith the text is the happiness of life

and certes the text most infallibly concludes it [To

the king he is hunting the deer I am coursing myself they have pitched a toil I am toiling in a pitch pitch that defiles defile a foul word Well sit thee down sorrow for so they say the fool said and so say I and I the fool well proved wit By the Lord this love is as mad as Ajax it kills sheep it kills me I a sheep well proved again o' my side I will not love if I do hang me i' faith I will not O but her eye by this light but for her eye I would not love her yes for her two eyes Well I do nothing in the world but lie and lie in my throat By heaven I do love and it hath taught me to rime and to be melancholy and here is part of my rime and here my melancholy Well she hath one o' my sonnets already the clown bore it the fool sent it and the lady hath it sweet clown sweeter fool sweetest lady By the world I would not care a pin if the other three were in Here comes one with a paper God give him grace to groan


shot by heaven Proceed sweet Cupid thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the left pap In faith secrets


so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
to those fresh morning drops upon the rose
as thy eye-beams when their fresh rays have smote
the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
through the transparent bosom of the deep
as doth thy face through tears of mine give light
thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep
no drop but as a coach doth carry thee
so ridest thou triumphing in my woe
do but behold the tears that swell in me
and they thy glory through my grief will show
but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
my tears for glasses and still make me weep
O queen of queens how far thou dost excel

how shall she know my griefs I'll drop the paper
sweet leaves shade folly Who is he comes here

what Longaville and reading listen ear


now in thy likeness one more fool appear

ay me I am forsworn

why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers

in love I hope sweet fellowship in shame

one drunkard loves another of the name

am I the first that have been perjur'd so

thou mak'st the triumviry the corner-cap of society
the shape of love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity

I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
O sweet Maria empress of my love
these numbers will I tear and write in prose

O rimes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose
disfigure not his slop

this same shall go

did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument
persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman I forswore but I will prove
thou being a goddess I forswore not thee
my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
exhal'st this vapour-vow in thee it is
if broken then it is no fault of mine
if by me broke what fool is not so wise
to lose an oath to win a paradise


this is the liver-vein which makes flesh a deity
a green goose a goddess pure pure idolatry
God amend us God amend we are much out o' the way

by whom shall I send this Company stay


all hid all hid an old infant play
like a demi-god here sit I in the sky
and wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'er-eye
more sacks to the mill O heavens I have my wish
Dumaine transform'd four woodcocks in a dish

O most divine Kate

O most profane coxcomb

by heaven the wonder of a mortal eye

by earth she is but corporal there you lie

her amber hairs for foul have amber quoted

an amber-colour'd raven was well noted

as upright as the cedar

stoop I say
her shoulder is with child


ay as some days but then no sun must shine

O that I had my wish

and I had mine

and I mine too good Lord

amen so I had mine Is not that a good word

I would forget her but a fever she
reigns in my blood and will remember'd be

a fever in your blood why then incision
would let her out in saucers sweet misprision

once more I'll read the ode that I have writ



on a day alack the day
love whose month is ever May
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen gan passage find
that the lover sick to death
wish'd himself the heaven's breath
air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would I might triumph so
but alack my hand is sworn
ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
youth so apt to pluck a sweet
do not call it sin in me
that I am forsworn for thee
thou for whom e'en Jove would swear
and deny himself for Jove
turning mortal for thy love

this will I send and something else more plain
that shall express my true love's fasting pain
O would the King Berowne and Longaville
were lovers too Ill to example ill
would from my forehead wipe a perjur'd note
for none offend where all alike do dote

Dumaine thy love is far from charity
that in love's grief desir'st society
you may look pale but I should blush I know
to be o'erheard and taken napping so

come sir you blush as his your case is such
you chide at him offending twice as much
you do not love Maria Longaville
did never sonnet for her sake compile
his loving bosom to keep down his heart
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
and mark'd you both and for you both did blush
I heard your guilty rimes observ'd your fashion
saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
ay me says one O Jove the other cries
one her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes


you would for paradise break faith and troth


and Jove for your love would infringe an oath
what will Berowne say when that he shall hear
a faith infringed which such zeal did swear
how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
for all the wealth that ever I did see
I would not have him know so much by me
now step I forth to whip hypocrisy

Ah good my liege I pray thee pardon me
good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
these worms for loving that art most in love
your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
there is no certain princess that appears
you'll not be perjur'd tis a hateful thing
tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
but are you not asham'd nay are you not
all three of you to be thus much o'ershot
you found his mote the king your mote did see
but I a beam do find in each of three
O what a scene of foolery have I seen
of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
O me with what strict patience have I sat
to see a king transformed to a gnat
to see great Hercules whipping a gig
and profound Solomon to tune a jig
and critic Timon laugh at idle toys
where lies thy grief O tell me good Dumaine
and gentle Longaville where lies thy pain
and where my liege's all about the breast
a caudle ho

too bitter is thy jest
are we betray'd thus to thy over-view

not you to me but I betray'd by you
I that am honest I that hold it sin
to break the vow I am engaged in
I am betray'd by keeping company
with men like men men of inconstancy
when shall you see me write a thing in rime
or groan for Joan or spend a minute's time
in pruning me When shall you hear that I
will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
a gait a state a brow a breast a waist leg a limb
soft Whither away so fast true man or a thief that gallops so

I post from love good lover let me go


God bless the king

what present hast thou there

some certain treason

what makes treason here

nay it makes nothing sir

if it mar nothing neither
the treason and you go in peace away together

I beseech your Grace let this letter be read

Berowne read it over

there hadst thou it

of Costard

where hadst thou it

of Dun Adramadio Dun Adramadio


how now what is in you why dost thou tear it

a toy my liege a toy your Grace needs not fear it

it did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it

it is Berowne's writing and here is his name
Ah you whoreson logger-head you were born to do me shame
guilty my lord guilty I confess I confess

what

that you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess
he he and you and you my liege and I
are pick-purses in love and we deserve to die
O dismiss this audience and I shall tell you more

now the number is even

true true we are four
will these turtles be gone

hence sirs away

walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay

sweet lords sweet lovers O let us embrace
as true we are as flesh and blood can be
the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
young blood doth not obey an old decree
we cannot cross the cause why we were born
therefore of all hands must we be forsworn

what did these rent lines show some love of thine

'Did they quoth you Who sees the heavenly Rosaline
that like a rude and savage man of Inde
at the first opening of the gorgeous east
bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
kisses the base ground with obedient breast
what peremptory eagle-sighted eye
dares look upon the heaven of her brow
that is not blinded by her majesty

what zeal what fury hath inspir'd thee now
she an attending star scarce seen a light

my eyes are then no eyes nor I Berowne
O but for my love day would turn to night
of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
where several worthies make one dignity
where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
fie painted rhetoric O she needs it not
to things of sale a seller's praise belongs
she passes praise then praise too short doth blot
a wither'd hermit five-score winters worn
might shake off fifty looking in her eye
beauty doth varnish age as if new-born
and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy
O tis the sun that maketh all things shine

by heaven thy love is black as ebony
is ebony like her O wood divine
a wife of such wood were felicity
O who can give an oath where is a book
that I may swear beauty doth beauty lack
if that she learn not of her eye to look
no face is fair that is not full so black

O paradox Black is the badge of hell
the hue of dungeons and the scowl of night
and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well

devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
O if in black my lady's brows be deck'd
it mourns that painting and usurping hair
should ravish doters with a false aspect
and therefore is she born to make black fair
her favour turns the fashion of the days
for native blood is counted painting now
and therefore red that would avoid dispraise

to look like her are chimney-sweepers black

and since her time are colliers counted bright

and Ethiops of their sweet complexion crack

dark needs no candles now for dark is light

your mistresses dare never come in rain
for fear their colours should be wash'd away

'Twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day

I'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here

no devil will fright thee then so much as she


look here's thy love

my foot and her face see

O if the streets were paved with thine eyes
her feet were much too dainty for such tread

O vile then as she goes what upward lies
the street should see as she walk'd over head

but what of this Are we not all in love

nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn

then leave this chat and good Berowne now prove
our loving lawful and our faith not torn

ay marry there some flattery for this evil
O some authority how to proceed
some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil

some salve for perjury

O tis more than need
have at you then affection's men-at-arms
consider what you first did swear unto
to fast to study and to see no woman
flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth
say can you fast your stomachs are too young
and abstinence engenders maladies
and where that you have vow'd to study lords
in that each of you hath forsworn his book
can you still dream and pore and thereon look
for when would you my lord or you or you
have found the ground of study's excellence
without the beauty of a woman's face
from women's eyes this doctrine I derive
from whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
why universal plodding poisons up
the nimble spirits in the arteries
as motion and long-during action tires
the sinewy vigour of the traveller
now for not looking on a woman's face
you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
and study too the causer of your vow
for where is any author in the world
teaches such beauty as a woman's eye
learning is but an adjunct to ourself
and where we are our learning likewise is
then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes
do we not likewise see our learning there
O we have made a vow to study lords
and in that vow we have forsworn our books
for when would you my liege or you or you
in leaden contemplation have found out
such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
other slow arts entirely keep the brain
and therefore finding barren practisers
scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
but love first learned in a lady's eyes
lives not alone immured in the brain
but with the motion of all elements
courses as swift as thought in every power
and gives to every power a double power
above their functions and their offices
it adds a precious seeing to the eye
a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind
a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound
when the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd
love's feeling is more soft and sensible
than are the tender horns of cockled snails
love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste
for valour is not Love a Hercules
still climbing trees in the Hesperides
subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical
and when Love speaks the voice of all the gods
makes heaven drowsy with the harmony
never durst poet touch a pen to write
until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs
O then his lines would ravish savage ears
and plant in tyrants mild humility
from women's eyes this doctrine I derive
they sparkle still the right Promethean fire
they are the books the arts the academes
that show contain and nourish all the world
else none at all in aught proves excellent
then fools you were these women to forswear
or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
for wisdom's sake a word that all men love
or for love's sake a word that loves all men
or for men's sake the authors of these women
or women's sake by whom we men are men
let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
for charity itself fulfils the law
and who can sever love from charity

Saint Cupid then and soldiers to the field

advance your standards and upon them lords
pell-mell down with them but be first advis'd
in conflict that you get the sun of them

now to plain-dealing lay these glozes by
shall we resolve to woo these girls of France

and win them too therefore let us devise
some entertainment for them in their tents

first from the park let us conduct them thither
then homeward every man attach the hand
of his fair mistress in the afternoon
we will with some strange pastime solace them
for revels dances masks and merry hours
forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowers

away away no time shall be omitted
that will betime and may by us be fitted

allons allons Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn
and justice always whirls in equal measure
light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
if so our copper buys no better treasure

satis quod sufficit

I praise God for you sir your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious pleasant without scurrility witty without affection audacious without impudency learned without opinion and strange without heresy I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the king's who is intituled nominated or called Don Adriano de Armado

novi hominem tanquam te his humour is lofty his discourse peremptory his tongue field his eye ambitious his gait majestical and his general behaviour vain ridiculous and thrasonical He is too picked too spruce too affected too odd as it were too peregrinate as I may call it

a most singular and choice epithet

he draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument I abhor such fanatical phantasimes such insociable and point-devise companions such rackers of orthography as to speak dout fine when he should say doubt det when he should pronounce debt d e b t not d e t he clepeth a calf cauf half hauf neighbour vocatur nebour neigh abbreviated ne This is abhominable which he would call abominable it insinuateth me of insanie anne intelligis domine To make frantic lunatic

O I smell false Latin dunghill for unguem

arts-man pr ambula we will be singled from the barbarous Do you not educate youth at the charge-house on the top of the mountain


at your sweet pleasure for the mountain

I do sans question

sir it is the king's most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day which the rude multitude call the afternoon

the posterior of the day most generous sir is liable congruent and measurable for the afternoon the word is well culled chose sweet and apt I do assure you sir I do assure

sir the king is a noble gentleman and my familiar I do assure ye very good friend For what is inward between us let it pass I do beseech thee remember thy curtsy I beseech thee apparel thy head and among other importunate and most serious designs and of great import indeed too but let that pass for I must tell thee it will please his Grace by the world sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally with my excrement with my mustachio but sweet heart let that pass By the world I recount no fable some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart to Armado a soldier a man of travel that hath seen the world but let that pass The very all of all is but sweet heart I do implore secrecy that the king would have me present the princess sweet chuck with some delightful ostentation or show or pageant or antick or fire-work Now understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth as it were I have acquainted you withal to the end to crave your assistance

sir you shall present before her the Nine Worthies Sir Nathaniel as concerning some entertainment of time some show in the posterior of this day to be rendered by our assistance at the king's command and this most gallant illustrate and learned gentleman before the princess I say none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies

where will you find men worthy enough to present them

joshua yourself myself or this gallant gentleman Judas Maccab us this swain because of his great limb or joint shall pass Pompey the Great the page Hercules

pardon sir error he is not quantity enough for that Worthy's thumb he is not so big as the end of his club


an excellent device so if any of the audience hiss you may cry Well done Hercules now thou crushest the snake that is the way to make an offence gracious though few have the grace to do it

for the rest of the Worthies

I will play three myself

thrice-worthy gentleman

shall I tell you a thing

we attend

we will have if this fadge not an antick I beseech you follow

Via goodman Dull thou hast spoken no word all this while

nor understood none neither sir


I'll make one in a dance or so or I will play the tabor to the Worthies and let them dance the hay

most dull honest Dull to our sport away


sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
if fairings come thus plentifully in lady wall'd about with diamonds
look you what I have from the loving king

madam came nothing else along with that

nothing but this yes as much love in rime
as would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
writ o' both sides the leaf margent and all
that he was fain to seal on Cupid's name

that was the way to make his godhead wax
for he hath been five thousand years a boy
ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too

you'll ne'er be friends with him a' kill'd your sister

he made her melancholy sad and heavy
and so she died had she been light like you
of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
she might ha' been a grandam ere she died
and so may you for a light heart lives long

what's your dark meaning mouse of this light word

a light condition in a beauty dark

we need more light to find your meaning out

you'll mar the light by taking it in snuff
therefore I'll darkly end the argument


so do not you for you are a light wench

indeed I weigh not you and therefore light

you weigh me not O that's you care not for me

great reason for past cure is still past care

well bandied both a set of wit well play'd
but Rosaline you have a favour too
who sent it and what is it

I would you knew
an if my face were but as fair as yours
my favour were as great be witness this
nay I have verses too I thank Berowne
the numbers true and were the numb'ring too
I were the fairest goddess on the ground
O he hath drawn my picture in his letter

anything like

much in the letters nothing in the praise

beauteous as ink a good conclusion

fair as a text B in a copy-book

'Ware pencils how let me not die your debtor
my red dominical my golden letter
O that your face were not so full of O's

a pox of that jest and beshrew all shrows

but what was sent to you from fair Dumaine

madam this glove
did he not send you twain

yes madam and moreover
some thousand verses of a faithful lover
a huge translation of hypocrisy
vilely compil'd profound simplicity

this and these pearls to me sent Longaville
the letter is too long by half a mile

I think no less Dost thou not wish in heart
the chain were longer and the letter short

ay or I would these hands might never part

we are wise girls to mock our lovers so

they are worse fools to purchase mocking so
that same Berowne I'll torture ere I go
how I would make him fawn and beg and seek
and wait the season and observe the times
and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rimes
and shape his service wholly to my hests
and make him proud to make me proud that jests
so perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
that he should be my fool and I his fate

none are so surely caught when they are catch'd
as wit turn'd fool folly in wisdom hatch'd
hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
and wit's own grace to grace a learned fool

the blood of youth burns not with such excess
as gravity's revolt to wantonness

folly in fools bears not so strong a note
as foolery in the wise when wit doth dote
since all the power thereof it doth apply


here comes Boyet and mirth is in his face

O I am stabb'd with laughter Where's her Grace

thy news Boyet

prepare madam prepare
arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
against your peace Love doth approach disguis'd
armed in arguments you'll be surpris'd
muster your wits stand in your own defence
or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence

Saint Denis to Saint Cupid What are they
that charge their breath against us say scout say

under the cool shade of a sycamore
when lo to interrupt my purpos'd rest
toward that shade I might behold addrest
the king and his companions warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by
and overheard what you shall overhear
that by and by disguis'd they will be here
their herald is a pretty knavish page
that well by heart hath conn'd his embassage
action and accent did they teach him there
'Thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear
and ever and anon they made a doubt
presence majestical would put him out
'For quoth the king an angel shalt thou see
yet fear not thou but speak audaciously
the boy replied An angel is not evil
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil
with that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder
making the bold wag by their praises bolder
one rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore
another with his finger and his thumb
cry'd Via we will do't come what will come
the third he caper'd and cried All goes well
the fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell
with that they all did tumble on the ground
with such a zealous laughter so profound
that in this spleen ridiculous appears
to check their folly passion's solemn tears

but what but what come they to visit us

they do they do and are apparell'd thus
like Muscovites or Russians as I guess
their purpose is to parle to court and dance
and every one his love-feat will advance
unto his several mistress which they'll know
by favours several which they did bestow

and will they so the gallants shall be task'd
and not a man of them shall have the grace
despite of suit to see a lady's face
hold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
and then the king will court thee for his dear
hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
so shall Berowne take me for Rosaline
and change you favours too so shall your loves
woo contrary deceiv'd by these removes

come on then wear the favours most in sight

but in this changing what is your intent

the effect of my intent is to cross theirs
they do it but in mocking merriment
and mock for mock is only my intent
their several counsels they unbosom shall
to loves mistook and so be mock'd withal
upon the next occasion that we meet

but shall we dance if they desire us to't

no to the death we will not move a foot
nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace
but while tis spoke each turn away her face

why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart
and quite divorce his memory from his part

therefore I do it and I make no doubt
the rest will ne'er come in if he be out
there's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown
to make theirs ours and ours none but our own
so shall we stay mocking intended game
and they well mock'd depart away with shame


the trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come

all hail the richest beauties on the earth

beauties no richer than rich taffeta

a holy parcel of the fairest dames

that ever turn'd their backs to mortal views

'Their eyes villain their eyes

that ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views
out

true out indeed

'Out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
not to behold'


'Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes
with your sun-beamed eyes'

they will not answer to that epithet
you were best call it daughter-beamed eyes

they do not mark me and that brings me out

is this your perfectness be gone you rogue


what would these strangers know their minds Boyet
if they do speak our language tis our will
that some plain man recount their purposes
know what they would

what would you with the princess


what would they say they

nothing but peace and gentle visitation

why that they have and bid them so be gone

she says you have it and you may be gone

say to her we have measur'd many miles
to tread a measure with her on this grass

they say that they have measur'd many a mile
to tread a measure with you on this grass

it is not so Ask them how many inches
is in one mile if they have measur'd many
the measure then of one is easily told

and many miles the princess bids you tell
how many inches do fill up one mile

tell her we measure them by weary steps

she hears herself

how many weary steps
of many weary miles you have o'ergone
are number'd in the travel of one mile

we number nothing that we spend for you
our duty is so rich so infinite
that we may do it still without accompt
vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
that we like savages may worship it

my face is but a moon and clouded too

vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
those clouds remov'd upon our wat'ry eyne

O vain petitioner beg a greater matter
thou now request'st but moonshine in the water

then in our measure but vouchsafe one change
thou bid'st me beg this begging is not strange

play music then Nay you must do it soon

not yet no dance thus change I like the moon

will you not dance How come you thus estrang'd

you took the moon at full but now she's chang'd

yet still she is the moon and I the man
the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
our ears vouchsafe it

but your legs should do it

since you are strangers and come here by chance
we'll not be nice take hands we will not dance

why take we hands then

only to part friends
curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends

more measure of this measure be not nice

we can afford no more at such a price

prize you yourselves what buys your company

your absence only
that can never be

then cannot we be bought and so adieu
twice to your visor and half once to you

if you deny to dance let's hold more chat

in private then

I am best pleas'd with that


white-handed mistress one sweet word with thee

honey and milk and sugar there are three

nay then two treys an if you grow so nice
metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice
there's half a dozen sweets
seventh sweet adieu
since you can cog I'll play no more with you

one word in secret

let it not be sweet

thou griev'st my gall

gall bitter

therefore meet


will you vouchsafe with me to change a word

name it

fair lady
say you so Fair lord
take that for your fair lady

please it you
as much in private and I'll bid adieu


what was your visor made without a tongue

I know the reason lady why you ask

O for your reason quickly sir I long

you have a double tongue within your mask
and would afford my speechless visor half

'Veal quoth the Dutchman Is not veal' a calf

a calf fair lady
no a fair lord calf

let's part the word

no I'll not be your half
take all and wean it it may prove an ox

look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
will you give horns chaste lady do not so

then die a calf before your horns do grow

one word in private with you ere I die

bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry


the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
as is the razor's edge invisible
above the sense of sense so sensible
seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things

not one word more my maids break off break off

by heaven all dry-beaten with pure scoff

farewell mad wenches you have simple wits

twenty adieus my frozen Muscovits

are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at

tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out

well-liking wits they have gross gross fat fat

O poverty in wit kingly-poor flout
or ever but in visors show their faces
this pert Berowne was out of countenance quite

O they were all in lamentable cases
the king was weeping-ripe for a good word

Berowne did swear himself out of all suit

Dumaine was at my service and his sword
'No point quoth I my servant straight was mute

lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart
and trow you what he call'd me

qualm perhaps

yes in good faith

go sickness as thou art
well better wits have worn plain statutecaps
but will you hear the king is my love sworn

and quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me

and Longaville was for my service born

Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree

madam and pretty mistresses give ear
immediately they will again be here
in their own shapes for it can never be
they will digest this harsh indignity

will they return

they will they will God knows
and leap for joy though they are lame with blows
therefore change favours and when they repair

how blow how blow speak to be understood

fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud
dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown
are angels vailing clouds or roses blown

avaunt perplexity What shall we do
if they return in their own shapes to woo

good madam if by me you'll be advis'd
let's mock them still as well known as disguis'd
let us complain to them what fools were here
disguis'd like Muscovites in shapeless gear
and wonder what they were and to what end
their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
and their rough carriage so ridiculous
should be presented at our tent to us


whip to your tents as roes run over land

fair sir God save you Where is the princess

gone to her tent Please it your majesty
command me any service to her thither

that she vouchsafe me audience for one word

I will and so will she I know my lord


this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
and utters it again when God doth please
he is wit's pedlar and retails his wares
at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
and we that sell by gross the Lord doth know
have not the grace to grace it with such show
had he been Adam he had tempted Eve
he can carve too and lisp why this is he
that kiss'd his hand away in courtesy
this is the ape of form monsieur the nice
that when he plays at tables chides the dice
in honourable terms nay he can sing
a mean most meanly and in ushering
mend him who can the ladies call him sweet
the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
this is the flower that smiles on every one
to show his teeth as white as whales-bone
and consciences that will not die in debt
pay him the due of honey-tongu'd Boyet

a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
that put Armado's page out of his part


see where it comes Behaviour what wert thou

all hail sweet madam and fair time of day

'Fair in all hail is foul as I conceive

construe my speeches better if you may

then wish me better I will give you leave

we came to visit you and purpose now
to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then

this field shall hold me and so hold your vow
nor God nor I delights in perjur'd men

rebuke me not for that which you provoke
the virtue of your eye must break my oath

you nick-name virtue vice you should have spoke
now by my maiden honour yet as pure
as the unsullied lily I protest
a world of torments though I should endure
I would not yield to be your house's guest
so much I hate a breaking cause to be
of heavenly oaths vow'd with integrity

O you have liv'd in desolation here
unseen unvisited much to our shame

not so my lord it is not so I swear
we have had pastime here and pleasant game
a mess of Russians left us but of late

how madam Russians

ay in truth my lord
trim gallants full of courtship and of state

my lady to the manner of the days
in courtesy gives undeserving praise
we four indeed confronted were with four
in Russian habit here they stay'd an hour
and talk'd apace and in that hour my lord
they did not bless us with one happy word
I dare not call them fools but this I think
when they are thirsty fools would fam have drink

this jest is dry to me Fair gentle sweet
your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
with eyes best seeing heaven's fiery eye
by light we lose light your capacity
is of that nature that to your huge store
wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor

this proves you wise and rich for in my eye

I am a fool and full of poverty
but that you take what doth to you belong
it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue

O I am yours and all that I possess

all the fool mine

I cannot give you less

which of the visors was it that you wore

where when what visor why demand you this

there then that visor that superfluous case
that hid the worse and show'd the better face

we are descried they'll mock us now downright

let us confess and turn it to a jest
amaz'd my lord Why looks your highness sad

help hold his brows he'll swound
why look you pale
sea-sick I think coming from Muscovy

thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
can any face of brass hold longer out
here stand I lady dart thy skill at me
bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
and I will wish thee never more to dance
nor never more in Russian habit wait
O never will I trust to speeches penn'd
nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue
nor never come in visor to my friend
nor woo in rime like a blind harper's song
taffeta phrases silken terms precise
figures pedantical these summer flies
have blown me full of maggot ostentation
I do forswear them and I here protest
by this white glove how white the hand
God knows
henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
in russet yeas and honest kersey noes
and to begin wench so God help me la
my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw

sans sans I pray you

yet I have a trick
of the old rage bear with me I am sick
I'll leave it by degrees Soft let us see
write Lord have mercy on us' on those three
they are infected in their hearts it lies
they have the plague and caught it of your eyes
these lords are visited you are not free

no they are free that gave these tokens to us

our states are forfeit seek not to undo us

it is not so For how can this be true
that you stand forfeit being those that sue

peace for I will not have to do with you

nor shall not if I do as I intend

speak for yourselves my wit is at an end

teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
some fair excuse

the fairest is confession
were you not here but even now disguis'd
madam I was

and were you well advis'd

I was fair madam

when you then were here
what did you whisper in your lady's ear

that more than all the world I did respect her

when she shall challenge this you will reject her

upon mine honour no

peace peace forbear
your oath once broke you force not to forswear

despise me when I break this oath of mine
I will and therefore keep it Rosaline
what did the Russian whisper in your ear

madam he swore that he did hold me dear
as precious eyesight and did value me
above this world adding thereto moreover
that he would wed me or else die my lover

God give thee joy of him the noble lord
most honourably doth uphold his word

what mean you madam by my life my troth
I never swore this lady such an oath

by heaven you did and to confirm it plain
you gave me this but take it sir again

my faith and this the princess I did give
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
and Lord Berowne I thank him is my dear
what will you have me or your pearl again

neither of either I remit both twain
I see the trick on't here was a consent
knowing aforehand of our merriment
to dash it like a Christmas comedy
some carry-tale some please-man some slight zany
some mumble-news some trencher-knight some Dick
that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
to make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd
told our intents before which once disclos'd
the ladies did change favours and then we
following the signs woo'd but the sign of she
now to our perjury to add more terror
we are again forsworn in will and error
much upon this it is

forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
do not you know my lady's foot by the squire
and laugh upon the apple of her eye
and stand between her back sir and the fire
holding a trencher jesting merrily
you put our page out go you are allow'd
die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
you leer upon me do you there's an eye
wounds like a leaden sword

full merrily
hath this brave manage this career been run

lo he is tilting straight Peace I have done

welcome pure wit thou partest a fair fray

O Lord sir they would know
whether the three Worthies shall come in or no
what are there but three

no sir but it is vara fine
for every one pursents three

and three times thrice is nine

not so sir under correction sir I hope it is not so
you cannot beg us sir I can assure you sir we know what we know
I hope sir three times thrice sir

is not nine

under correction sir we know whereuntil it doth amount

by Jove I always took three threes for nine

O Lord sir it were pity you should get your living by reckoning sir


O Lord sir the parties themselves the actors sir will show whereuntil it doth amount for mine own part I am as they say but to parfect one man in one poor man Pompion the Great sir

art thou one of the Worthies

it pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the Great for mine own part I know not the degree of the Worthy but I am to stand for him

go bid them prepare

we will turn it finely off sir we will take some care


Berowne they will shame us let them not approach

we are shame-proof my lord and tis some policy
to have one show worse than the king's and his company

I say they shall not come

that sport best pleases that doth least know how
where zeal strives to content and the contents
die in the zeal of those which it presents
their form confounded makes most form in mirth
when great things labouring perish in their birth

a right description of our sport my lord


anointed I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will utter a brace of words


doth this man serve God

why ask you

he speaks not like a man of God's making

that's all one my fair sweet honey monarch for I protest the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical too-too vain too-too vain but we will put it as they say to fortuna de la guerra I wish you the peace of mind most royal couplement

here is like to be a good presence of Worthies He presents Hector of Troy the swain Pompey the Great the parish curate Alexander Armado's page Hercules the pedant Judas Maccab us
and if these four Worthies in their first show thrive
these four will change habits and present the other five

there is five in the first show

you are deceived tis not so

the pedant the braggart the hedgepriest the fool and the boy
abate throw at novum and the whole world again
cannot pick out five such take each one in his vein

the ship is under sail and here she comes amain


I Pompey am

you lie you are not he
I Pompey am

with libbard's head on knee

well said old mocker I must needs be friends with thee

I Pompey am Pompey surnam'd the Big

'The Great

it is Great sir Pompey surnam'd the Great
that oft in field with targe and shield did make my foe to sweat
and travelling along this coast I here am come by chance
and lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France
if your ladyship would say Thanks Pompey I had done

great thanks great Pompey

'Tis not so much worth but I hope I was perfect I made a little fault in Great
my hat to a halfpenny Pompey proves the best Worthy


when in the world I liv'd I was the world's commander
by east west north and south I spread my conquering might
my scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander

your nose says no you are not for it stands too right

your nose smells no in this most tender-smelling knight

the conqueror is dismay'd Proceed good Alexander

when in the world I liv'd I was the world's commander

most true tis right you were so Alisander

Pompey the Great


take away the conqueror take away Alisander


there an't shall please you a foolish mild man an honest man look you and soon dashed He is a marvellous good neighbour faith and a very good bowler but for Alisander alas you see how tis a little o'erparted But there are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort

stand aside good Pompey


great Hercules is presented by this imp
whose club kill'd Cerberus that three-headed canis
and when he was a babe a child a shrimp
thus did he strangle serpents in his manus
quoniam he seemeth in minority
ergo I come with this apology
keep some state in thy exit and vanish

Judas I am


not Iscariot sir
Judas I am ycleped Maccab us

Judas Maccab us clipt is plain Judas

a kissing traitor How art thou prov'd Judas

Judas I am

the more shame for you Judas

what mean you sir

to make Judas hang himself

begin sir you are my elder

well follow'd Judas was hanged on an elder
I will not be put out of countenance

because thou hast no face

what is this

a cittern-head

the head of a bodkin

a death's face in a ring

the face of an old Roman coin scarce seen

the pommel of C sar's falchion

the carved-bone face on a flask

Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch
ay and in a brooch of lead

ay and worn in the cap of a toothdrawer
and now forward for we have put thee in countenance

you have put me out of countenance

false we have given thee faces

but you have outfaced them all

an thou wert a lion we would do so

therefore as he is an ass let him go
and so adieu sweet Jude nay why dost thou stay

for the latter end of his name

for the ass to the Jude give it him Jud-as away
this is not generous not gentle not humble

a light for Monsieur Judas it grows dark he may stumble

alas poor Maccab us how hath he been baited


hide thy head Achilles here comes Hector in arms

though my mocks come home by me I will now be merry

Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this

but is this Hector

I think Hector was not so clean-timbered

his calf is too big for Hector


no he is best indued in the small

this cannot be Hector

he's a god or a painter for he makes faces

the armipotent Mars of lances the almighty
gave Hector a gift

a gilt nutmeg

a lemon

stuck with cloves

no cloven

peace
a man so breath'd that certain he would fight ye
from morn till night out of his pavilion
I am that flower

that mint

that columbine

sweet Lord Longaville rein thy tongue

I must rather give it the rein for it runs against Hector

ay and Hector's a greyhound

the sweet war-man is dead and rotten sweet chucks beat not the bones of the buried when he breathed he was a man But I will forward with my device

sweet royalty bestow on me the sense of hearing

speak brave Hector we are much delighted
I do adore thy sweet Grace's slipper

loves her by the foot

he may not by the yard

this Hector far surmounted Hannibal

the party is gone fellow Hector she is gone she is two months on her way

what meanest thou

faith unless you play the honest Troyan the poor wench is cast away she's quick the child brags in her belly already tis yours

dost thou infamonize me among potentates Thou shalt die

then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by him

most rare Pompey
renowned Pompey

greater than great great great great Pompey Pompey the Huge

Hector trembles

Pompey is moved More Ates more Ates stir them on stir them on

Hector will challenge him

ay if a' have no more man's blood in's belly than will sup a flea

by the north pole I do challenge thee

I will not fight with a pole like a northern man I'll slash I'll do it by the sword I bepray you let me borrow my arms again

room for the incensed Worthies

I'll do it in my shirt
most resolute Pompey

master let me take you a button-hole lower Do you not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat What mean you you will lose your reputation

gentlemen and soldiers pardon me I will not combat in my shirt

you may not deny it Pompey hath made the challenge

sweet bloods I both may and will

what reason have you for't

the naked truth of it is I have no shirt I go woolward for penance

true and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen since when I'll be sworn he wore none but a dish-clout of Jaquenetta's and that a' wears next his heart for a favour


God save you madam

but that thou interrupt'st our merriment

I am sorry madam for the news I bring
is heavy in my tongue The king your father

dead for my life

even so my tale is told

Worthies away The scene begins to cloud

for my own part I breathe free breath I have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and I will right myself like a soldier


how fares your majesty

Boyet prepare I will away to-night

madam not so I do beseech you stay
prepare I say I thank you gracious lords
for all your fair endeavours and entreat
out of a new-sad soul that you vouchsafe
in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
the liberal opposition of our spirits
if over-boldly we have borne ourselves
in the converse of breath your gentleness
was guilty of it Farewell worthy lord
a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
excuse me so coming so short of thanks
for my great suit so easily obtain'd

the extreme part of time extremely forms
all causes to the purpose of his speed
and often at his very loose decides
that which long process could not arbitrate
and though the mourning brow of progeny
forbid the smiling courtesy of love
the holy suit which fain it would convince
let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
from what it purpos'd since to wail friends lost
is not by much so wholesome-profitable
as to rejoice at friends but newly found

I understand you not my griefs are double

honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
and by these badges understand the king
for your fair sakes have we neglected time
play'd foul play with our oaths Your beauty ladies
hath much deform'd us fashioning our humours
even to the opposed end of our intents
and what in us hath seem'd ridiculous
as love is full of unbefitting strains
all wanton as a child skipping and vain
form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye
full of stray shapes of habits and of forms
varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
which parti-coated presence of loose love
put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
have misbecome our oaths and gravities
those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
suggested us to make Therefore ladies
our love being yours the error that love makes
is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false
by being once false for ever to be true
to those that make us both fair ladies you
and even that falsehood in itself a sin
thus purifies itself and turns to grace

we have receiv'd your letters full of love
your favours the embassadors of love
and in our maiden council rated them
at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
as bombast and as lining to the time
but more devout than this in our respects
have we not been and therefore met your loves

our letters madam show'd much more than jest

so did our looks

we did not quote them so

now at the latest minute of the hour
grant us your loves

a time methinks too short
to make a world-without-end bargain in
no no my lord your Grace is perjur'd much
full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
if for my love as there is no such cause
you will do aught this shall you do for me
your oath I will not trust but go with speed
to some forlorn and naked hermitage
remote from all the pleasures of the world
have brought about their annual reckoning
if this austere insociable life
change not your offer made in heat of blood
if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
but that it bear this trial and last love
then at the expiration of the year
come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
and by this virgin palm now kissing thine
I will be thine and till that instant shut
my woful self up in a mourning house
raining the tears of lamentation
for the remembrance of my father's death
if this thou do deny let our hands part
neither intitled in the other's heart

if this or more than this I would deny
to flatter up these powers of mine with rest
the sudden hand of death close up mine eye

and what to me my love and what to me

you must be purged too your sins are rack'd
you are attaint with faults and perjury
therefore if you my favour mean to get
a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest
but seek the weary beds of people sick

but what to me my love but what to me

a wife A beard fair health and honesty
with three-fold love I wish you all these three

O shall I say I thank you gentle wife

not so my lord A twelvemonth and a day
I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say
come when the king doth to my lady come

I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then

yet swear not lest you be forsworn again

what says Maria

at the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend

I'll stay with patience but the time is long

the liker you few taller are so young

studies my lady mistress look on me
behold the window of my heart mine eye
what humble suit attends thy answer there
impose some service on me for thy love

before I saw you and the world's large tongue
proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
full of comparisons and wounding flouts
which you on all estates will execute
that lie within the mercy of your wit
to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
and therewithal to win me if you please
without the which I am not to be won
you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
visit the speechless sick and still converse
with groaning wretches and your task shall be
with all the fierce endeavour of your wit
to enforce the pained impotent to smile

to move wild laughter in the throat of death
it cannot be it is impossible
mirth cannot move a soul in agony

why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit
which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
a jest's prosperity lics in the ear
of him that hears it never in the tongue
of him that makes it then if sickly ears
deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans
will hear your idle scorns continue them
and I will have you and that fault withal
but if they will not throw away that spirit
and I shall find you empty of that fault
right joyful of your reformation

a twelvemonth well befall what will befall
I'll jest a twelvemonth in a hospital

ay sweet my lord and so I take my leave

no madam we will bring you on your way

our wooing doth not end like an old play
might well have made our sport a comedy

come sir it wants a twelvemonth and a day
and then twill end

that's too long for a play


sweet majesty vouchsafe me

was not that Hector

the worthy knight of Troy

I will kiss thy royal finger and take leave I am a votary I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three years But most esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo it should have followed in the end of our show

call them forth quickly we will do so

holla approach

this side is Hiems Winter this Ver the Spring the one maintained by the owl the other by the cuckoo Ver begin

SPRING 


I 

when daisies pied and violets blue
and lady-smocks all silver-white
and cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
do paint the meadows with delight
the cuckoo then on every tree
mocks married men for thus sings he
cuckoo
cuckoo cuckoo O word of fear
unpleasing to a married ear

II 
when shepherds pipe on oaten straws
and merry larks are ploughmen's clocks
when turtles tread and rooks and daws
and maidens bleach their summer smocks
the cuckoo then on every tree
mocks married men for thus sings he
cuckoo
cuckoo cuckoo O word of fear
unpleasing to a married ear

WINTER 


III 

when icicles hang by the wall
and Dick the shepherd blows his nail
and Tom bears logs into the hall
and milk comes frozen home in pail
then nightly sings the staring owl
tu-who
tu-whit tu-who a merry note
while greasy Joan doth keel the pot

IV 

when all aloud the wind doth blow
and coughing drowns the parson's saw
and birds sit brooding in the snow
and Marian's nose looks red and raw
when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl
then nightly sings the staring owl
tu-who
tu-whit tu-who a merry note
while greasy Joan doth keel the pot


the words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo You that way we this way
MEASURE FOR MEASURE

Escalus

my lord

of government the properties to unfold
would seem in me to affect speech and discourse
since I am put to know that your own science
exceeds in that the lists of all advice
my strength can give you then no more remains
but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able
and let them work The nature of our people
our city's institutions and the terms
for common justice you're as pregnant in
as art and practice hath enriched any
that we remember There is our commission

from which we would not have you warp Call hither

what figure of us think you he will bear
for you must know we have with special soul
elected him our absence to supply
lent him our terror drest him with our love
and given his deputation all the organs
of our own power what think you of it

if any in Vienna be of worth
to undergo such ample grace and honour
it is Lord Angelo

look where he comes


always obedient to your Grace's will
I come to know your pleasure

Angelo
that to th' observer doth thy history
fully unfold Thyself and thy belongings
are not thine own so proper as to waste
thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
heaven doth with us as we with torches do
not light them for themselves for if our virtues
did not go forth of us twere all alike
as if we had them not Spirits are not finely touch'd
but to fine issues nor Nature never lends
the smallest scruple of her excellence
but like a thrifty goddess she determines
herself the glory of a creditor
both thanks and use But I do bend my speech
to one that can my part in him advertise
hold therefore Angelo

in our remove be thou at full ourself
mortality and mercy in Vienna
live in thy tongue and heart Old Escalus
take thy commission


now good my lord
let there be some more test made of my metal
before so noble and so great a figure
be stamp'd upon it

no more evasion
we have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
proceeded to you therefore take your honours
our haste from hence is of so quick condition
that it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
matters of needful value We shall write to you
as time and our concernings shall importune
how it goes with us and do look to know
what doth befall you here So fare you well
to the hopeful execution do I leave you
of your commissions
yet give leave my lord
that we may bring you something on the way

my haste may not admit it
nor need you on mine honour have to do
with any scruple your scope is as mine own
so to enforce or qualify the laws
as to your soul seems good Give me your hand
I'll privily away I love the people
but do not like to stage me to their eyes
though it do well I do not relish well
their loud applause and Aves vehement
nor do I think the man of safe discretion
that does affect it Once more fare you well

the heavens give safety to your purposes

lead forth and bring you back in happiness



I shall desire you sir to give me leave
to have free speech with you and it concerns me
to look into the bottom of my place
a power I have but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed

'Tis so with me Let us withdraw together
and we may soon our satisfaction have
touching that point

I'll wait upon your honour


if the Duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king

heaven grant us its peace but not the King of Hungary's


thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the Ten Commandments but scraped one out of the table

'Thou shalt not steal

ay that he razed

why twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal There's not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat doth relish the petition well that prays for peace

I never heard any soldier dislike it

I believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was said

no a dozen times at least

what in metre

in any proportion or in any language


ay why not Grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace

well there went but a pair of shears between us

I grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the list

and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou art a three-piled piece I warrant thee I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a French velvet Do I speak feelingly now

I think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech I will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst I live forget to drink after thee

I think I have done myself wrong have I not

yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free

behold behold where Madam Mitigation comes I have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to

to what I pray


to three thousand dolours a year

ay and more

a French crown more

thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error I am sound

nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee


how now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica

well well there's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all

who's that I pray thee

marry sir that's Claudio Signior Claudio
Claudio to prison tis not so

nay but I know tis so I saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopped off

but after all this fooling I would not have it so Art thou sure of this

I am too sure of it and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child

believe me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise-keeping

besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose

but most of all agreeing with the proclamation

away let's go learn the truth of it


thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty I am custom-shrunk


yonder man is carried to prison

well what has he done

a woman

but what's his offence

groping for trouts in a peculiar river

what is there a maid with child by him

no but there's a woman with maid by him You have not heard of the proclamation have you

what proclamation man

all houses of resort in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down


they shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them

but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down

to the ground mistress

why here's a change indeed in the commonwealth What shall become of me

come fear not you good counsellors lack no clients though you change your place you need not change your trade I'll be your tapster still Courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered

what's to do here Thomas tapster
let's withdraw

here comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to prison and there's Madam Juliet

fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world
bear me to prison where I am committed

but from Lord Angelo by special charge

thus can the demi-god Authority
make us pay down for our offence' by weight
the words of heaven on whom it will it will
on whom it will not so yet still tis just


why how now Claudio whence comes this restraint

from too much liberty my Lucio liberty
as surfeit is the father of much fast
so every scope by the immoderate use
turns to restraint Our natures do pursue
like rats that ravin down their proper bane
a thirsty evil and when we drink we die

if I could speak so wisely under an arrest I would send for certain of my creditors And yet to say the truth I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment What's thy offence Claudio


what is't murder

no

lechery

call it so

away sir you must go

one word good friend Lucio a word with you


a hundred if they'll do you any good
is lechery so looked after

thus stands it with me upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed
save that we do the denunciation lack
of outward order this we came not to
only for propagation of a dower
remaining in the coffer of her friends
from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
till time had made them for us But it chances
the stealth of our most mutual entertainment
with character too gross is writ on Juliet

with child perhaps

unhappily even so
and the new deputy now for the duke
whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
or whether that the body public be
a horse whereon the governor doth ride
who newly in the seat that it may know
he can command lets it straight feel the spur
whether the tyranny be in his place
I stagger in but this new governor
awakes me all the enrolled penalties
which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall
so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
and none of them been worn and for a name
now puts the drowsy and neglected act
freshly on me tis surely for a name

I warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off Send after the duke and appeal to him

I have done so but he's not to be found
I prithee Lucio do me this kind service
this day my sister should the cloister enter
and there receive her approbation
acquaint her with the danger of my state
implore her in my voice that she make friends
to the strict deputy bid herself assay him
I have great hope in that for in her youth
there is a prone and speechless dialect
when she will play with reason and discourse
and well she can persuade

I pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack I'll to her

I thank you good friend Lucio

within two hours

come officer away


no holy father throw away that thought
believe not that the dribbling dart of love
can pierce a complete bosom Why I desire thee
to give me secret harbour hath a purpose
more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
of burning youth


my holy sir none better knows than you
how I have ever lov'd the life remov'd
and held in idle price to haunt assemblies
where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo
a man of stricture and firm abstinence
my absolute power and place here in Vienna
and he supposes me travell'd to Poland
for so I have strew'd it in the common ear
and so it is receiv'd Now pious sir
you will demand of me why I do this

gladly my lord

we have strict statutes and most biting laws
the needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds
which for this fourteen years we have let sleep
even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave
having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch
only to stick it in their children's sight
for terror not to use in time the rod
becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees
dead to infliction to themselves are dead
and liberty plucks justice by the nose
the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
goes all decorum

it rested in your Grace
t' unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd
and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
than in Lord Angelo

I do fear too dreadful
sith twas my fault to give the people scope
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
for what I bid them do for we bid this be done
when evil deeds have their permissive pass
I have on Angelo impos'd the office
who may in the ambush of my name strike home
and yet my nature never in the sight
to do it slander And to behold his sway
I will as twere a brother of your order
visit both prince and people therefore I prithee
supply me with the habit and instruct me
how I may formally in person bear me
like a true friar Moe reasons for this action
at our more leisure shall I render you
only this one Lord Angelo is precise
stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
that his blood flows or that his appetite
is more to bread than stone hence shall we see
if power change purpose what our seemers be


and have you nuns no further privileges


yes truly I speak not as desiring more
but rather wishing a more strict restraint
upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare

ho Peace be in this place

who's that which calls

it is a man's voice Gentle Isabella
turn you the key and know his business of him
you may I may not you are yet unsworn
when you have vow'd you must not speak with men
but in the presence of the prioress
then if you speak you must not show your face
or if you show your face you must not speak
he calls again I pray you answer him




hail virgin if you be as those cheek-roses
proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me
as bring me to the sight of Isabella
a novice of this place and the fair sister
to her unhappy brother Claudio

why her unhappy brother let me ask
the rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister

gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
not to be weary with you he's in prison

woe me for what

for that which if myself might be his judge
he should receive his punishment in thanks

sir make me not your story

it is true
I would not though tis my familiar sin
with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
tongue far from heart play with all virgins so
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted
by your renouncement an immortal spirit
and to be talk'd with in sincerity
as with a saint

you do blaspheme the good in mocking me

do not believe it Fewness and truth tis thus
your brother and his lover have embrac'd
as those that feed grow full as blossoming time
that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb

some one with child by him My cousin Juliet

is she your cousin

adoptedly asschool-maids change their names
by vain though apt affection

she it is

O let him marry her

this is the point
the duke is very strangely gone from hence
bore many gentlemen myself being one
in hand and hope of action but we do learn
by those that know the very nerves of state
his givings out were of an infinite distance
from his true-meant design Upon his place
governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood
is very snow-broth one who never feels
the wanton stings and motions of the sense
but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
with profits of the mind study and fast
he to give fear to use and liberty
which have for long run by the hideous law
as mice by lions hath pick'd out an act
under whose heavy sense your brother's life
falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
and follows close the rigour of the statute
to make him an example All hope is gone
unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
to soften Angelo and that's my pith of business
twixt you and your poor brother

doth he so seek his life

he's censur'd him
a warrant for his execution

alas what poor ability's in me
to do him good

assay the power you have

my power alas I doubt

our doubts are traitors
and make us lose the good we oft might win
by fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo
and let him learn to know when maidens sue
men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
all their petitions are as freely theirs
as they themselves would owe them

I'll see what I can do


I will about it straight
no longer staying but to give the Mother
notice of my affair I humbly thank you
commend me to my brother soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success

I take my leave of you

good sir adieu

we must not make a scarecrow of the law
setting it up to fear the birds of prey
and let it keep one shape till custom make it
their perch and not their terror

ay but yet
let us be keen and rather cut a little
than fall and bruise to death Alas this gentleman
let but your honour know
whom I believe to be most strait in virtue
that in the working of your own affections
had time coher'd with place or place with wishing
or that the resolute acting of your blood
could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose
whether you had not some time in your life
err'd in this point which now you censure him
and pull'd the law upon you

'Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus
another thing to fall I not deny
the jury passing on the prisoner's life
may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
guiltier than him they try what's open made to justice
that justice seizes what know the laws
that thieves do pass on thieves Tis very pregnant
the jewel that we find we stoop and take it
because we see it but what we do not see
you may not so extenuate his offence
for I have had such faults but rather tell me
when I that censure him do so offend
let mine own judgment pattern out my death
and nothing come in partial Sir he must die

be it as your wisdom will

where is the provost

here if it like your honour

see that Claudio
be executed by nine to-morrow morning
bring him his confessor let him be prepar'd
for that's the utmost of his pilgrimage


well heaven forgive him and forgive us all
some run from brakes of ice and answer none
and some condemned for a fault alone


come bring them away if these be good people in a common-weal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses I know no law bring them away

how now sir What's your name and what's the matter

if it please your honour I am the poor duke's constable and my name is Elbow I do lean upon justice sir and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors

benefactors Well what benefactors are they are they not malefactors

if it please your honour I know not well what they are but precise villains they are that I am sure of and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have

this comes off well here's a wise officer

go to what quality are they of Elbow is your name why dost thou not speak Elbow

he cannot sir he's out at elbow
what are you sir

he sir a tapster sir parcel-bawd one that serves a bad woman whose house sir was as they say plucked down in the suburbs and now she professes a hot-house which I think is a very ill house too

how know you that

my wife sir whom I detest before heaven and your honour

how thy wife

ay sir whom I thank heaven is an honest woman

dost thou detest her therefore

I say sir I will detest myself also as well as she that this house if it be not a bawd's house it is pity of her life for it is a naughty house

how dost thou know that constable

marry sir by my wife who if she had been a woman cardinally given might have been accused in fornication adultery and all uncleanliness there
by the woman's means

ay sir by Mistress Overdone's means but as she spit in his face so she defied him

sir if it please your honour this is not so

prove it before these varlets here thou honourable man prove it

do you hear how he misplaces

sir she came in great with child and longing saving your honour's reverence for stewed prunes Sir we had but two in the house which at that very distant time stood as it were in a fruit-dish a dish of some three-pence your honours have seen such dishes they are not China dishes but very good dishes

go to go to no matter for the dish sir

no indeed sir not of a pin you are therein in the right but to the point As I say this Mistress Elbow being as I say with child and being great-bellied and longing as I said for prunes and having but two in the dish as I said Master Froth here this very man having eaten the rest as I said and as I say paying for them very honestly for as you know Master Froth I could not give you three-pence again

no indeed

very well you being then if you be remembered cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes
ay so I did indeed

why very well I telling you then if you be remembered that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of unless they kept very good diet as I told you

all this is true

why very well then

come you are a tedious fool to the purpose What was done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of Come me to what was done to her

sir your honour cannot come to that yet

no sir nor I mean it not

sir but you shall come to it by your honour's leave And I beseech you look into Master Froth here sir a man of fourscore pound a year whose father died at Hallowmas Was't not at Hallowmas Master Froth

all-hallownd eve

why very well I hope here be truths He sir sitting as I say in a lower chair sir twas in the Bunch of Grapes where indeed you have a delight to sit have you not
I have so because it is an open room and good for winter

why very well then I hope here be truths

this will last out a night in Russia
when nights are longest there I'll take my leave
and leave you to the hearing of the cause
hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all

I think no less Good morrow to your lordship

now sir come on what was done to Elbow's wife once more

once sir there was nothing done to her once

I beseech you sir ask him what this man did to my wife

I beseech your honour ask me


I beseech you sir look in this gentleman's face Good Master Froth look upon his honour tis for a good purpose Doth your honour mark his face

ay sir very well

nay I beseech you mark it well

well I do so

doth your honour see any harm in his face

why no

I'll be supposed upon a book his face is the worst thing about him Good then if his face be the worst thing about him how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm I would know that of your honour

he's in the right Constable what say you to it

first an' it like you the house is a respected house next this is a respected fellow and his mistress is a respected woman


varlet thou liest thou liest wicked varlet The time is yet to come that she was ever respected with man woman or child

sir she was respected with him before he married with her

which is the wiser here Justice or Iniquity Is this true

O thou caitiff O thou varlet O thou wicked Hannibal I respected with her before I was married to her If ever I was respected with her or she with me let not your worship think me the poor duke's officer Prove this thou wicked Hannibal or I'll have mine action of battery on thee

if he took you a box o' th' ear you might have your action of slander too

marry I thank your good worship for it What is't your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff

truly officer because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldest discover if thou couldst let him continue in his courses till thou knowest what they are

marry I thank your worship for it Thou seest thou wicked varlet now what's come upon thee thou art to continue now thou varlet thou art to continue

where were you born friend


are you of fourscore pounds a year

yes an't please you sir

so

what trade are you of sir

a tapster a poor widow's tapster

your mistress' name

mistress Overdone

hath she had any more than one husband

nine sir Overdone by the last


I thank your worship For mine own part I never come into any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in

well no more of it Master Froth farewell

come you hither to me Master tapster What's your name Master tapster

Pompey

what else

bum sir

troth and your bum is the greatest thing about you so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the Great Pompey you are partly a bawd Pompey howsoever you colour it in being a tapster are you not come tell me true it shall be the better for you

truly sir I am a poor fellow that would live

how would you live Pompey by being a bawd What do you think of the trade Pompey is it a lawful trade


but the law will not allow it Pompey nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna

does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city

no Pompey

truly sir in my humble opinion they will to't then If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves you need not to fear the bawds

there are pretty orders beginning I can tell you it is but heading and hanging

if you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together you'll be glad to give out a commission for more heads If this law hold in Vienna ten year I'll rent the fairest house in it after threepence a bay If you live to see this come to pass say Pompey told you so

thank you good Pompey and in requital of your prophecy hark you I advise you let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever no not for dwelling where you do if I do Pompey I shall beat you to your tent and prove a shrewd C sar to you In plain dealing Pompey I shall have you whipt So for this time Pompey fare you well

I thank your worship for your good counsel

but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine
whip me No no let carman whip his jade


come hither to me Master Elbow come hither Master constable How long have you been in this place of constable

seven year and a half sir

I thought by your readiness in the office you had continued in it some time You say seven years together

and a half sir

alas it hath been great pains to you They do you wrong to put you so oft upon t Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it

faith sir few of any wit in such matters As they are chosen they are glad to choose me for them I do it for some piece of money and go through with all

look you bring me in the names of some six or seven the most sufficient of your parish

to your worship's house sir

to my house Fare you well
what's o'clock think you

eleven sir

I pray you home to dinner with me

I humbly thank you

it grieves me for the death of Claudio
but there is no remedy

lord Angelo is severe

it is but needful
mercy is not itself that oft looks so
pardon is still the nurse of second woe
but yet poor Claudio There's no remedy
come sir

he's hearing of a cause he will come straight
I'll tell him of you

pray you do

I'll know
his pleasure may be he will relent Alas
he hath but as offended in a dream
all sects all ages smack of this vice and he
to die for it


now what's the matter provost

is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow

did I not tell thee yea hadst thou not order
why dost thou ask again

under your good correction I have seen
when after execution Judgment hath
repented o'er his doom

go to let that be mine
do you your office or give up your place
and you shall well be spar'd

I crave your honour's pardon
what shall be done sir with the groaning Juliet
she's very near her hour

dispose of her
to some more fitter place and that with speed


here is the sister of the man condemn'd
desires access to you


ay my good lord a very virtuous maid
and to be shortly of a sisterhood
if not already

well let her be admitted

see you the fornicatress be remov'd
let her have needful but not lavish means
there shall be order for't


God save your honour


stay a little while

you're welcome what's your will

please but your honour hear me

well what's your suit

there is a vice that most I do abhor
and most desire should meet the blow of justice
for which I would not plead but that I must
for which I must not plead but that I am
at war twixt will and will not

well the matter

I have a brother is condemn'd to die
I do beseech you let it be his fault
and not my brother

heaven give thee moving graces

condemn the fault and not the actor of it
mine were the very cipher of a function
to fine the faults whose fine stands in record
and let go by the actor

O just but severe law
I had a brother then Heaven keep your honour


give't not o'er so to him again entreat him
kneel down before him hang upon his gown
you are too cold if you should need a pin
you could not with more tame a tongue desire it
to him I say

must he needs die

maiden no remedy

yes I do think that you might pardon him

I will not do't

but can you if you would

look what I will not that I cannot do

but might you do't and do the world no wrong
if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
as mine is to him

he's sentenc'd tis too late

you are too cold

too late why no I that do speak a word
may call it back again Well believe this
no ceremony that to great ones longs
not the king's crown nor the deputed sword
become them with one half so good a grace
as mercy does
if he had been as you and you as he
you would have slipt like him but he like you
would not have been so stern

pray you be gone

I would to heaven I had your potency
and you were Isabel should it then be thus
no I would tell what twere to be a judge
and what a prisoner

ay touch him there's the vein

your brother is a forfeit of the law
and you but waste your words

alas alas
and He that might the vantage best have took
found out the remedy How would you be
if He which is the top of judgment should
but judge you as you are O think on that
and mercy then will breathe within your lips
like man new made

be you content fair maid
it is the law not I condemn your brother
were he my kinsman brother or my son
it should be thus with him he must die to-morrow

to-morrow O that's sudden Spare him spare him
he's not prepar'd for death Even for our kitchens
we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
with less respect than we do minister
to our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you
who is it that hath died for this offence
there's many have committed it
ay well said

the law hath not been dead though it hath slept
those many had not dar'd to do that evil
if that the first that did th' edict infringe
had answer'd for his deed now tis awake
takes note of what is done and like a prophet
looks in a glass that shows what future evils
either new or by remissness new-conceiv'd
and so in progress to be hatch'd and born
are now to have no successive degrees
but ere they live to end

yet show some pity

I show it most of all when I show justice
for then I pity those I do not know
which a dismiss'd offence would after gall
and do him right that answering one foul wrong
your brother dies to-morrow be content

so you must be the first that gives this sentence
and he that suffers O it is excellent
to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous
to use it like a giant

that's well said

could great men thunder
as Jove himself does Jove would ne'er be quiet
for every pelting petty officer
would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder
merciful heaven
thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
than the soft myrtle but man proud man
drest in a little brief authority
most ignorant of what he's most assur'd
plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
as make the angels weep who with our spleens
would all themselves laugh mortal

O to him to him wench He will relent
he's coming I perceive't

pray heaven she win him

we cannot weigh our brother with ourself
great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
but in the less foul profanation

thou'rt in the right girl more o' that

that in the captain's but a choleric word
which in the soldier is flat blasphemy

art advis'd o' that more on t
why do you put these sayings upon me

because authority though it err like others
hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
that skins the vice o' the top Go to your bosom
knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
that's like my brother's fault if it confess
a natural guiltiness such as is his
let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
against my brother's life

she speaks and tis
such sense that my sense breeds with it Fare you well

gentle my lord turn back

I will bethink me Come again to-morrow

hark how I'll bribe you Good my lord turn back
how bribe me

ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you

you had marr'd all else

not with fond sicles of the tested gold
or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
as fancy values them but with true prayers
that shall be up at heaven and enter there
ere sun-rise prayers from preserved souls
from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
to nothing temporal

well come to me to-morrow

go to tis well away

heaven keep your honour safe
amen
for I am that way going to temptation
where prayers cross

at what hour to-morrow
shall I attend your lordship

at any time fore noon

save your honour


from thee even from thy virtue
what's this what's this Is this her fault or mine
the tempter or the tempted who sins most
ha
not she nor doth she tempt but it is I
that lying by the violet in the sun
do as the carrion does not as the flower
that modesty may more betray our sense
than woman's lightness Having waste ground enough
shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
and pitch our evils there O fie fie fie
what dost thou or what art thou Angelo
dost thou desire her foully for those things
that make her good O let her brother live
thieves for their robbery have authority
when judges steal themselves What do I love her
that I desire to hear her speak again
and feast upon her eyes What is't I dream on
O cunning enemy that to catch a saint
with saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous
is that temptation that doth goad us on
to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet
with all her double vigour art and nature
once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
subdues me quite Ever till now
when men were fond I smil'd and wonder'd how

hail to you provost so I think you are

I am the provost What's your will good friar

bound by my charity and my bless'd order
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
here in the prison do me the common right
to let me see them and to make me know
the nature of their crimes that I may minister
to them accordingly

I would do more than that if more were needful
look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
who falling in the flaws of her own youth
hath blister'd her report She is with child
and he that got it sentenc'd a young man
more fit to do another such offence
than die for this

when must he die

as I do think to-morrow


I have provided for you stay a while
and you shall be conducted

repent you fair one of the sin you carry

I do and bear the shame most patiently

I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
and try your penitence if it be sound
or hollowly put on

I'll gladly learn


yes as I love the woman that wrong'd him

so then it seems your most offenceful act
was mutually committed

mutually

then was your sin of heavier kind than his

I do confess it and repent it father

'Tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
as that the sin hath brought you to this shame
which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven
showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
but as we stand in fear

I do repent me as it is an evil

there rest
your partner as I hear must die to-morrow
and I am going with instruction to him
God's grace go with you Benedicite


must die to-morrow O injurious love
that respites me a life whose very comfort
is still a dying horror

'Tis pity of him


when I would pray and think I think and pray
to several subjects heaven hath my empty words
whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
anchors on Isabel heaven in my mouth
as if I did but only chew his name
of my conception The state whereon I studied
is like a good thing being often read
grown fear'd and tedious yea my gravity
wherein let no man hear me I take pride
could I with boot change for an idle plume
which the air beats for vain O place O form
how often dost thou with thy case thy habit
wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
to thy false seeming Blood thou art blood
let's write good angel on the devil's horn
'Tis not the devil's crest

how now who's there

one Isabel a sister
desires access to you

teach her the way

why does my blood thus muster to my heart
making both it unable for itself
and dispossessing all my other parts
of necessary fitness
so play the foolish throngs with one that swounds
come all to help him and so stop the air
by which he should revive and even so
the general subject to a well-wish'd king
quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
crowd to his presence where their untaught love
must needs appear offence

how now fair maid

I am come to know your pleasure

that you might know it would much better please me
than to demand what tis Your brother cannot live


yet may he live awhile and it may be
as long as you or I yet he must die

under your sentence

yea

when I beseech you that in his reprieve
longer or shorter he may be so fitted
that his soul sicken not

ha fie these filthy vices It were as good
to pardon him that hath from nature stolen
a man already made as to remit
their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy
falsely to take away a life true made
as to put metal in restrained means

'Tis set down so in heaven but not in earth

say you so then I shall pose you quickly
which had you rather that the most just law
now took your brother's life or to redeem him
give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
as she that he hath stain'd

sir believe this
I had rather give my body than my soul

I talk not of your soul Our compell'd sins
stand more for number than for accompt

how say you

nay I'll not warrant that for I can speak
against the thing I say Answer to this
pronounce a sentence on your brother's life
might there not be a charity in sin
to save this brother's life

please you to do't
I'll take it as a peril to my soul
it is no sin at all but charity

pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul
were equal poise of sin and charity

that I do beg his life if it be sin
heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
if that be sin I'll make it my morn prayer
to have it added to the faults of mine
and nothing of your answer

nay but hear me
your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant

let me be ignorant and in nothing good
but graciously to know I am no better

thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
when it doth tax itself as these black masks
proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
than beauty could display'd But mark me
to be received plain I'll speak more gross
your brother is to die

so

and his offence is so as it appears
accountant to the law upon that pain

true

admit no other way to save his life
but in the loss of question that you his sister
finding yourself desir'd of such a person
whose credit with the judge or own great place
could fetch your brother from the manacles
of the all-building law and that there were
no earthly mean to save him but that either
you must lay down the treasures of your body
to this suppos'd or else to let him suffer
what would you do

as much for my poor brother as myself
that is were I under the terms of death
th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies
and strip myself to death as to a bed
that longing have been sick for ere I'd yield
my body up to shame

then must your brother die

better it were a brother died at once
than that a sister by redeeming him
should die for ever

were not you then as cruel as the sentence
that you have slander'd so

ignomy in ransom and free pardon
are of two houses lawful mercy
is nothing kin to foul redemption

you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant
and rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
a merriment than a vice

O pardon me my lord it oft falls out
to have what we would have we speak not what we mean
I something do excuse the thing I hate
for his advantage that I dearly love
we are all frail

else let my brother die
if not a feodary but only he
owe and succeed thy weakness

nay women are frail too

ay as the glasses where they view themselves
which are as easy broke as they make forms
women Help heaven men their creation mar
in profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail
for we are soft as our complexions are
and credulous to false prints

I think it well
and from this testimony of your own sex
since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
than faults may shake our frames let me be bold
that is a woman if you be more you're none
if you be one as you are well express'd
by all external warrants show it now
by putting on the destin'd livery

I have no tongue but one gentle my lord
let me entreat you speak the former language

plainly conceive I love you

my brother did love Juliet and you tell me
that he shall die for't

he shall not Isabel if you give me love

I know your virtue hath a licence in't
which seems a little fouler than it is
to pluck on others

my words express my purpose

ha little honour to be much believ'd
and most pernicious purpose Seeming seeming
I will proclaim thee Angelo look for't
sign me a present pardon for my brother
or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
what man thou art

who will believe thee Isabel
my unsoil'd name the austereness of my life
my vouch against you and my place i' the state
will so your accusation overweigh
that you shall stifle in your own report
and smell of calumny I have begun
and now I give my sensual race the rein
fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
or else he must not only die the death
but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
to lingering sufferance Answer me to-morrow
or by the affection that now guides me most
I'll prove a tyrant to him As for you
say what you can my false o'erweighs your true


to whom should I complain Did I tell this
who would believe me O perilous mouths
that bear in them one and the self-same tongue
either of condemnation or approof
bidding the law make curt'sy to their will
hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite
to follow as it draws I'll to my brother
though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
that had he twenty heads to tender down
on twenty bloody blocks he'd yield them up
to such abhorr'd pollution
then Isabel live chaste and brother die
more than our brother is our chastity
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request
and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest

so then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo

the miserable have no other medicine
but only hope
I have hope to live and am prepar'd to die

be absolute for death either death or life
shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life
if I do lose thee I do lose a thing
that none but fools would keep a breath thou art
servile to all the skyey influences
that dost this habitation where thou keep'st
hourly afflict Merely thou art death's fool
and yet run'st toward him still Thou art not noble
for all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
are nurs'd by baseness Thou art by no means valiant
for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
of a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep
and that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st
thy death which is no more Thou art not thyself
for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
that issue out of dust Happy thou art not
for what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get
and what thou hast forget'st Thou art not certain
for thy complexion shifts to strange effects
after the moon If thou art rich thou'rt poor
for like an ass whose back with ingots bows
thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey
and death unloads thee Friend hast thou none
for thine own bowels which do call thee sire
the mere effusion of thy proper loins
do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
but as it were an after-dinner's sleep
dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
to make thy riches pleasant What's yet in this
that bears the name of life Yet in this life
lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear
that makes these odds all even

I humbly thank you
to sue to live I find I seek to die
and seeking death find life let it come on

what ho Peace here grace and good company

who's there come in the wish deserves a welcome

dear sir ere long I'll visit you again
most holy sir I thank you


my business is a word or two with Claudio

and very welcome Look signior here's your sister

provost a word with you

as many as you please

bring me to hear them speak where I may be conceal'd


now sister what's the comfort

why as all comforts are most good most good indeed
lord Angelo having affairs to heaven
intends you for his swift ambassador
therefore your best appointment make with speed
to-morrow you set on

is there no remedy

none but such remedy as to save a head
to cleave a heart in twain

but is there any

yes brother you may live
there is a devilish mercy in the judge
if you'll implore it that will free your life
but fetter you till death

perpetual durance

ay just perpetual durance a restraint
though all the world's vastidity you had

but in what nature

in such a one as you consenting to't
would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
and leave you naked

let me know the point

O I do fear thee Claudio and I quake
lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
and six or seven winters more respect
than a perpetual honour Dar'st thou die
the sense of death is most in apprehension
and the poor beetle that we tread upon
in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
as when a giant dies

why give you me this shame
from flowery tenderness If I must die
I will encounter darkness as a bride
and hug it in mine arms

there spake my brother there my father's grave
did utter forth a voice Yes thou must die
thou art too noble to conserve a life
in base appliances This outward-sainted deputy
whose settled visage and deliberate word
nips youth i' the head and follies doth enmew
as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
his filth within being cast he would appear
a pond as deep as hell

the prenzie Angelo

O tis the cunning livery of hell
the damned'st body to invest and cover
in prenzie guards Dost thou think Claudio
thou mightst be freed

O heavens it cannot be

yes he would give't thee from this rank offence
so to offend him still This night's the time
that I should do what I abhor to name
or else thou diest to-morrow

thou shalt not do't

O were it but my life
I'd throw it down for your deliverance
as frankly as a pin

thanks dear Isabel

be ready Claudio for your death to-morrow

that thus can make him bite the law by the nose
when he would force it Sure it is no sin
or of the deadly seven it is the least

which is the least

if it were damnable he being so wise
why would he for the momentary trick
be perdurably fin'd O Isabel

what says my brother

death is a fearful thing

and shamed life a hateful

ay but to die and go we know not where
to lie in cold obstruction and to rot
this sensible warm motion to become
to bathe in fiery floods or to reside
in thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice
to be imprison'd in the viewless winds
and blown with restless violence round about
the pendant world or to be worse than worst
of those that lawless and incertain thoughts
imagine howling tis too horrible
the weariest and most loathed worldly life
that age ache penury and imprisonment
can lay on nature is a paradise
to what we fear of death

alas alas

sweet sister let me live
what sin you do to save a brother's life
nature dispenses with the deed so far
that it becomes a virtue

O faithless coward O dishonest wretch
wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
is't not a kind of incest to take life
from thine own sister's shame What should I think
heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair
for such a warped slip of wilderness
ne'er issu'd from his blood Take my defiance
die perish Might but my bending down
reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death
no word to save thee

nay hear me Isabel

O fie fie fie
thy sin's not accidental but a trade
mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
'Tis best that thou diest quickly

O hear me Isabella


vouchsafe a word young sister but one word

what is your will

might you dispense with your leisure I would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefit

I have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but I will attend you a while

son I have overheard what hath past between you and your sister Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures She having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive I am confessor to Angelo and I know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible to-morrow you must die go to your knees and make ready

let me ask my sister pardon I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it

hold you there farewell


provost a word with you
what's your will father

that now you are come you will be gone Leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company

in good time


the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair The assault that Angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling I should wonder at Angelo How would you do to content this substitute and to save your brother

I am now going to resolve him I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born But O how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo If ever he return and I can speak to him I will open my lips in vain or discover his government

that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business

let me hear you speak further I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit

virtue is bold and goodness never fearful Have you not heard speak of Mariana the sister of Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea

I have heard of the lady and good words went with her name


can this be so Did Angelo so leave her

left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not

what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world What corruption in this life that it will let this man live But how out of this can she avail

it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it

show me how good father

this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly Go you to Angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience This being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor Mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt If you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof What think you of it

the image of it gives me content already and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection

it lies much in your holding up Haste you speedily to Angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction I will presently to St Luke's there at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with Angelo that it may be quickly

I thank you for this comfort Fare you well good father

nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard

O heavens what stuff is here

'Twas never merry world since of two usuries the merriest was put down and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm and furred with fox and lamb skins too to signify that craft being richer than innocency stands for the facing

come your way sir Bless you good father friar

and you good brother father What offence hath this man made you sir

marry sir he hath offended the law and sir we take him to be a thief too sir for we have found upon him sir a strange picklock which we have sent to the deputy

fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd
the evil that thou causest to be done
that is thy means to live Do thou but think
what tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
from such a filthy vice say to thyself
from their abominable and beastly touches
I drink I eat array myself and live
so stinkingly depending Go mend go mend

indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet sir I would prove

nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin
thou wilt prove his Take him to prison officer
correction and instruction must both work
ere this rude beast will profit

he must before the deputy sir he has given him warning The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster if he be a whoremonger and comes before him he were as good go a mile on his errand

that we were all as some would seem to be
from our faults as faults from seeming free

his neck will come to your waist a cord sir

I spy comfort I cry bail Here's a gentleman and a friend of mine



still thus and thus still worse

how doth my dear morsel thy mistress Procures she still ha

troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she is herself in the tub

why tis good it is the right of it it must be so ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd an unshunned consequence it must be so Art going to prison Pompey

yes faith sir

why tis not amiss Pompey Farewell Go say I sent thee thither For debt Pompey or how

for being a bawd for being a bawd

well then imprison him If imprisonment be the due of a bawd why tis his right bawd is he doubtless and of antiquity too bawd-born Farewell good Pompey Commend me to the prison Pompey You will turn good husband now Pompey you will keep the house

I hope sir your good worship will be my bail


and you

does Bridget paint still Pompey ha

come your ways sir come

you will not bail me then sir

then Pompey nor now What news abroad friar What news

come your ways sir come

go to kennel Pompey go

what news friar of the duke

I know none Can you tell me of any


I know not where but wheresoever I wish him well

it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to't

he does well in't

a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar

it is too general a vice and severity must cure it

yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think you

how should he be made then

some report a sea-maid spawn'd him some that he was begot between two stock-fishes But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that I know to be true and he is a motion generative that's infallible

you are pleasant sir and speak apace


I never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way

O sir you are deceived

'Tis not possible

who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish the duke had crotchets in him He would be drunk too that let me inform you

you do him wrong surely

sir I was an inward of his A shy fellow was the duke and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing

what I prithee might be the cause

no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this I can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise

wise why no question but he was


either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier Therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice

sir I know him and I love him

love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love

come sir I know what I know

I can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak But if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it I am bound to call upon you and I pray you your name

sir my name is Lucio well known to the duke

he shall know you better sir if I may live to report you

I fear you not

O you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite But indeed I can do you little harm you'll forswear this again


why should he die sir

why for filling a bottle with a tundish I would the duke we talk of were returned again this ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because they are lecherous The duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing Farewell good friar I prithee pray for me The duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on Fridays He's not past it yet and I say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that I said so Farewell


no might nor greatness in mortality
can censure scape back-wounding calumny
the whitest virtue strikes What king so strong
can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue
but who comes here


go away with her to prison

good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lord

double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant


my lord this is one Lucio's information against me Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the duke's time he promised her marriage his child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob I have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me

that fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be called before us Away with her to prison Go to no more words

provost my brother Angelo will not be altered Claudio must die to-morrow Let him be furnished with divines and have all charitable preparation if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with him

so please you this friar hath been with him and advised him for the entertainment of death

good even good father

bliss and goodness on you

of whence are you

not of this country though my chance is now
to use it for my time I am a brother
of gracious order late come from the See
in special business from his Holiness
what news abroad i' the world

none but there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accursed Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world This news is old enough yet it is every day's news I pray you sir of what disposition was the duke

one that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself

what pleasure was he given to

rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at anything which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance But leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared I am made to understand that you have lent him visitation

he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which I by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die

you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice

if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself

I am going to visit the prisoner Fare you well

peace be with you
he who the sword of heaven will bear
should be as holy as severe
pattern in himself to know
Grace to stand and virtue go
more nor less to others paying
than by self offences weighing
shame to him whose cruel striking
kills for faults of his own liking
twice treble shame on Angelo
to weed my vice and let his grow
O what may man within him hide
though angel on the outward side
how many likeness made in crimes
making practice on the times
to draw with idle spiders' strings
most pond'rous and substantial things
craft against vice I must apply
with Angelo to-night shall lie
his old betrothed but despis'd
pay with falsehood false exacting
and perform an old contracting

take O take those lips away
that so sweetly were forsworn
and those eyes the break of day
lights that do mislead the morn
but my kisses bring again
bring again
seals of love but seal'd in vain
seal'd in vain


break off thy song and haste thee quick away
here comes a man of comfort whose advice
hath often still'd my brawling discontent

I cry you mercy sir and well could wish
you had not found me here so musical

my mirth it much displeas'd but pleas'd my woe

'Tis good though music oft hath such a charm
to make bad good and good provoke to harm
I pray you tell me hath anybody inquired for me here to-day much upon this time have I promised here to meet

you have not been inquired after I have sat here all day

I do constantly believe you The time is come even now I shall crave your forbearance a little may be I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself

I am always bound to you

very well met and well come
what is the news from this good deputy

he hath a garden circummur'd with brick
whose western side is with a vineyard back'd
and to that vineyard is a planched gate
this other doth command a little door
which from the vineyard to the garden leads
there have I made my promise
upon the heavy middle of the night
to call upon him

but shall you on your knowledge find this way

I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't
with whispering and most guilty diligence
in action all of precept he did show me
the way twice o'er

are there no other tokens
between you greed concerning her observance

no none but only a repair i' the dark
and that I have possess'd him my most stay
can be but brief for I have made him know
that stays upon me whose persuasion is
I come about my brother

'Tis well borne up
I have not yet made known to Mariana
a word of this What ho within come forth


I pray you be acquainted with this maid

she comes to do you good

I do desire the like

do you persuade yourself that I respect you

good friar I know you do and oft have found it

take then this your companion by the hand
I shall attend your leisure but make haste
the vaporous night approaches

will't please you walk aside


O place and greatness millions of false eyes
are stuck upon thee volumes of report
run with these false and most contrarious quests
upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit
make thee the father of their idle dream
and rack thee in their fancies

welcome How agreed

she'll take the enterprise upon her father
if you advise it

it is not my consent

little have you to say
when you depart from him but soft and low
'Remember now my brother

fear me not

nor gentle daughter fear you not at all
he is your husband on a pre-contract
to bring you thus together tis no sin
sith that the justice of your title to him
doth flourish the deceit Come let us go
our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow


come hither sirrah Can you cut off a man's head

if the man be a bachelor sir I can but if he be a married man he is his wife's head and I can never cut off a woman's head


sir I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman I would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow partner

what ho Abhorson Where's Abhorson there


do you call sir

sirrah here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your execution If you think it meet compound with him by the year and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present and dismiss him He cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd

a bawd sir Fie upon him he will discredit our mystery

go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale


pray sir by your good favour for surely sir a good favour you have but that you have a hanging look do you call sir your occupation a mystery

ay sir a mystery


sir it is a mystery

proof

every true man's apparel fits your thief

if it be too little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough so every true man's apparel fits your thief


are you agreed

sir I will serve him for I do find that your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth often ask forgiveness

you sirrah provide your block and your axe to-morrow four o'clock

come on bawd I will instruct thee in my trade follow

I do desire to learn sir and I hope if you have occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly sir for your kindness I owe you a good turn
call hither Barnardine and Claudio

the one has my pity not a jot the other
being a murderer though he were my brother


look here's the warrant Claudio for thy death
'Tis now dead midnight and by eight to-morrow

thou must be made immortal Where's Barnardine

as fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
when it lies starkly in the traveller's bones
he will not wake

who can do good on him
well go prepare yourself

but hark what noise

by and by
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
for the most gentle Claudio

welcome father

the best and wholesom'st spirits of the night
envelop you good provost Who call'd here of late

none since the curfew rung

not Isabel

no

they will then ere't be long

what comfort is for Claudio
there's some in hope

it is a bitter deputy

not so not so his life is parallel'd
even with the stroke and line of his great justice
he doth with holy abstinence subdue
that in himself which he spurs on his power
to qualify in others were he meal'd with that
which he corrects then were he tyrannous
but this being so he's just

now are they come

this is a gentle provost seldom when
the steeled gaoler is the friend of men

how now What noise That spirit's possess'd with haste
that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes

there he must stay until the officer
arise to let him in he is call'd up

have you no countermand for Claudio yet
but he must die to-morrow

none sir none

as near the dawning provost as it is
you shall hear more ere morning

happily
you something know yet I believe there comes
no countermand no such example have we
besides upon the very siege of justice
lord Angelo hath to the public ear
profess'd the contrary


and here comes Claudio's pardon

my lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other circumstance Good morrow for as I take it it is almost day

I shall obey him


this is his pardon purchased by such sin
for which the pardoner himself is in
hence hath offence his quick celerity
when it is borne in high authority
when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended
that for the fault's love is the offender friended
now sir what news

I told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks strangely for he hath not used it before

pray you let's hear
whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon Barnardine For my better satisfaction let me have Claudio's head sent me by five Let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver Thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril
what say you to this sir

what is that Barnardine who is to be executed this afternoon

a Bohemian born but here nursed up and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old

how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his manner to do so

his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo came not to an undoubtful proof

it is now apparent

most manifest and not denied by himself

hath he borne himself penitently in prison How seems he to be touched

a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal


he will hear none He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk We have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all

more of him anon There is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if I read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than Angalo who hath sentenced him To make you understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy

pray sir in what

in the delaying death

alack how may I do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of Angelo I may make my case as Claudio's to cross this in the smallest

by the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions may be your guide Let this Barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to Angelo

Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour

O death's a great disguiser and you may add to it Shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against it with my life

pardon me good father it is against my oath


to him and to his substitutes

you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing

but what likelihood is in that

not a resemblance but a certainty Yet since I see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character I doubt not and the signet is not strange to you

I know them both

the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon over-read if at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here This is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance of the duke's death perchance his entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ Look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known Call your executioner and off with Barnardine's head I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place Yet you are amaz'd but this shall absolutely resolve you Come away it is almost clear dawn


I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own house for here be many of her old customers First here's young Master Rash he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger nine-score and seventeen pounds of which he made five marks ready money marry then ginger was not much in request for the old women were all dead Then is there here one Master Caper at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer for some four suits of peach-colour'd satin which now peaches him a beggar Then have we young Dizy and young Master Deep-vow and Master Copperspur and Master Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man and young Drop-heir that kill'd lusty Pudding and Master Forthlight the tilter and brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveller and wild Half-can that stabbed Pots and I think forty more all great doers in our trade and are now for the Lord's sake


sirrah bring Barnardine hither


what ho Barnardine

a pox o' your throats
who makes that noise there What are you

your friends sir the hangman You must be so good sir to rise and be put to death

away you rogue away
I am sleepy

tell him he must awake and that quickly too

pray Master Barnardine awake till you are executed and sleep afterwards

go in to him and fetch him out

he is coming sir he is coming I hear his straw rustle


very ready sir


how now Abhorson what's the news with you

truly sir I would desire you to clap into your prayers for look you the warrant's come

you rogue I have been drinking all night I am not fitted for't

O the better sir for he that drinks all night and is hang'd betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day

look you sir here comes your ghostly father do we jest now think you


sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart I am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you

friar not I I have been drinking hard all night and I will have more time to prepare me or they shall beat out my brains with billets I will not consent to die this day that's certain


I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion

but hear you

not a word if you have anything to say to me come to my ward for thence will not I to day

unfit to live or die O gravel heart
after him fellows bring him to the block


now sir how do you find the prisoner

a creature unprepar'd unmeet for death
and to transport him in the mind he is
were damnable

here in the prison father
there died this morning of a cruel fever
a man of Claudio's years his beard and head
just of his colour What if we do omit
this reprobate till he were well inclin'd
and satisfy the deputy with the visage
of Ragozine more like to Claudio

O tis an accident that heaven provides
dispatch it presently the hour draws on
prefix'd by Angelo See this be done
and sent according to command whiles I
persuade this rude wretch willingly to die

this shall be done good father presently
but Barnardine must die this afternoon
and how shall we continue Claudio
to save me from the danger that might come
if he were known alive

let this be done
ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
to the under generation you shall find
your safety manifested

I am your free dependant

quick dispatch
and send the head to Angelo

now will I write letters to Angelo
the provost he shall bear them whose contents
shall witness to him I am near at home
and that by great injunctions I am bound
to enter publicly him I'll desire
to meet me at the consecrated fount
a league below the city and from thence
by cold gradation and well-balanc'd form
we shall proceed with Angelo

here is the head I'll carry it myself

convenient is it Make a swift return
for I would commune with you of such things
that want no ear but yours

I'll make all speed


peace ho be here

the tongue of Isabel She's come to know
if yet her brother's pardon be come hither
but I will keep her ignorant of her good
to make her heavenly comforts of despair
when it is least expected


ho by your leave
good morning to you fair and gracious daughter

the better given me by so holy a man
hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon

he hath releas'd him Isabel from the world
his head is off and sent to Angelo

nay but it is not so

it is no other show your wisdom daughter
in your close patience

O I will to him and pluck out his eyes

you shall not be admitted to his sight

unhappy Claudio Wretched Isabel
injurious world Most damned Angelo
this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot
forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven
mark what I say which you shall find
by every syllable a faithful verity
the duke comes home to-morrow nay dry your eyes
one of our covent and his confessor
gives me this instance already he hath carried
notice to Escalus and Angelo
who do prepare to meet him at the gates
there to give up their power If you can pace your wisdom
in that good path that I would wish it go
and you shall have your bosom on this wretch
Grace of the Duke revenges to your heart
and general honour

I am directed by you

this letter then to Friar Peter give
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return
at Mariana's house to-night Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal and he shall bring you
before the duke and to the head of Angelo
accuse him home and home For my poor self
I am combined by a sacred vow
and shall be absent Wend you with this letter
command these fretting waters from your eyes
with a light heart trust not my holy order
if I pervert your course Who's here


good even Friar where is the provost

not within sir

O pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red thou must be patient I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to't But they say the duke will be here to-morrow By my troth Isabel I loved thy brother if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived


sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in them
friar thou knowest not the duke so well as I do he's a better woodman than thou takest him for

well you'll answer this one day
fare ye well

nay tarry I'll go along with thee I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke

you have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enough

I was once before him for getting a wench with child

did you such a thing

yes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar

sir your company is fairer than honest
rest you well

by my troth I'll go with thee to the lane's end If bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of it Nay friar I am a kind of burr I shall stick

every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other

in most uneven and distracted manner
his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted And why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there

I guess not

and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street

he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against us

well I beseech you let it be proclaim'd
betimes i' the morn I'll call you at your house
give notice to such men of sort and suit
as are to meet him

I shall sir fare you well


this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
and dull to all proceedings A deflower'd maid
and by an eminent body that enforc'd
the law against it But that her tender shame
will not proclaim against her maiden loss
how might she tongue me Yet reason dares her no
for my authority bears so credent bulk
that no particular scandal once can touch
but it confounds the breather He should have liv'd
save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
might in the times to come have ta'en revenge
by so receiving a dishonour'd life
with ransom of such shame Would yet he had liv'd
alack when once our grace we have forgot
nothing goes right we would and we would not


these letters at fit time deliver me
the provost knows our purpose and our plot
the matter being afoot keep your instruction
and hold you ever to our special drift
though sometimes you do blench from this to that
as cause doth minister Go call at Flavius' house
and tell him where I stay give the like notice
to Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus
and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate
but send me Flavius first

it shall be speeded well

I thank thee Varrius thou hast made good haste
come we will walk There's other of our friends
will greet us here anon my gentle Varrius


to speak so indirectly I am loath
I would say the truth but to accuse him so
he says to veil full purpose

be rul'd by him

besides he tells me that if peradventure
he speak against me on the adverse side
I should not think it strange for tis a physic
that's bitter to sweet end

I would Friar Peter

O peace the friar is come


come I have found you out a stand most fit
where you may have such vantage on the duke
he shall not pass you Twice have the trumpets sounded
the generous and gravest citizens
have hent the gates and very near upon

my very worthy cousin fairly met
our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you

happy return be to your royal Grace

happy return be to your royal Grace

many and hearty thankings to you both
we have made inquiry of you and we hear
such goodness of your justice that our soul
cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
forerunning more requital

you make my bonds still greater

O your desert speaks loud and I should wrong it
to lock it in the wards of covert bosom
when it deserves with characters of brass
and razure of oblivion Give me your hand
and let the subject see to make them know
that outward courtesies would fain proclaim
favours that keep within Come Escalus
you must walk by us on our other hand
and good supporters are you


now is your time speak loud and kneel before him

justice O royal duke Vail your regard
upon a wrong'd I'd fain have said a maid
O worthy prince dishonour not your eye
by throwing it on any other object
till you have heard me in my true complaint
and given me justice justice justice justice

relate your wrongs in what by whom Be brief
here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice

O worthy duke
you bid me seek redemption of the devil
hear me yourself for that which I must speak
must either punish me not being believ'd
or wring redress from you Hear me O hear me here

my lord her wits I fear me are not firm
she hath been a suitor to me for her brother
cut off by course of justice

by course of justice

and she will speak most bitterly and strange

most strange but yet most truly will I speak
that Angelo's forsworn is it not strange
that Angelo's a murderer is't not strange
that Angelo is an adulterous thief
is it not strange and strange

nay it is ten times strange

it is not truer he is Angelo
than this is all as true as it is strange
nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
to the end of reckoning

away with her poor soul
she speaks this in the infirmity of sense

O prince I conjure thee as thou believ'st
there is another comfort than this world
that thou neglect me not with that opinion
that I am touch'd with madness Make not impossible
that which but seems unlike Tis not impossible
but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground
may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
in all his dressings characts titles forms
be an arch-villain Believe it royal prince
if he be less he's nothing but he's more
had I more name for badness

by mine honesty
if she be mad as I believe no other
her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
such a dependency of thing on thing
as e'er I heard in madness

O gracious duke
harp not on that nor do not banish reason
for inequality but let your reason serve
to make the truth appear where it seems hid
and hide the false seems true

many that are not mad
have sure more lack of reason What would you say
I am the sister of one Claudio
condemn'd upon the act of fornication
to lose his head condemn'd by Angelo
I in probation of a sisterhood
was sent to by my brother one Lucio
as then the messenger

that's I an't like your Grace
I came to her from Claudio and desir'd her
to try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
for her poor brother's pardon

that's he indeed

you were not bid to speak

no my good lord
nor wish'd to hold my peace

pray you take note of it and when you have
a business for yourself pray heaven you then
be perfect

I warrant your honour

the warrant's for yourself take heed to it

this gentleman told somewhat of my tale

right

it may be right but you are in the wrong
to speak before your time Proceed

I went
to this pernicious caitiff deputy

that's somewhat madly spoken
pardon it
the phrase is to the matter

mended again the matter proceed

in brief to set the needless process by
how I persuaded how I pray'd and kneel'd
how he refell'd me and how I replied
for this was of much length the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter
he would not but by gift of my chaste body
to his concupiscible intemperate lust
release my brother and after much debatement
my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
and I did yield to him But the next morn betimes
his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
for my poor brother's head

this is most likely
O that it were as like as it is true

by heaven fond wretch thou know'st not what thou speak'st
or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
in hateful practice First his integrity
stands without blemish next it imports no reason
that with such vehemency he should pursue
faults proper to himself if he had so offended
he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
and not have cut him off Some one hath set you on
confess the truth and say by whose advice
thou cam'st here to complain

and is this all
then O you blessed ministers above
keep me in patience and with ripen'd time
unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
in countenance Heaven shield your Grace from woe
as I thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go
I know you'd fain be gone An officer
to prison with her Shall we thus permit
a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
on him so near us This needs must be a practice
who knew of your intent and coming hither

one that I would were here Friar Lodowick

a ghostly father belike Who knows that Lodowick

my lord I know him tis a meddling friar
I do not like the man had he been lay my lord
for certain words he spake against your Grace
in your retirement I had swing'd him soundly

words against me This' a good friar belike
and to set on this wretched woman here
against our substitute Let this friar be found

I saw them at the prison a saucy friar
a very scurvy fellow

bless'd be your royal Grace
I have stood by my lord and I have heard
your royal ear abus'd First hath this woman
most wrongfully accus'd your substitute
who is as free from touch or soil with her
as she from one ungot

we did believe no less
know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of

I know him for a man divine and holy
not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
as he's reported by this gentleman
and on my trust a man that never yet
did as he vouches misreport your Grace


well he in time may come to clear himself
but at this instant he is sick my lord
of a strange fever Upon his mere request
being come to knowledge that there was complaint
intended gainst Lord Angelo came I hither
to speak as from his mouth what he doth know
is true and false and what he with his oath
and all probation will make up full clear
whensoever he's convented First for this woman
to justify this worthy nobleman
so vulgarly and personally accus'd
her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
till she herself confess it

good friar let's hear it

do you not smile at this Lord Angelo
O heaven the vanity of wretched fools
in this I'll be impartial be you judge
of your own cause Is this the witness friar
first let her show her face and after speak

pardon my lord I will not show my face
until my husband bid me

what are you married

no my lord

are you a maid

no my lord

a widow then

neither my lord

are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife

my lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid widow nor wife

silence that fellow I would he had some cause
to prattle for himself

well my lord

my lord I do confess I ne'er was married
and I confess besides I am no maid
I have known my husband yet my husband knows not
that ever he knew me

he was drunk then my lord it can be no better

for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too

well my lord
this is no witness for Lord Angelo

now I come to't my lord
she that accuses him of fornication
in self-same manner doth accuse my husband
and charges him my lord with such a time
when I'll depose I had him in mine arms
with all th' effect of love

charges she moe than me

not that I know

no you say your husband

why just my lord and that is Angelo
who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body
but knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's


my husband bids me now I will unmask

this is that face thou cruel Angelo
which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on
this is the hand which with a vow'd contract
was fast belock'd in thine this is the body
that took away the match from Isabel
and did supply thee at thy garden-house
in her imagin'd person

know you this woman

carnally she says

sirrah no more

enough my lord

and five years since there was some speech of marriage
betwixt myself and her which was broke off
partly for that her promised proportions
came short of composition but in chief
for that her reputation was disvalu'd
in levity since which time of five years
I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
upon my faith and honour

noble prince
as there comes light from heaven and words from breath
as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
as words could make up vows and my good lord
but Tuesday night last gone in s garden-house
he knew me as a wife As this is true
let me in safety raise me from my knees
or else for ever be confixed here
a marble monument
I did but smile till now
now good my lord give me the scope of justice
my patience here is touch'd I do perceive
these poor informal women are no more
but instruments of some more mightier member
that sets them on Let me have way my lord
to find this practice out

ay with my heart
and punish them unto your height of pleasure
thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman
compact with her that's gone think'st thou thy oaths
though they would swear down each particular saint
were testimonies against his worth and credit
that's seal'd in approbation You Lord Escalus
sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
to find out this abuse whence tis deriv'd
there is another friar that set them on
let him be sent for
would he were here my lord for he indeed
hath set the women on to this complaint
your provost knows the place where he abides
and he may fetch him

go do it instantly

and you my noble and well-warranted cousin
whom it concerns to hear this matter forth
do with your injuries as seems you best
in any chastisement I for awhile will leave you
but stir not you till you have well determin'd
upon these slanderers

my lord we'll do it throughly

Signior Lucio did not you say you knew that
friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person


we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him We shall find this friar a notable fellow

as any in Vienna on my word

call that same Isabel here once again
I would speak with her


pray you my lord give me leave to question you shall see how I'll handle her

not better than he by her own report

say you

marry sir I think if you handled her privately she would sooner confess perchance publicly she'll be ashamed

I will go darkly to work with her



come on mistress here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said

my lord here comes the rascal I spoke of here with the provost

in very good time speak not you to him till we call upon you


mum

come sir Did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo they have confessed you did

'Tis false

how know you where you are

respect to your great place and let the devil
be sometime honour'd for his burning throne

the duke's in us and we will hear you speak
look you speak justly

boldly at least But O poor souls
come you to seek the lamb here of the fox
good night to your redress Is the duke gone
then is your cause gone too The duke's unjust
thus to retort your manifest appeal
and put your trial in the villain's mouth
which here you come to accuse

this is the rascal this is he I spoke of

why thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar
is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
and in the witness of his proper ear
to call him villain
to tax him with injustice take him hence
to the rack with him We'll touse you joint by joint
but we will know his purpose What unjust'

be not so hot the duke
dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
dare rack his own his subject am I not
nor here provincial My business in this state
made me a looker-on here in Vienna
where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
till it o'er-run the stew laws for all faults
but faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes
stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop
as much in mock as mark

slander to the state Away with him to prison

what can you vouch against him Signior Lucio
is this the man that you did tell us of
'Tis he my lord Come hither goodman bald-pate do you know me

I remember you sir by the sound of your voice I met you at the prison in the absence of the duke

O did you so And do you remember what you said of the duke

most notedly sir

do you so sir And was the duke a flesh-monger a fool and a coward as you then reported him to be

you must sir change persons with me ere you make that my report you indeed spoke so of him and much more much worse

O thou damnable fellow Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches

I protest I love the duke as I love myself

hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses

such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal
away with him to prison Lay bolts enough on him let him speak no more Away with those giglots too and with the other confederate companion


stay sir stay awhile

what resists he Help him Lucio

come sir come sir come sir foh sir Why you bald-pated lying rascal you must be hooded must you show your knave's visage with a pox to you show your sheepbiting face and be hanged an hour Will't not off


thou art the first knave that e'er made a duke
first provost let me bail these gentle three


Sneak not away sir for the friar and you
must have a word anon Lay hold on him

this may prove worse than hanging

we'll borrow place of him

sir by your leave
hast thou or word or wit or impudence
that yet can do thee office If thou hast
rely upon it till my tale be heard
and hold no longer out

O my dread lord
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness
to think I can be undiscernible
when I perceive your Grace like power divine
hath look'd upon my passes Then good prince
no longer session hold upon my shame
but let my trial be mine own confession
immediate sentence then and sequent death
is all the grace I beg

come hither Mariana

I was my lord

go take her hence and marry her instantly
do you the office friar which consummate
return him here again Go with him provost


my lord I am more amaz'd at his dishonour
than at the strangeness of it

come hither Isabel
your friar is now your prince as I was then
advertising and holy to your business
not changing heart with habit I am still
attorney'd at your service

O give me pardon
that I your vassal have employ'd and pain'd

you are pardon'd Isabel
and now dear maid be you as free to us
your brother's death I know sits at your heart
and you may marvel why I obscur'd myself
labouring to save his life and would not rather
make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
than let him so be lost O most kind maid
it was the swift celerity of his death
which I did think with slower foot came on
that brain'd my purpose but peace be with him
that life is better life past fearing death
than that which lives to fear make it your comfort
so happy is your brother

I do my lord


for this new-married man approaching here
your well-defended honour you must pardon
for Mariana's sake But as he adjudg'd your brother
being criminal in double violation
of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
thereon dependent for your brother's life
the very mercy of the law cries out
most audible even from his proper tongue
'An Angelo for Claudio death for death
haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
like doth quit like and Measure still for Measure
then Angelo thy fault's thus manifested
which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
we do condemn thee to the very block
where Claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste
away with him

O my most gracious lord
I hope you will not mock me with a husband

consenting to the safeguard of your honour
I thought your marriage fit else imputation
for that he knew you might reproach your life
and choke your good to come For his possessions
although by confiscation they are ours
we do instate and widow you withal
to buy you a better husband

O my dear lord
I crave no other nor no better man

never crave him we are definitive

gentle my liege

you do but lose your labour
away with him to death

now sir to you
O my good lord Sweet Isabel take my part
lend me your knees and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service

against all sense you do importune her
should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
her brother's ghost his paved bed would break
and take her hence in horror

Isabel
sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me
hold up your hands say nothing I'll speak all
they say best men are moulded out of faults
and for the most become much more the better
for being a little bad so may my husband
O Isabel will you not lend a knee

he dies for Claudio's death

look if it please you on this man condemn'd
as if my brother liv'd I partly think
a due sincerity govern'd his deeds
till he did look on me since it is so
let him not die My brother had but justice
in that he did the thing for which he died
for Angelo
his act did not o'ertake his bad intent
and must be buried but as an intent
that perish'd by the way Thoughts are no subjects
intents but merely thoughts

merely my lord

your suit's unprofitable stand up I say
I have bethought me of another fault
provost how came it Claudio was beheaded
at an unusual hour


had you a special warrant for the deed

no my good lord it was by private message

for which I do discharge you of your office
give up your keys

pardon me noble lord
I thought it was a fault but knew it not
yet did repent me after more advice
for testimony whereof one in the prison
that should by private order else have died
I have reserv'd alive

what's he

his name is Barnardine

go fetch him hither let me look upon him


I am sorry one so learned and so wise
as you Lord Angelo have still appear'd
should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
and lack of temper'd judgment afterward

I am sorry that such sorrow I procure
and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
that I crave death more willingly than mercy
'Tis my deserving and I do entreat it


which is that Barnardine

this my lord

there was a friar told me of this man
that apprehends no further than this world
and squar'st thy life according Thou'rt condemn'd
but for those earthly faults I quit them all
and pray thee take this mercy to provide
for better times to come Friar advise him
I leave him to your hand What muffled fellow's that

this is another prisoner that I sav'd
that should have died when Claudio lost his head
as like almost to Claudio as himself


if he be like your brother for his sake
is he pardon'd and for your lovely sake
give me your hand and say you will be mine
he is my brother too But fitter time for that
by this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe
methinks I see a quickening in his eye
well Angelo your evil quits you well
I find an apt remission in myself
and yet here's one in place I cannot pardon


you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward
one all of luxury an ass a madman
wherein have I so deserv'd of you
that you extol me thus

'Faith my lord I spoke it but according to the trick If you will hang me for it you may but I had rather it would please you I might be whipped

whipp'd first sir and hang'd after
proclaim it provost round about the city
if any woman's wrong'd by this lewd fellow
as I have heard him swear himself there's one
whom he begot with child let her appear
and he shall marry her the nuptial finish'd
let him be whipp'd and hang'd


upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
thy slanders I forgive and therewithal
remit thy other forfeits Take him to prison
and see our pleasure herein executed

marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping and hanging

slandering a prince deserves it
she Claudio that you wrong'd look you restore
joy to you Mariana love her Angelo
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue
thanks good friend Escalus for thy much goodness
there's more behind that is more gratulate
thanks provost for thy care and secrecy
we shall employ thee in a worthier place
forgive him Angelo that brought you home
the head of Ragozine for Claudio's
the offence pardons itself Dear Isabel
whereto if you'll a willing ear incline
what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine
so bring us to our palace where we'll show
what's yet behind that's meet you all should know

MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING

I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina

he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when I left him

how many gentlemen have you lost in this action

but few of any sort and none of name

a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio

much deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how


I have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness

did he break out into tears

in great measure

a kind overflow of kindness There are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping

I pray you is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no

I know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort

what is he that you ask for niece

my cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua

O he is returned and as pleasant as ever he was


faith niece you tax Signior Benedick too much but he'll be meet with you I doubt it not

he hath done good service lady in these wars

you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach

and a good soldier too lady

and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord

a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues

it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing well we are all mortal

you must not sir mistake my niece There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them

alas he gets nothing by that In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature Who is his companion now He hath every month a new sworn brother


very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block

I see lady the gentleman is not in your books

no an he were I would burn my study But I pray you who is his companion Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil

he is most in the company of the right noble Claudio

O Lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad God help the noble Claudio if he have caught the Benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a' be cured

I will hold friends with you lady

do good friend

you will never run mad niece

no not till a hot January



good Signior Leonato you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it

never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave

you embrace your charge too willingly I think this is your daughter

her mother hath many times told me so

were you in doubt sir that you asked her

Signior Benedick no for then you were a child

you have it full Benedick we may guess by this what you are being a man Truly the lady fathers herself Be happy lady for you are like an honourable father

if Signior Leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina as like him as she is

I wonder that you will still be talking Signior Benedick nobody marks you
what my dear Lady Disdain are you yet living

is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence

then is courtesy a turncoat But it is certain I am loved of all ladies only you excepted and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart for truly I love none

a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humour for that I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me

God keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face

scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as yours were

well you are a rare parrot-teacher

a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours

I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer But keep your way i' God's name I have done

you always end with a jade's trick I know you of old
this is the sum of all Leonato Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart

if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn

let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother I owe you all duty

I thank you I am not of many words but I thank you

please it your Grace lead on

your hand Leonato we will go together


Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato

I noted her not but I looked on her

is she not a modest young lady


no I pray thee speak in sober judgment

why i' faith methinks she's too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like her

thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her

would you buy her that you inquire after her

can the world buy such a jewel

yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter Come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song

in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on

I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter there's her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December But I hope you have no intent to turn husband have you

I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn to the contrary if Hero would be my wife



what secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonato's

I would your Grace would constrain me to tell

I charge thee on thy allegiance

you hear Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love With who now that is your Grace's part Mark how short his answer is with Hero Leonato's short daughter

if this were so so were it uttered

like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed God forbid it should be so

if my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be otherwise

amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy

you speak this to fetch me in my lord
by my troth I speak my thought

and in faith my lord I spoke mine

and by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine

that I love her I feel

that she is worthy I know

that I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake

thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty

and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will

that a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me up I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which I may go the finer I will live a bachelor

I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love
with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid

well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument

if I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam

well as time shall try
'In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke

the savage bull may but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write Here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign Here you may see Benedick the married man

if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn-mad

nay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice thou wilt quake for this shortly

I look for an earthquake too then

well you will temporize with the hours In the meantime good Signior Benedick repair to Leonato's commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation


to the tuition of God from my house if I had it

the sixth of July your loving friend Benedick

nay mock not mock not The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so I leave you


my liege your highness now may do me good

my love is thine to teach teach it but how
and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
any hard lesson that may do thee good

hath Leonato any son my lord

no child but Hero she's his only heir
dost thou affect her Claudio

when you went onward on this ended action
I looked upon her with a soldier's eye
that lik'd but had a rougher task in hand
than to drive liking to the name of love
but now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
have left their places vacant in their rooms
come thronging soft and delicate desires
all prompting me how fair young Hero is
saying I lik'd her ere I went to wars

thou wilt be like a lover presently
and tire the hearer with a book of words
if thou dost love fair Hero cherish it
and I will break with her and with her father
and thou shalt have her Was't not to this end
that thou began'st to twist so fine a story

how sweetly do you minister to love
that know love's grief by his complexion
I would have salv'd it with a longer treatise

what need the bridge much broader than the flood
the fairest grant is the necessity
look what will serve is fit tis once thou lov'st
and I will fit thee with the remedy
I know we shall have revelling to-night
I will assume thy part in some disguise
and tell fair Hero I am Claudio
and in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
and take her hearing prisoner with the force
and strong encounter of my amorous tale
then after to her father will I break
and the conclusion is she shall be thine
in practice let us put it presently


how now brother Where is my cousin your son Hath he provided this music


are they good

as the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward The prince and Count Claudio walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it

hath the fellow any wit that told you this

a good sharp fellow I will send for him and question him yourself

no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true Go you and tell her of it

cousins you know what you have to do O I cry you mercy friend go you with me and I will use your skill Good cousin have a care this busy time


what the good-year my lord why are you thus out of measure sad

there is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit

you should hear reason
and when I have heard it what blessing brings it

it not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance

I wonder that thou being as thou say'st thou art born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no man's jests eat when I have stomach and wait for no man's leisure sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no man's business laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humour

yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment You have of late stood out against your brother and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest

I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage If I had my mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I would do my liking in the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me

can you make no use of your discontent

I make all use of it for I use it only Who comes here

what news Borachio

I came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage

will it serve for any model to build mischief on What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness
marry it is your brother's right hand

who the most exquisite Claudio

even he

a proper squire And who and who which way looks he

marry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato

a very forward March-chick How came you to this

being entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a musty room comes me the prince and Claudio hand in hand in sad conference I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo Hero for himself and having obtained her give her to Count Claudio

come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow if I can cross him any way I bless myself every way You are both sure and will assist me

to the death my lord

to the death my lord
let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that I am subdued Would the cook were of my mind Shall we go prove what's to be done

we'll wait upon your lordship

was not Count John here at supper

I saw him not

how tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after

he is of a very melancholy disposition

he were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling

then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face

with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a' could get her good will

by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
in faith she's too curst

too curst is more than curst I shall lessen God's sending that way for it is said God sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none

so by being too curst God will send you no horns

just if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening Lord I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in the woollen

you may light on a husband that hath no beard

what should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man I am not for him therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward and lead his apes into hell

well then go you into hell

no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say Get you to heaven Beatrice get you to heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long

well niece I trust you will be ruled by your father

yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say Father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say Father as it please me
well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband

not till God make men of some other metal than earth Would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl No uncle I'll none Adam's sons are my brethren and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred

daughter remember what I told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer

the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer For hear me Hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a measure and a cinque-pace the first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly-modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque-pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave

cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly

I have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylight

the revellers are entering brother make good room

lady will you walk about with your friend

so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away

with me in your company
I may say so when I please

and when please you to say so

when I like your favour for God defend the lute should be like the case

my visor is Philemon's roof within the house is Jove

why then your visor should be thatch'd

speak low if you speak love


well I would you did like me

so would not I for your own sake for I have many ill qualities

which is one


I love you the better the hearers may cry Amen

God match me with a good dancer

amen

and God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done Answer clerk

no more words the clerk is answered

I know you well enough you are Signior Antonio

at a word I am not

I know you by the waggling of your head

to tell you true I counterfeit him


at a word I am not

come come do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit Can virtue hide itself Go to mum you are he graces will appear and there's an end

will you not tell me who told you so

no you shall pardon me

nor will you not tell me who you are

not now

that I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of the Hundred Merry Tales Well this was Signior Benedick that said so

what's he

I am sure you know him well enough


did he never make you laugh

I pray you what is he

why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet I would he had boarded me

when I know the gentleman I'll tell him what you say

do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night

we must follow the leaders

in every good thing

nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next turning


sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it The ladies follow her and but one visor remains
and that is Claudio I know him by his bearing

are you not Signior Benedick

you know me well I am he

Signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on Hero I pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it

how know you he loves her

I heard him swear his affection

so did I too and he swore he would marry her to-night

come let us to the banquet


thus answer I in name of Benedick
but hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio
friendship is constant in all other things
save in the office and affairs of love
therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
let every eye negotiate for itself
and trust no agent for beauty is a witch
against whose charms faith melteth into blood
this is an accident of hourly proof
which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero


count Claudio

yea the same

come will you go with me

whither

even to the next willow about your own business count What fashion will you wear the garland of About your neck like a usurer's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf You must wear it one way for the prince hath got your Hero
I wish him joy of her

why that's spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks But did you think the prince would have served you thus

I pray you leave me

ho now you strike like the blind man twas the boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post

if it will not be I'll leave you


alas poor hurt fowl Now will he creep into sedges But that my lady Beatrice should know me and not know me The prince's fool Ha it may be I go under that title because I am merry Yea but so I am apt to do myself wrong I am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out Well I'll be revenged as I may


now signior where's the count Did you see him

troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him and I think I told him true that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady and I offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped

to be whipped What's his fault
the flat transgression of a school-boy who being overjoy'd with finding a bird's nest shows it his companion and he steals it

wilt thou make a trust a transgression The transgression is in the stealer

yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as I take it have stolen his bird's nest

I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner

if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly

the Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you

O she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her She told me not thinking I had been myself that I was the prince's jester that I was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me She speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made Hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too Come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follow her


look here she comes

will your Grace command me any service to the world's end I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia bring you the length of Prester John's foot fetch you a hair off the Great Cham's beard do you any embassage to the Pigmies rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy You have no employment for me


O God sir here's a dish I love not I cannot endure my Lady Tongue


come lady come you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick

indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and I gave him use for it a double heart for a single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it

you have put him down lady you have put him down

so I would not he should do me my lord lest I should prove the mother of fools I have brought Count Claudio whom you sent me to seek

why how now count wherefore are you sad

not sad my lord

how then Sick

neither my lord
the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion

i' faith lady I think your blazon to be true though I'll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false Here Claudio I have wooed in thy name and fair Hero is won I have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and God give thee joy

count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his Grace hath made the match and all grace say Amen to it

speak count tis your cue

silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little happy if I could say how much Lady as you are mine I am yours I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange

speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither

in faith lady you have a merry heart

yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart

and so she doth cousin

good Lord for alliance Thus goes every one to the world but I and I am sunburnt I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband
lady Beatrice I will get you one

I would rather have one of your father's getting Hath your Grace ne'er a brother like you Your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them

will you have me lady

no my lord unless I might have another for working days your Grace is too costly to wear every day But I beseech your Grace pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matter

your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour

no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was I born Cousins God give you joy

niece will you look to those things I told you of

I cry you mercy uncle By your Grace's pardon


by my troth a pleasant-spirited lady


she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband

O by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit

she were an excellent wife for Benedick

O Lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad

count Claudio when mean you to go to church

to-morrow my lord Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites

not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just seven-night and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind

come you shake the head at so long a breathing but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go dully by us I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours which is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other I would fain have it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction

my lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights' watchings


and you too gentle Hero

I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband

and Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty I will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I with your two helps will so practise on Benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only love-gods Go in with me and I will tell you my drift


it is so the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato

yea my lord but I can cross it

any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine How canst thou cross this marriage

not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me

show me briefly how

I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting-gentlewoman to Hero
I remember

I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber-window

what life is in that to be the death of this marriage

the poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as Hero

what proof shall I make of that

proof enough to misuse the prince to vex Claudio to undo Hero and kill Leonato
look you for any other issue

only to despite them I will endeavour any thing

go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio as in love of your brother's honour who hath made this match and his friend's reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid that you have discovered thus They will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown

grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats


I will presently go learn their day of marriage


boy


Signior

in my chamber-window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard

I am here already sir

I know that but I would have thee hence and here again [Exit Boy ] I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthographer his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but I'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be that's certain wise or I'll none virtuous or I'll never cheapen her fair or I'll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please God Ha the prince and Monsieur Love I will hide me in the arbour

come shall we hear this music

yea my good lord How still the evening is
as hush'd on purpose to grace harmony
see you where Benedick hath hid himself

O very well my lord the music ended
we'll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth

come Balthazar we'll hear that song again

O good my lord tax not so bad a voice
to slander music any more than once

it is the witness still of excellency
to put a strange face on his own perfection
I pray thee sing and let me woo no more

because you talk of wooing I will sing
since many a wooer doth commence his suit
to her he thinks not worthy yet he woos
yet will he swear he loves

or if thou wilt hold longer argument
do it in notes

note this before my notes
there's not a note of mine that's worth the noting

why these are very crotchets that he speaks
notes notes forsooth and nothing


now divine air now is his soul ravished Is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies Well a horn for my money when all's done

sigh no more ladies sigh no more
men were deceivers ever
one foot in sea and one on shore
to one thing constant never
then sigh not so
but let them go
and be you blithe and bonny
into Hey nonny nonny
sing no more ditties sing no mo
of dumps so dull and heavy
the fraud of men was ever so
since summer first was leavy
then sigh not so
but let them go
and be you blithe and bonny
converting all your sounds of woe
into Hey nonny nonny


by my troth a good song

and an ill singer my lord

ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift

an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief I had as lief have heard the night-raven come what plague could have come after it
yea marry dost thou hear Balthazar I pray thee get us some excellent music for to-morrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window

the best I can my lord

do so farewell

come hither Leonato what was it you told me of to-day that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick

O ay

stalk on stalk on the fowl sits I did never think that lady would have loved any man

no nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor

is't possible Sits the wind in that corner

by my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought

may be she doth but counterfeit
faith like enough

O God counterfeit There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it

why what effects of passion shows she

bait the hook well this fish will bite

what effects my lord She will sit you

you heard my daughter tell you how

she did indeed

how how I pray you You amaze me I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection

I would have sworn it had my lord especially against Benedick

I should think this a gull but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide itself in such reverence
he hath ta'en the infection hold it up

hath she made her affection known to Benedick

no and swears she never will that's her torment

'Tis true indeed so your daughter says Shall I says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that I love him

this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all

now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of

O when she had writ it and was reading it over she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet

that

O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her I measure him says she by my own spirit for I should flout him if he writ to me yea though I love him I should

then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses O sweet Benedick God give me patience
she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself It is very true

it were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it

to what end he would but make a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse

an he should it were an alms to hang him She's an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous

and she is exceeding wise

in everything but in loving Benedick

O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian

I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what a' will say

were it good think you

Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness
she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible he'll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit

he is a very proper man

he hath indeed a good outward happiness

'Fore God and in my mind very wise

he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit

and I take him to be valiant

as Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear

if he do fear God a' must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling

and so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love

never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel
nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first

well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy to have so good a lady

my lord will you walk dinner is ready

if he do not dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation

let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage and no such matter that's the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumbshow Let us send her to call him in to dinner


this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne They have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair tis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous tis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day she's a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her


against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner

fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains

I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful I would not have come
you take pleasure then in the message

yea just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior fare you well


ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner there's a double meaning in that I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me that's as much as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture

good Margaret run thee to the parlour
there shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
proposing with the prince and Claudio
whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula
walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
is all of her say that thou overheard'st us
and bid her steal into the pleached bower
where honey-suckles ripen'd by the sun
forbid the sun to enter like favourites
made proud by princes that advance their pride
against that power that bred it There will she hide her
to listen our propose This is thy office

I'll make her come I warrant you presently


now Ursula when Beatrice doth come
as we do trace this alley up and down
our talk must only be of Benedick
when I do name him let it be thy part
to praise him more than ever man did merit
my talk to thee must be how Benedick
is sick in love with Beatrice of this matter
is little Cupid's crafty arrow made
that only wounds by hearsay


now begin
for look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs

close by the ground to hear our conference
the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
cut with her golden oars the silver stream
and greedily devour the treacherous bait
so angle we for Beatrice who even now
is couched in the woodbine coverture
fear you not my part of the dialogue

then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
of the false sweet bait that we lay for it

no truly Ursula she is too disdainful
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
as haggerds of the rock

but are you sure
that Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely

so says the prince and my new-trothed lord


they did entreat me to acquaint her of it
but I persuaded them if they lov'd Benedick
to wish him wrestle with affection
and never to let Beatrice know of it

why did you so Doth not the gentleman
deserve as full as fortunate a bed
as ever Beatrice shall couch upon

O god of love I know he doth deserve
as much as may be yielded to a man
but nature never fram'd a woman's heart
of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice
disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
misprising what they look on and her wit
values itself so highly that to her
all matter else seems weak She cannot love
nor take no shape nor project of affection

sure I think so
and therefore certainly it were not good
she knew his love lest she make sport at it

why you speak truth I never yet saw man
how wise how noble young how rarely featur'd
but she would spell him backward if fair-fac'd
she would swear the gentleman should be her sister
if black why Nature drawing of an antick
made a foul blot if tall a lance ill-headed
if low an agate very vilely cut
if speaking why a vane blown with all winds
if silent why a block moved with none
so turns she every man the wrong side out
and never gives to truth and virtue that
which simpleness and merit purchaseth

sure sure such carping is not commendable
no not to be so odd and from all fashions
as Beatrice is cannot be commendable
but who dare tell her so If I should speak
she would mock me into air O she would laugh me
out of myself press me to death with wit
therefore let Benedick like cover'd fire
consume away in sighs waste inwardly
it were a better death than die with mocks
which is as bad as die with tickling

yet tell her of it hear what she will say

no rather I will go to Benedick
and counsel him to fight against his passion
and truly I'll devise some honest slanders
to stain my cousin with One doth not know
how much an ill word may empoison liking

O do not do your cousin such a wrong
having so swift and excellent a wit
as she is priz'd to have as to refuse
so rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick

he is the only man of Italy
always excepted my dear Claudio

I pray you be not angry with me madam
speaking my fancy Signior Benedick
for shape for bearing argument and valour
goes foremost in report through Italy

indeed he hath an excellent good name

his excellence did earn it ere he had it
when are you married madam

why every day to-morrow Come go in
I'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel

she's lim'd I warrant you we have caught her madam

if it prove so then loving goes by haps
some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps


what fire is in mine ears Can this be true
stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much
contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
no glory lives behind the back of such
and Benedick love on I will requite thee
taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
to bind our loves up in a holy band
for others say thou dost deserve and I
believe it better than reportingly



I'll bring you thither my lord if you'll vouchsafe me

nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at him He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks

gallants I am not as I have been

so say I methinks you are sadder

I hope he be in love

hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love If he be sad he wants money

I have the tooth-ache

draw it

hang it


what sigh for the tooth-ache

where is but a humour or a worm

well every one can master a grief but he that has it

yet say I he is in love

there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman to-day a Frenchman to-morrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is

if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a' brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode

hath any man seen him at the barber's

no but the barber's man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-balls

indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard


that's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love

the greatest note of it is his melancholy

and when was he wont to wash his face

yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say of him

nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute-string and new-governed by stops

indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude he is in love

nay but I know who loves him

that would I know too I warrant one that knows him not

yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him


yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache
old signior walk aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobby-horses must not hear


for my life to break with him about Beatrice

'Tis even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet


my lord and brother God save you

good den brother

if your leisure served I would speak with you

in private

if it please you yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns him
what's the matter

means your lordship to be married to-morrow

you know he does

I know not that when he knows what I know

if there be any impediment I pray you discover it

you may think I love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother I think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill-spent and labour ill bestowed

why what's the matter

I came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened for she hath been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal

who Hero

even she Leonato's Hero your Hero every man's Hero
disloyal

the word's too good to paint out her wickedness I could say she were worse think you of a worse title and I will fit her to it Wonder not till further warrant go but with me to-night you shall see her chamber-window entered even the night before her wedding-day if you love her then to-morrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind

may this be so

I will not think it

if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know If you will follow me I will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly

if I see any thing to-night why I should not marry her to-morrow in the congregation where I should wed there will I shame her

and as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with thee to disgrace her

I will disparage her no further till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself

O day untowardly turned

O mischief strangely thwarting
O plague right well prevented So will you say when you have seen the sequel


are you good men and true

yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul

nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince's watch

well give them their charge neighbour Dogberry

first who think you the most desartless man to be constable

Hugh Oatcake sir or George Seacoal for they can write and read

come hither neighbour Seacoal God hath blessed you with a good name to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature

both which Master constable


how if a' will not stand

why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave

if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the prince's subjects

true and they are to meddle with none but the prince's subjects You shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured

we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch

why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen Well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed

how if they will not

why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for

well sir


if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him

truly by your office you may but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled The most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company

you have been always called a merciful man partner

truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him

if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it

how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us

why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats

'Tis very true

this is the end of the charge You constable are to present the prince's own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him


five shillings to one on't with any man that knows the statues he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will

by r lady I think it be so

ha ah ha Well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows' counsels and your own and good night Come neighbour

well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two and then all go to bed

one word more honest neighbours I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door for the wedding being there to-morrow there is a great coil to-night Adieu be vigitant I beseech you

what Conrade

peace stir not

Conrade I say

here man I am at thy elbow


I will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale

stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles rain and I will like a true drunkard utter all to thee

some treason masters yet stand close

therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats

is it possible that any villany should be so dear

thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will

I wonder at it

that shows thou art unconfirmed Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man

yes it is apparel


yes the fashion is the fashion

tush I may as well say the fool's the fool But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is

I know that Deformed a' has been a vile thief this seven years a' goes up and down like a gentleman I remember his name

didst thou not hear somebody

no twas the vane on the house

seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty sometime fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god Bel's priests in the old church-window sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry where his cod-piece seems as massy as his club

all this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion

not so neither but know that I have to-night wooed Margaret the Lady Hero's gentlewoman by the name of Hero she leans me out at her mistress' chamber-window bids me a thousand times good night I tell this tale vilely I should first tell thee how the prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter

and thought they Margaret was Hero


we charge you in the prince's name stand

call up the right Master constable We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth

and one Deformed is one of them I know him a' wears a lock

masters masters

you'll be made bring Deformed forth I warrant you

masters

never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us

we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these men's bills

a commodity in question I warrant you Come we'll obey you

good Ursula wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise

I will lady

and bid her come hither

well


troth I think your other rabato were better

no pray thee good Meg I'll wear this

by my troth's not so good and I warrant your cousin will say so

my cousin's a fool and thou art another I'll wear none but this

I like the new tire within excellently if the hair were a thought browner and your gown's a most rare fashion i' faith I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so


by my troth's but a night-gown in respect of yours cloth o' gold and cuts and laced with silver set with pearls down sleeves side sleeves and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel but for a fine quaint graceful and excellent fashion yours is worth ten on't

God give me joy to wear it for my heart is exceeding heavy

'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man

fie upon thee art not ashamed

of what lady of speaking honourably is not marriage honourable in a beggar Is not your lord honourable without marriage I think you would have me say saving your reverence a husband an bad thinking do not wrest true speaking I'll offend nobody Is there any harm in the heavier for a husband None I think an it be the right husband and the right wife otherwise tis light and not heavy ask my Lady Beatrice else here she comes


good morrow coz

good morrow sweet Hero

why how now do you speak in the sick tune

I am out of all other tune methinks
clap's into Light o' love that goes without a burden do you sing it and I'll dance it

ye light o' love with your heels then if your husband have stables enough you'll see he shall lack no barns

O illegitimate construction I scorn that with my heels

'Tis almost five o'clock cousin tis time you were ready By my troth I am exceeding ill Heigh-ho

for a hawk a horse or a husband

for the letter that begins them all H

well an you be not turned Turk there's no more sailing by the star

what means the fool trow

nothing I but God send every one their heart's desire

these gloves the count sent me they are an excellent perfume
I am stuffed cousin I cannot smell

a maid and stuffed there's goodly catching of cold

O God help me God help me how long have you professed apprehension

ever since you left it Doth not my wit become me rarely

it is not seen enough you should wear it in your cap By my troth I am sick

get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus and lay it to your heart it is the only thing for a qualm

there thou prick'st her with a thistle

Benedictus why Benedictus you have some moral in this Benedictus

moral no by my troth I have no moral meaning I meant plain holy-thistle You may think perchance that I think you are in love nay by'r lady I am not such a fool to think what I list nor I list not to think what I can nor indeed I cannot think if I would think my heart out of thinking that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love Yet Benedick was such another and now is he become a man he swore he would never marry and yet now in despite of his heart he eats his meat without grudging and how you may be converted I know not but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do

what pace is this that thy tongue keeps
not a false gallop


madam withdraw the prince the count Signior Benedick Don John and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church

help to dress me good coz good Meg good Ursula


what would you with me honest neighbour

marry sir I would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly

brief I pray you for you see it is a busy time with me

marry this it is sir

yes in truth it is sir

what is it my good friends
goodman Verges sir speaks a little off the matter an old man sir and his wits are not so blunt as God help I would desire they were but in faith honest as the skin between his brows

yes I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I

comparisons are odorous palabras neighbour Verges

neighbours you are tedious

it pleases your worship to say so but we are the poor duke's officers but truly for mine own part if I were as tedious as a king I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship

all thy tediousness on me ha

yea an't were a thousand pound more than tis for I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city and though I be but a poor man I am glad to hear it

and so am I

I would fain know what you have to say

marry sir our watch to-night excepting your worship's presence ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina
a good old man sir he will be talking as they say when the age is in the wit is out God help us it is a world to see Well said i' faith neighbour Verges well God's a good man an two men ride of a horse one must ride behind An honest soul i' faith sir by my troth he is as ever broke bread but God is to be worshipped all men are not alike alas good neighbour

indeed neighbour he comes too short of you

gifts that God gives

I must leave you

one word sir our watch sir hath indeed comprehended two aspicious persons and we would have them this morning examined before your worship

take their examination yourself and bring it me I am now in great haste as may appear unto you

it shall be suffigance

drink some wine ere you go fare you well


my lord they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband



go good partner go get you to Francis Seacoal bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol we are now to examination these men

and we must do it wisely

we will spare for no wit I warrant you here's that shall drive some of them to a non-come only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the gaol

come Friar Francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards

you come hither my lord to marry this lady

no

to be married to her friar you come to marry her

lady you come hither to be married to this count

I do
if either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined I charge you on your souls to utter it

know you any Hero

none my lord

know you any count

I dare make his answer none

O what men dare do what men may do what men daily do not knowing what they do

how now Interjections Why then some be of laughing as ah ha he

stand thee by friar Father by your leave
will you with free and unconstrained soul
give me this maid your daughter

as freely son as God did give her me
and what have I to give you back whose worth
may counterpoise this rich and precious gift

nothing unless you render her again

sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
there Leonato take her back again
give not this rotten orange to your friend
she's but the sign and semblance of her honour
behold how like a maid she blushes here
O what authority and show of truth
can cunning sin cover itself withal
comes not that blood as modest evidence
to witness simple virtue Would you not swear
all you that see her that she were a maid
by these exterior shows But she is none
she knows the heat of a luxurious bed
her blush is guiltiness not modesty


not to be married
not to knit my soul to an approved wanton

dear my lord if you in your own proof
have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth
and made defeat of her virginity

I know what you would say if I have known her
you'll say she did embrace me as a husband
and so extenuate the forehand sin
no Leonato
I never tempted her with word too large
but as a brother to his sister show'd
bashful sincerity and comely love

and seem'd I ever otherwise to you

out on thee Seeming I will write against it
as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
but you are more intemperate in your blood
than Venus or those pamper'd animals
that rage in savage sensuality

is my lord well that he doth speak so wide

sweet prince why speak not you

what should I speak
I stand dishonour'd that have gone about
to link my dear friend to a common stale

are these things spoken or do I but dream

sir they are spoken and these things are true

this looks not like a nuptial


Leonato stand I here
is this the prince Is this the prince's brother
is this face Hero's Are our eyes our own

all this is so but what of this my lord

let me but move one question to your daughter
and by that fatherly and kindly power
that you have in her bid her answer truly

I charge thee do so as thou art my child

O God defend me how am I beset
what kind of catechizing call you this

to make you answer truly to your name

is it not Hero Who can blot that name

marry that can Hero
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue
what man was he talk'd with you yesternight
out at your window betwixt twelve and one
now if you are a maid answer to this

I talk'd with no man at that hour my lord

why then are you no maiden Leonato
I am sorry you must hear upon mine honour
myself my brother and this grieved count
did see her hear her at that hour last night
talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
confess'd the vile encounters they have had
a thousand times in secret

fie fie they are not to be nam'd my lord
there is not chastity enough in language
without offence to utter them Thus pretty lady
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment

O Hero what a Hero hadst thou been
if half thy outward graces had been plac'd
about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
thou pure impiety and impious purity
for thee I'll lock up all the gates of love
and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
and never shall it more be gracious

hath no man's dagger here a point for me


why how now cousin wherefore sink you down

smother her spirits up


how doth the lady

dead I think help uncle
Hero why Hero Uncle Signior Benedick
friar

O Fate take not away thy heavy hand
death is the fairest cover for her shame
that may be wish'd for

how now cousin Hero

have comfort lady

dost thou look up


wherefore Why doth not every earthly thing
cry shame upon her Could she here deny
the story that is printed in her blood
do not live Hero do not ope thine eyes
for did I think thou wouldst not quickly die
thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
myself would on the rearward of reproaches
strike at thy life Griev'd I I had but one
chid I for that at frugal nature's frame
O one too much by thee Why had I one
why ever wast thou lovely in mine eyes
why had I not with charitable hand
took up a beggar's issue at my gates
who smirched thus and mir'd with infamy
I might have said No part of it is mine
this shame derives itself from unknown loins
but mine and mine I lov'd and mine I prais'd
and mine that I was proud on mine so much
valuing of her why she O she is fallen
into a pit of ink that the wide sea
hath drops too few to wash her clean again
and salt too little which may season give
to her foul-tainted flesh

sir sir be patient
for my part I am so attir'd in wonder
I know not what to say

O on my soul my cousin is belied

lady were you her bedfellow last night

no truly not although until last night
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow

confirm'd confirm'd O that is stronger made
which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron
who lov'd her so that speaking of her foulness
wash'd it with tears Hence from her let her die

hear me a little
for I have only been silent so long
and given way unto this course of fortune
by noting of the lady I have mark'd
a thousand blushing apparitions
to start into her face a thousand innocent shames
in angel whiteness bear away those blushes
and in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
to burn the errors that these princess hold
against her maiden truth Call me a fool
trust not my reading nor my observations
which with experimental seal doth warrant
the tenour of my book trust not my age
my reverence calling nor divinity
if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
under some biting error
friar it cannot be
thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
is that she will not add to her damnation
a sin of perjury she not denies it
why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
that which appears in proper nakedness

lady what man is he you are accus'd of

they know that do accuse me I know none
if I know more of any man alive
than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
let all my sins lack mercy O my father
prove you that any man with me convers'd
at hours unmeet or that I yesternight
maintain'd the change of words with any creature
refuse me hate me torture me to death

there is some strange misprision in the princes
two of them have the very bent of honour
and if their wisdoms be misled in this
the practice of it lives in John the bastard
whose spirits toil in frame of villanies

I know not If they speak but truth of her
these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour
the proudest of them shall well hear of it
time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
nor age so eat up my invention
nor fortune made such havoc of my means
nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
but they shall find awak'd in such a kind
both strength of limb and policy of mind
ability in means and choice of friends
to quit me of them throughly

pause awhile
and let my counsel sway you in this case
let her awhile be secretly kept in
and publish it that she is dead indeed
maintain a mourning ostentation
and on your family's old monument
hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
that appertain unto a burial

what shall become of this What will this do

marry this well carried shall on her behalf
change slander to remorse that is some good
but not for that dream I on this strange course
but on this travail look for greater birth
she dying as it must be so maintain'd
upon the instant that she was accus'd
shall be lamented pitied and excus'd
of every hearer for it so falls out
that what we have we prize not to the worth
whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost
the virtue that possession would not show us
whiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio
when he shall hear she died upon his words
the idea of her life shall sweetly creep
into his study of imagination
and every lovely organ of her life
shall come apparell'd in more precious habit
more moving-delicate and full of life
into the eye and prospect of his soul
than when she liv'd indeed then shall he mourn
if ever love had interest in his liver
and wish he had not so accused her
no though he thought his accusation true
let this be so and doubt not but success
will fashion the event in better shape
than I can lay it down in likelihood
but if all aim but this be levell'd false
the supposition of the lady's death
will quench the wonder of her infamy
as best befits her wounded reputation
in some reclusive and religious life
out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries

Signior Leonato let the friar advise you
and though you know my inwardness and love
is very much unto the prince and Claudio
yet by mine honour I will deal in this
as secretly and justly as your soul
should with your body

being that I flow in grief
the smallest twine may lead me

'Tis well consented presently away
for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
come lady die to live this wedding day
perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure

lady Beatrice have you wept all this while

yea and I will weep a while longer

I will not desire that

you have no reason I do it freely

surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged

Ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her

is there any way to show such friendship

a very even way but no such friend

may a man do it

it is a man's office but not yours
I do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange

as strange as the thing I know not
it were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as your but believe me not and yet I lie not I confess nothing not I deny nothing I am sorry for my cousin

by my sword Beatrice thou lovest me

do not swear by it and eat it

I will swear by it that you love me and I will make him eat it that says I love not you

will you not eat your word

with no sauce that can be devised to it I protest I love thee

why then God forgive me

what offence sweet Beatrice

I was about to protest I loved you

and do it with all thy heart

I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest

come bid me do anything for thee

kill Claudio

ha not for the wide world

you kill me to deny it Farewell

tarry sweet Beatrice

I am gone though I am here there is no love in you nay I pray you let me go

Beatrice
in faith I will go

we'll be friends first

you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy

is Claudio thine enemy

is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman O that I were a man What bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour O God that I were a man I would eat his heart in the market-place

hear me Beatrice

talk with a man out at a window a proper saying

nay but Beatrice

sweet Hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone

beat
princes and counties Surely a princely testimony a goodly Count Comfect a sweet gallant surely O that I were a man for his sake or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake But manhood is melted into curtsies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it I cannot be a man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with grieving

tarry good Beatrice By this hand I love thee

use it for my love some other way than swearing by it

think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero

yea as sure as I have a thought or a soul

enough I am engaged I will challenge him I will kiss your hand and so leave you By this hand Claudio shall render me a dear account As you hear of me so think of me Go comfort your cousin I must say she is dead and so farewell


is our whole dissembly appeared

O a stool and a cushion for the sexton

which be the malefactors


nay that's certain we have the exhibition to examine

but which are the offenders that are to be examined let them come before Master constable

yea marry let them come before me
what is your name friend

Borachio

pray write down Borachio Yours sirrah

I am a gentleman sir and my name is Conrade

write down Master gentleman Conrade Masters do you serve God

yea sir we hope

yea sir we hope
write down that they hope they serve God and write God first for God defend but God should go before such villains Masters it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves and it will go near to be thought so shortly How answer you for yourselves

marry sir we say we are none

a marvellous witty fellow I assure you but I will go about with him Come you hither sirrah a word in your ear sir I say to you it is thought you are false knaves

sir I say to you we are none

well stand aside Fore God they are both in a tale Have you writ down that they are none

master constable you go not the way to examine you must call forth the watch that are their accusers

yea marry that's the eftest way Let the watch come forth Masters I charge you in the prince's name accuse these men

this man said sir that Don John the prince's brother was a villain

write down Prince John a villain
why this is flat perjury to call a prince's brother villain


pray thee fellow peace I do not like thy look I promise thee

what heard you him say else

marry that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully

flat burglary as ever was committed

yea by the mass that it is

what else fellow

and that Count Claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly and not marry her

O villain thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this

what else


and this is more masters than you can deny Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away Hero was in this manner accused in this very manner refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died Master constable let these men be bound and brought to Leonato's I will go before and show him their examination


come let them be opinioned

let them be in the hands

off coxcomb

God's my life where's the sexton let him write down the prince's officer coxcomb Come bind them Thou naughty varlet

away you are an ass you are an ass

dost thou not suspect my place Dost thou not suspect my years O that he were here to write me down an ass but masters remember that I am an ass though it be not written down yet forget not that I am an ass No thou villain thou art full of piety as shall be proved upon thee by good witness I am a wise fellow and which is more an officer and which is more a householder and which is more as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina and one that knows the law go to and a rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that hath had losses and one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him Bring him away O that I had been writ down an ass

if you go on thus you will kill yourself
and tis not wisdom thus to second grief
against yourself
I pray thee cease thy counsel
which falls into mine ears as profitless
as water in a sieve give not me counsel
nor let no comforter delight mine ear
but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
bring me a father that so lov'd his child
whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine
and bid him speak of patience
measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
and let it answer every strain for strain
as thus for thus and such a grief for such
in every lineament branch shape and form
if such a one will smile and stroke his beard
bid sorrow wag cry hem' when he should groan
patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
with candle-wasters bring him yet to me
and I of him will gather patience
but there is no such man for brother men
can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
their counsel turns to passion which before
would give preceptial medicine to rage
fetter strong madness in a silken thread
charm ache with air and agony with words
no no tis all men's office to speak patience
to those that wring under the load of sorrow
but no man's virtue nor sufficiency
to be so moral when he shall endure
the like himself Therefore give me no counsel
my griefs cry louder than advertisement

therein do men from children nothing differ

I pray thee peace I will be flesh and blood
for there was never yet philosopher
that could endure the toothache patiently
however they have writ the style of gods
and made a push at chance and sufferance

make those that do offend you suffer too

there thou speak'st reason nay I will do so
my soul doth tell me Hero is belied
and that shall Claudio know so shall the prince
and all of them that thus dishonour her

here come the prince and Claudio hastily


good den good den

good day to both of you

hear you my lords

we have some haste Leonato

some haste my lord well fare you well my lord

nay do not quarrel with us good old man

if he could right himself with quarrelling
some of us would lie low

who wrongs him

marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
I fear thee not

marry beshrew my hand
if it should give your age such cause of fear
in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword

tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool
as under privilege of age to brag
were I not old Know Claudio to thy head
thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
that I am forc'd to lay my reverence by
and with grey hairs and bruise of many days
do challenge thee to trial of a man
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child
thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
and she lies buried with her ancestors
O in a tomb where never scandal slept
save this of hers fram'd by thy villany

my villany

thine Claudio thine I say

you say not right old man

my lord my lord
I'll prove it on his body if he dare
his May of youth and bloom of lustihood

away I will not have to do with you

canst thou so daff me Thou hast kill'd my child
if thou kill'st me boy thou shalt kill a man

he shall kill two of us and men indeed
but that's no matter let him kill one first
win me and wear me let him answer me
come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me
sir boy I'll whip you from your foining fence
nay as I am a gentleman I will

brother

content yourself God knows I lov'd my niece
and she is dead slander'd to death by villains
that dare as well answer a man indeed
boys apes braggarts Jacks milksops

brother Antony

hold you content What man I know them yea
and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
scrambling out-facing fashion-monging boys
that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
go antickly show outward hideousness
and speak off half a dozen dangerous words
how they might hurt their enemies if they durst
and this is all

but brother Antony

come tis no matter
do not you meddle let me deal in this

gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
but on my honour she was charg'd with nothing
but what was true and very full of proof

my lord my lord

I will not hear you

no
come brother away I will be heard

and shall or some of us will smart for it

see see here comes the man we went to seek

now signior what news

good day my lord

welcome signior you are almost come to part almost a fray
we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth

Leonato and his brother What thinkest thou Had we fought I doubt we should have been too young for them

in a false quarrel there is no true valour I came to seek you both

we have been up and down to seek thee for we are high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away Wilt thou use thy wit

it is in my scabbard shall I draw it

dost thou wear thy wit by thy side

never any did so though very many have been beside their wit I will bid thee draw as we do the minstrels draw to pleasure us

as I am an honest man he looks pale Art thou sick or angry

what courage man What though care killed a cat thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care

sir I shall meet your wit in the career an you charge it against me I pray you choose another subject
nay then give him another staff this last was broke cross

by this light he changes more and more I think he be angry indeed

if he be he knows how to turn his girdle

shall I speak a word in your ear

God bless me from a challenge

you are a villain I jest not I will make it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dare Do me right or I will protest your cowardice You have killed a sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you Let me hear from you

well I will meet you so I may have good cheer

what a feast a feast

i' faith I thank him he hath bid me to a calf's-head and a capon the which if I do not carve most curiously say my knife's naught
shall I not find a woodcock too


I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day I said thou hadst a fine wit True says she a fine little one No said I a great wit Right said she a great gross one Nay said I a good wit Just said she it hurts nobody Nay said I the gentleman is wise Certain said she a wise gentleman Nay said I he hath the tongues That I believe said she for he swore a thing to me on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning there's a double tongue there's two tongues Thus did she an hour together trans-shape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou wast the properest man in Italy

for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not

yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly The old man's daughter told us all

all all and moreover God saw him when he was hid in the garden

but when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head

yea and text underneath Here dwells Benedick the married man

fare you well boy you know my mind I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour you break jests as braggarts do their blades which God be thanked hurt not My lord for your many courtesies I thank you I must discontinue your company Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady For my Lord Lack-beard there he and I shall meet and till then peace be with him


he is in earnest

in most profound earnest and I'll warrant you for the love of Beatrice
and hath challenged thee

most sincerely

what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit

he is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man

but soft you let me be pluck up my heart and be sad Did he not say my brother was fled


come you sir if justice cannot tame you she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance Nay an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be looked to

how now two of my brother's men bound Borachio one

hearken after their offence my lord

officers what offence have these men done


first I ask thee what they have done thirdly I ask thee what's their offence sixth and lastly why they are committed and to conclude what you lay to their charge

rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth there's one meaning well suited

who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be understood What's your offence

sweet prince let me go no further to mine answer do you hear me and let this count kill me I have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments how you disgraced her when you should marry her My villany they have upon record which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation and briefly I desire nothing but the reward of a villain

runs not this speech like iron through your blood

I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it

but did my brother set thee on to this

yea and paid me richly for the practice of it

he is compos'd and fram'd of treachery
and fled he is upon this villany
sweet Hero now thy image doth appear
in the rare semblance that I lov'd it first

come bring away the plaintiffs by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter And masters do not forget to specify when time and place shall serve that I am an ass

here here comes Master Signior Leonato and the sexton too


which is the villain Let me see his eyes
that when I note another man like him
I may avoid him Which of these is he

if you would know your wronger look on me

art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
mine innocent child

yea even I alone

here stand a pair of honourable men
a third is fled that had a hand in it
I thank you princes for my daughter's death
record it with your high and worthy deeds
'Twas bravely done if you bethink you of it

I know not how to pray your patience
yet I must speak Choose your revenge yourself
impose me to what penance your invention
can lay upon my sin yet sinn'd I not
but in mistaking

by my soul nor I
and yet to satisfy this good old man
I would bend under any heavy weight
that he'll enjoin me to

I cannot bid you bid my daughter live
that were impossible but I pray you both
how innocent she died and if your love
can labour aught in sad invention
hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
and sing it to her bones sing it to-night
to-morrow morning come you to my house
and since you could not be my son-in-law
be yet my nephew My brother hath a daughter
almost the copy of my child that's dead
and she alone is heir to both of us
give her the right you should have given her cousin
and so dies my revenge

O noble sir
your over-kindness doth wring tears from me
I do embrace your offer and dispose
for henceforth of poor Claudio

to-morrow then I will expect your coming
to-night I take my leave This naughty man
who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong
hir'd to it by your brother

no by my soul she was not
nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me
but always hath been just and virtuous
in anything that I do know by her

moreover sir which indeed is not under white and black this plaintiff here the offender did call me ass I beseech you let it be remembered in his punishment And also the watch heard them talk of one Deformed they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and borrows money in God's name the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing for God's sake Pray you examine him upon that point

I thank thee for thy care and honest pains

your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth and I praise God for you

there's for thy pains

God save the foundation

go I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank thee
I leave an arrant knave with your worship which I beseech your worship to corect yourself for the example of others God keep your worship I wish your worship well God restore you to health I humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry meeting may be wished God prohibit it Come neighbour


until to-morrow morning lords farewell

farewell my lords we look for you to-morrow

we will not fail

to-night I'll mourn with Hero


bring you these fellows on We'll talk with Margaret
how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow


pray thee sweet Mistress Margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice

will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty
in so high a style Margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it

to have no man come over me why shall I always keep below stairs

thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth it catches

and yours as blunt as the fencer's foils which hit but hurt not

a most manly wit Margaret it will not hurt a woman and so I pray thee call Beatrice I give thee the bucklers

give us the swords we have bucklers of our own

if you use them Margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids

well I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legs

and therefore will come


that sits above
and knows me and knows me
how pitiful I deserve

I mean in singing but in loving Leander the good swimmer Troilus the first employer of pandars and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love Marry I cannot show it in rime I have tried I can find out no rime to lady' but baby an innocent rime for scorn horn a hard rime for school fool a babbling rime very ominous endings no I was not born under a riming planet nor I cannot woo in festival terms

sweet Beatrice wouldst thou come when I called thee

yea signior and depart when you bid me

O stay but till then

'Then' is spoken fare you well now and yet ere I go let me go with that I came for which is with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio

only foul words and thereupon I will kiss thee

foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore I will depart unkissed

thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit But I must tell thee plainly Claudio undergoes my challenge and either I must shortly hear from him or I will subscribe him a coward And I pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me

'Suffer love a good epithet I do suffer love indeed for I love thee against my will

in spite of your heart I think Alas poor heart If you spite it for my sake I will spite it for yours for I will never love that which my friend hates

thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably

it appears not in this confession there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself

an old an old instance Beatrice that lived in the time of good neighbours If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps

and how long is that think you

question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore it is most expedient for the wise if Don Worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as I am to myself So much for praising myself who I myself will bear witness is praiseworthy And now tell me how doth your cousin

very ill

and how do you
very ill too

serve God love me and mend There will I leave you too for here comes one in haste


madam you must come to your uncle Yonder's old coil at home it is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused the prince and Claudio mightily abused and Don John is the author of all who is fled and gone Will you come presently

will you go hear this news signior

I will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried in thy eyes and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle's


is this the monument of Leonato

it is my lord

done to death by slanderous tongues
was the Hero that here lies
death in guerdon of her wrongs
so the life that died with shame
lives in doath with glorious fame

hang thou there upon the tomb
praising her when I am dumb
now music sound and sing your solemn hymn

pardon goddess of the night
those that slew thy virgin knight
for the which with songs of woe
round about her tomb they go
midnight assist our moan
help us to sigh and groan
heavily heavily
graves yawn and yield your dead
till death be uttered
heavily heavily

now unto thy bones good night

good morrow masters put your torches out
the wolves have prey'd and look the gentle day
before the wheels of Ph bus round about
dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
thanks to you all and leave us fare you well

good morrow masters each his several way

come let us hence and put on other weeds
and then to Leonato's we will go

and Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
than this for whom we render'd up this woe


did I not tell you she was innocent

so are the prince and Claudio who accus'd her
but Margaret was in some fault for this
although against her will as it appears
in the true course of all the question

well I am glad that all things sort so well

and so am I being else by faith enforc'd
to call young Claudio to a reckoning for it

well daughter and you gentlewomen all
withdraw into a chamber by yourselves
and when I send for you come hither mask'd
the prince and Claudio promis'd by this hour
to visit me

you know your office brother
you must be father to your brother's daughter
and give her to young Claudio


friar I must entreat your pains I think

to do what signior

to bind me or undo me one of them
Signior Leonato truth it is good signior
your niece regards me with an eye of favour

that eye my daughter lent her tis most true

and I do with an eye of love requite her

the sight whereof I think you had from me
from Claudio and the prince But what's your will

your answer sir is enigmatical
but for my will my will is your good will
may stand with ours this day to be conjoin'd
in which good friar I shall desire your help

my heart is with your liking

and my help
here come the prince and Claudio


good morrow to this fair assembly

good morrow prince good morrow Claudio
we here attend you Are you yet determin'd
to-day to marry with my brother's daughter

I'll hold my mind were she an Ethiop

call her forth brother here's the friar ready


that you have such a February face
so full of frost of storm and cloudiness

I think he thinks upon the savage bull
tush fear not man we'll tip thy horns with gold
and all Europa shall rejoice at thee
as once Europa did at lusty Jove
when he would play the noble beast in love

bull Jove sir had an amiable low
and some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow
and got a calf in that same noble feat
much like to you for you have just his bleat

for this I owe you here come other reckonings

which is the lady I must seize upon

this same is she and I do give you her
why then she's mine Sweet let me see your face

no that you shall not till you take her hand
before this friar and swear to marry her

give me your hand before this holy friar
I am your husband if you like of me

and when I liv'd I was your other wife

and when you lov'd you were my other husband

another Hero

nothing certainer
one Hero died defil'd but I do live
and surely as I live I am a maid

the former Hero Hero that is dead
she died my lord but whiles her slander liv'd

all this amazement can I qualify
when after that the holy rites are ended
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death
meantime let wonder seem familiar
and to the chapel let us presently

soft and fair friar Which is Beatrice

I answer to that name What is your will

do not you love me

why no no more than reason

why then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
have been deceived for they swore you did


troth no no more than reason

why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
are much deceiv'd for they did swear you did

they swore that you were almost sick for me

they swore that you were well-nigh dead for me

'Tis no such matter Then you do not love me

no truly but in friendly recompense

come cousin I am sure you love the gentleman

and I'll be sworn upon t that he loves her
for here's a paper written in his hand
a halting sonnet of his own pure brain

and here's another
writ in my cousin's hand stolen from her pocket
containing her affection unto Benedick

a miracle here's our own hands against our hearts Come I will have thee but by this light I take thee for pity

I would not deny you but by this good day I yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for I was told you were in a consumption

peace I will stop your mouth


how dost thou Benedick the married man

I'll tell thee what prince a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram No if a man will be beaten with brains a' shall wear nothing handsome about him In brief since I do purpose to marry I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion For thy part Claudio I did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin

I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life to make thee a double-dealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee

come come we are friends Let's have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels
we'll have dancing afterward

first of my word therefore play music Prince thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn


my lord your brother John is ta'en in flight
and brought with armed men back to Messina

think not on him till to-morrow I'll devise thee brave punishments for him Strike up pipers

PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE


to sing a song that old was sung
from ashes ancient Gower is come
assuming man's infirmities
to glad your ear and please your eyes
it hath been sung at festivals
on ember-eves and holy-ales
have read it for restoratives
the purchase is to make men glorious
et bonum quo antiquius eo melius
if you born in these latter times
when wit's more ripe accept my rimes
and that to hear an old man sing
may to your wishes pleasure bring
I life would wish and that I might
waste it for you like taper-light
this Antioch then Antiochus the Great
built up this city for his chiefest seat
the fairest in all Syria
I tell you what mine authors say
this king unto him took a fere
who died and left a female heir
so buxom blithe and full of face
as heaven had lent her all his grace
with whom the father liking took
and her to incest did provoke
to evil should be done by none
by custom what they did begin
was with long use account no sin
the beauty of this sinful dame
made many princes thither frame
to seek her as a bed-fellow
in marriage-pleasures play-fellow
which to prevent he made a law
to keep her still and men in awe
that whoso ask'd her for his wife
his riddle told not lost his life
so for her many a wight did die
as yon grim looks do testify
what now ensues to the judgment of your eye
I give my cause who best can justify


young Prince of Tyre you have at large receiv'd
the danger of the task you undertake
I have Antiochus and with a soul
embolden'd with the glory of her praise
think death no hazard in this enterprise

bring in our daughter clothed like a bride
for the embracements even of Jove himself
at whose conception till Lucina reign'd
nature this dowry gave to glad her presence
the senate-house of planets all did sit
to knit in her their best perfections

see where she comes apparell'd like the spring
graces her subjects and her thoughts the king
of every virtue gives renown to men
her face the book of praises where is read
nothing but curious pleasures as from thence
sorrow were ever raz'd and testy wrath
could never be her mild companion
you gods that made me man and sway in love
to taste the fruit of you celestial tree
or die in the adventure be my helps
as I am son and servant to your will
to compass such a boundless happiness

prince Pericles

that would be son to great Antiochus

before thee stands this fair Hesperides
with golden fruit but dangerous to be touch'd
for death-like dragons here affright thee hard
her face like heaven enticeth thee to view
her countless glory which desert must gain
and which without desert because thine eye
presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die
yon sometime famous princes like thyself
drawn by report adventurous by desire
tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale
they here stand martyrs slain in Cupid's wars
and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
for going on death's net whom none resist

Antiochus I thank thee who hath taught
my frail mortality to know itself
and by those fearful objects to prepare
this body like to them to what I must
for death remember'd should be like a mirror
who tells us life's but breath to trust it error
I'll make my will then and as sick men do
who know the world see heaven but feeling woe
gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did
so I bequeath a happy peace to you
and all good men as every prince should do
my riches to the earth from whence they came

but my unspotted fire of love to you
thus ready for the way of life or death

scorning advice read the conclusion then
which read and not expounded tis decreed
as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed

of all say'd yet mayst thou prove prosperous
of all say'd yet I wish thee happiness

like a bold champion I assume the lists
nor ask advice of any other thought
but faithfulness and courage

I am no viper yet I feed
on mother's flesh which did me breed
I sought a husband in which labour
I found that kindness in a father
he's father son and husband mild
I mother wife and yet his child
how they may be and yet in two

sharp physic is the last but O you powers
that give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts
why cloud they not their sights perpetually
if this be true which makes me pale to read it
fair glass of light I lov'd you and could still
were not this glorious casket stor'd with ill
but I must tell you now my thoughts revolt
for he's no man on whom perfections wait
that knowing sin within will touch the gate
you're a fair viol and your sense the strings
who finger'd to make men his lawful music
would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken
but being play'd upon before your time
hell only danceth at so harsh a chime
good sooth I care not for you

prince Pericles touch not upon thy life
for that's an article within our law
either expound now or receive your sentence

great king
few love to hear the sins they love to act
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it
who has a book of all that monarchs do
he's more secure to keep it shut than shown
for vice repeated is like the wandering wind
blows dust in others' eyes to spread itself
and yet the end of all is bought thus dear
the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear
to stop the air would hurt them The blind mole casts
copp'd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throng'd
by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for t
kings are earth's gods in vice their law's their will
and if Jove stray who dares say Jove doth ill
it is enough you know and it is fit
what being more known grows worse to smother it
all love the womb that their first being bred

heaven that I had thy head he has found the meaning
but I will gloze with him Young Prince of Tyre
though by the tenour of our strict edict
your exposition misinterpreting
we might proceed to cancel of your days
yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree
as your fair self doth tune us otherwise
forty days longer we do respite you
if by which time our secret be undone
this mercy shows we'll joy in such a son
and until then your entertain shall be
as doth befit our honour and your worth


how courtesy would seem to cover sin
when what is done is like a hypocrite
the which is good in nothing but in sight
if it be true that I interpret false
as with foul incest to abuse your soul
where now you're both a father and a son
by your untimely claspings with your child
which pleasure fits a husband not a father
and she an eater of her mother's flesh
by the defiling of her parent's bed
and both like serpents are who though they feed
on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed
Antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men
blush not in actions blacker than the night
will shun no course to keep them from the light
one sin I know another doth provoke
murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke
poison and treason are the hands of sin
ay and the targets to put off the shame
then lest my life be cropp'd to keep you clear
by flight I'll shun the danger which I fear

he hath found the meaning for which we mean
he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy
nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
in such a loathed manner
and therefore instantly this prince must die
for by his fall my honour must keep high
who attends us there


doth your highness call

Thaliard
you're of our chamber and our mind partakes
her private actions to your secrecy
and for your faithfulness we will advance you
Thaliard behold here's poison and here's gold
we hate the Prince of Tyre and thou must kill him
it fits thee not to ask the reason why
because we bid it Say is it done


enough

let your breath cool yourself telling your haste

my lord Prince Pericles is fled


as thou
wilt live fly after and as an arrow shot
from a well-experienc'd archer hits the mark
his eye doth level at so thou ne'er return
unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead

my lord
if I can get him within my pistol's length
I'll make him sure enough so farewell to your highness

Thaliard adieu
till Pericles be dead
my heart can lend no succour to my head


let none disturb us
why should this change of thoughts
the sad companion dull-ey'd melancholy
be my so us'd a guest as not an hour
in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night
the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet
here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them
and danger which I feared is at Antioch
whose arm seems far too short to hit me here
yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits
nor yet the other's distance comfort me
then it is thus the passions of the mind
that have their first conception by mis-dread
have after-nourishment and life by care
and what was first but fear what might be done
and so with me the great Antiochus
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend
since he's so great can make his will his act
will think me speaking though I swear to silence
nor boots it me to say I honour him
if he suspect I may dishonour him
and what may make him blush in being known
he'll stop the course by which it might be known
with hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land
and with the ostent of war will look so huge
amazement shall drive courage from the state
our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist
and subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence
which care of them not pity of myself
who am no more but as the tops of trees
which fence the roots they grow by and defend them
make both my body pine and soul to languish
and punish that before that he would punish

joy and all comfort in your sacred breast

and keep your mind till you return to us
peaceful and comfortable

peace peace and give experience tongue
they do abuse the king that flatter him
for flattery is the bellows blows up sin
the thing the which is flatter'd but a spark
to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing
whereas reproof obedient and in order
fits kings as they are men for they may err
when Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace
he flatters you makes war upon your life
prince pardon me or strike me if you please
I cannot be much lower than my knees

all leave us else but let your cares o'erlook
what shipping and what lading's in our haven

Helicanus thou
hast mov'd us what seest thou in our looks

an angry brow dread lord

if there be such a dart in prince's frowns
how durst thy tongue move anger to our face

how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence
they have their nourishment

thou know'st I have power
to take thy life from thee

I have ground the axe myself
do you but strike the blow

rise prithee rise
I thank thee for it and heaven forbid
that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid
fit counsellor and servant for a prince
who by thy wisdom mak'st a prince thy servant
what wouldst thou have me do

to bear with patience
such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself

thou speak'st like a physician Helicanus
that minister'st a potion unto me
that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself
attend me then I went to Antioch
where as thou know'st against the face of death
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
from whence an issue I might propagate
are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects
her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder
the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest
seem'd not to strike but smooth but thou know'st this
'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss
which fear so grew in me I hither fled
under the covering of a careful night
who seem'd my good protector and being here
bethought me what was past what might succeed
I knew him tyrannous and tyrants' fears
decrease not but grow faster than the years
and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth
that I should open to the listening air
how many worthy princes' bloods were shed
to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope
to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms
and make pretence of wrong that I have done him
when all for mine if I may call t offence
must feel war's blow who spares not innocence
which love to all of which thyself art one
who now reprov'st me for it


drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks
musings into my mind with thousand doubts
how I might stop this tempest ere it came
and finding little comfort to relieve them
I thought it princely charity to grieve them

well my lord since you have given me leave to speak
freely will I speak Antiochus you fear
and justly too I think you fear the tyrant
who either by public war or private treason
will take away your life
therefore my lord go travel for a while
till that his rage and anger be forgot
or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life
your rule direct to any if to me
day serves not light more faithful than I'll be

I do not doubt thy faith

we'll mingle our bloods together in the earth
from whence we had our being and our birth

Tyre I now look from thee then and to Tarsus
intend my travel where I'll hear from thee
and by whose letters I'll dispose myself
the care I had and have of subjects' good
on thee I'll lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it
I'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath
who shuns not to break one will sure crack both
but in our orbs we'll live so round and safe
that time of both this truth shall ne'er convince
thou show'dst a subject's shine I a true prince


so this is Tyre and this the court Here must I kill King Pericles and if I do not I am sure to be hanged at home tis dangerous Well I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that being bid to ask what he would of the king desired he might know none of his secrets now do I see he had some reason for it for if a king bid a man be a villain he is bound by the indenture of his oath to be one Hush here come the lords of Tyre


further to question me of your king's departure
his seal'd commission left in trust with me
doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel

how the king gone

if further yet you will be satisfied
why as it were unlicens'd of your loves
he would depart I'll give some light unto you
being at Antioch

what from Antioch

royal Antiochus on what cause I know not
took some displeasure at him at least he judg'd so
and doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd
to show his sorrow he'd correct himself
so puts himself unto the shipman's toil
with whom each minute threatens life or death
well I perceive
I shall not be hang'd now although I would
but since he's gone the king it sure must please
he scap'd the land to perish at the sea
I'll present myself

peace to the lords of Tyre

lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome

from him I come
with message unto princely Pericles
but since my landing I have understood
your lord hath betook himself to unknown travels
my message must return from whence it came

we have no reason to desire it
commended to our master not to us
yet ere you shall depart this we desire


my Dionyza shall we rest us here
and by relating tales of others' griefs
see if twill teach us to forget our own

that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it
for who digs hills because they do aspire
throws down one mountain to cast up a higher
O my distressed lord even such our griefs are
here they're but felt and seen with mischief's eyes
but like to groves being topp'd they higher rise

O Dionyza
who wanteth food and will not say he wants it
or can conceal his hunger till he famish
our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
our woes into the air our eyes do weep
till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder
they may awake their helps to comfort them
I'll then discourse our woes felt several years
and wanting breath to speak help me with tears

I'll do my best sir

this Tarsus o'er which I have the government
a city on whom plenty held full hand
for riches strew'd herself even in the streets
whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds
and strangers ne'er beheld but wonder'd at
whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd
like one another's glass to trim them by
their tables were stor'd full to glad the sight
and not so much to feed on as delight
all poverty was scorn'd and pride so great
the name of help grew odious to repeat

O tis too true
but see what heaven can do By this our change
these mouths whom but of late earth sea and air
were all too little to content and please
although they gave their creatures in abundance
as houses are defil'd for want of use
they are now starv'd for want of exercise
those palates who not yet two summers younger
must have inventions to delight the taste
would now be glad of bread and beg for it
those mothers who to nousle up their babes
thought nought too curious are ready now
to eat those little darlings whom they lov'd
so sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife
draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life
here stands a lord and there a lady weeping
here many sink yet those which see them fall
have scarce strength left to give them burial
is not this true


O let those cities that of plenty's cup
and her prosperities so largely taste
with their superfluous riots hear these tears
the misery of Tarsus may be theirs


where's the lord governor

here
speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste
for comfort is too far for us to expect

we have descried upon our neighbouring shore
a portly sail of ships make hitherward

I thought as much
one sorrow never comes but brings an heir
that may succeed as his inberitor
taking advantage of our misery
hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power
to beat us down the which are down already
and make a conquest of unhappy me
whereas no glory's got to overcome

that's the least fear for by the semblance
of their white flags display'd they bring us peace
and come to us as favourers not as foes

thou speak'st like him s untutor'd to repeat
who makes the fairest show means most deceit
but bring they what they will and what they can
what need we fear
the ground's the lowest and we are half way there
go tell their general we attend him here
to know for what he comes and whence he comes
and what he craves



welcome is peace if he on peace consist
if wars we are unable to resist


lord governor for so we hear you are
let not our ships and number of our men
be like a beacon fir'd to amaze your eyes
we have heard your miseries as far as Tyre
and seen the desolation of your streets
nor come we to add sorrow to your tears
but to relieve them of their heavy load
and these our ships you happily may think
are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
with bloody veins expecting overthrow
are stor'd with corn to make your needy bread
and give them life whom hunger starv'd half dead

and we'll pray for you

arise I pray you rise
we do not look for reverence but for love
and harbourage for ourself our ships and men

the which when any shall not gratify
or pay you with unthankfulness in thought
be it our wives our children or ourselves
the curse of heaven and men succeed their evils
till when the which I hope shall ne'er be seen
your Grace is welcome to our town and us

which welcome we'll accept feast here awhile
until our stars that frown lend us a smile

here have you seen a mighty king
his child I wis to incest bring
a better prince and benign lord
be quiet then as men should be
till he hath pass'd necessity
I'll show you those in troubles reign
losing a mite a mountain gain
the good in conversation
to whom I give my benison
is still at Tarsus where each man
thinks all is writ he speken can
and to remember what he does
build his statue to make him glorious
but tidings to the contrary
are brought your eyes what need speak I


good Helicane hath stay'd at home
not to eat honey like a drone
from others' labours for though he strive
to killen bad keep good alive
and to fulfil his prince' desire
how Thaliard came full bent with sin
and had intent to murder him
and that in Tarsus was not best
longer for him to make his rest
he doing so put forth to seas
where when men been there's seldom ease
for now the wind begins to blow
thunder above and deeps below
make such unquiet that the ship
should house him safe is wrack'd and split
and he good prince having all lost
by waves from coast to coast is tost
all perishen of man of pelf
ne aught escapen but himself
till Fortune tir'd with doing bad
threw him ashore to give him glad
and here he comes What shall be next
pardon old Gower this longs the text

wind rain and thunder remember earthly man
is but a substance that must yield to you
and I as fits my nature do obey you
alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks
wash'd me from shore to shore and left me breath
nothing to think on but ensuing death
let it suffice the greatness of your powers
to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes
and having thrown him from your watery grave
here to have death in peace is all he'll crave


what ho Pilch

ha come and bring away the nets

what Patch-breech I say

what say you master
look how thou stirrest now come away or I'll fetch thee with a wannion

faith master I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now

alas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them when well-a-day we could scarce help ourselves

nay master said not I as much when I saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled they say they're half fish half flesh a plague on them they ne'er come but I look to be washed Master I marvel how the fishes live in the sea

why as men do a-land the great ones eat up the little ones I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale a' plays and tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at last devours them all at a mouthful Such whales have I heard on o' the land who never leave gaping till they've swallowed the whole parish church steeple bells and all

a pretty moral

but master if I had been the sexton I would have been that day in the belfry

why man

because he should have swallowed me too and when I had been in his belly I would have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should never have left till he cast bells steeple church and parish up again But if the good King Simonides were of my mind

Simonides
we would purge the land of these drones that rob the bee of her honey

how from the finny subject of the sea
these fishers tell the infirmities of men
and from their watery empire recollect
all that may men approve or men detect


peace be at your labour honest fishermen

honest good fellow what's that if it be a day fits you search out of the calendar and nobody look after it

y' may see the sea hath cast me on your coast

what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way

a man whom both the waters and the wind
in that vast tennis-court have made the ball
for them to play upon entreats you pity him

no friend cannot you beg here's them in our country of Greece gets more with begging than we can do with working

canst thou catch any fishes then

I never practised it

nay then thou wilt starve sure for here's nothing to be got now-a-days unless thou canst fish for t

what I have been I have forgot to know
but what I am want teaches me to think on
a man throng'd up with cold my veins are chill
and have no more of life than may suffice
to give my tongue that heat to ask your help
which if you shall refuse when I am dead
for that I am a man pray see me buried

die quoth-a Now gods forbid I have a gown here come put it on keep thee warm Now afore me a handsome fellow Come thou shalt go home and we'll have flesh for holidays fish for fasting-days and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks and thou shalt be welcome


hark you my friend you said you could not beg

I did but crave

but crave Then I'll turn craver too and so I shall scape whipping

why are all your beggars whipped then

O not all my friend not all for if all your beggars were whipped I would wish no better office than to be beadle But master I'll go draw up the net


how well this honest mirth becomes their labour

hark you sir do you know where ye are

not well

why I'll tell you this is called Pentapolis and our king the good Simonides
the good King Simonides do you call him

ay sir and he deserves to be so called for his peaceable reign and good government

he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government How far is his court distant from this shore

marry sir half a day's journey and I'll tell you he hath a fair daughter and to-morrow is her birthday and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love

were my fortunes equal to my desires I could wish to make one there

O sir things must be as they may and what a man cannot get he may lawfully deal for his wife's soul


help master help here's a fish hangs in the net like a poor man's right in the law twill hardly come out Ha bots on t tis come at last and tis turned to a rusty armour

an armour friends I pray you let me see it
thanks Fortune yet that after all my crosses
thou giv'st me somewhat to repair myself
and though it was mine own part of mine heritage
with this strict charge even as he left his life
'Keep it my Pericles it hath been a shield
'Twixt me and death and pointed to this brace
'For that it sav'd me keep it in like necessity
the which the gods protect thee from t may defend thee
it kept where I kept I so dearly lov'd it
till the rough seas that spare not any man
took it in rage though calm'd they have given t again
I thank thee for t my shipwrack now s no ill
since I have here my father's gift in s will

what mean you sir

to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth
for it was sometime target to a king
I know it by this mark He lov'd me dearly
and for his sake I wish the having of it
and that you'd guide me to your sovereign's court
where with it I may appear a gentleman
I'll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor

why wilt thou tourney for the lady

I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms

why do'e take it and the gods give thee good on t

ay but hark you my friend twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the water there are certain condolements certain vails I hope sir if you thrive you'll remember from whence you had it

believe it I will
by your furtherance I am cloth'd in steel
and spite of all the rapture of the sea
this jewel holds his biding on my arm
unto thy value will I mount myself
upon a courser whose delightful steps
shall make the gazer joy to see him tread
only my friend I yet am unprovided
of a pair of bases
we'll sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair and I'll bring thee to the court myself

then honour be but a goal to my will This day I'll rise or else add ill to ill

are the knights ready to begin the triumph

they are my liege
and stay your coming to present themselves

return them we are ready and our daughter
in honour of whose birth these triumphs are
sits here like beauty's child whom nature gat
for men to see and seeing wonder at


it pleaseth you my royal father to express
my commendations great whose merit's less

'Tis fit it should be so for princes are
as jewels lose their glory if neglected
so princes their renowns if not respected
'Tis now your honour daughter to explain
the labour of each knight in his device

which to preserve mine honour I'll perform


who is the first that doth prefer himself

a knight of Sparta my renowned father
and the device he bears upon his shield
is a black Ethiop reaching at the sun
the word Lux tua vita mihi

he loves you well that holds his life of you

who is the second that presents himself

and the device he bears upon his shield
is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady
the motto thus in Spanish Piu por dulzura que por fuerza


and what's the third

the third of Antioch
and his device a wreath of chivalry
the word Me pomp provexit apex


what is the fourth

a burning torch that's turned upside down
the word Quod me alit me extinguit

which shows that beauty hath his power and will
which can as well inflame as it can kill

the fifth a hand environed with clouds
holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried
the motto thus Sic spectanda fides


and what s
the sixth and last the which the knight himself
with such a graceful courtesy deliver'd

he seems to be a stranger but his present is
a wither'd branch that's only green at top
the motto In hac spe vivo

a pretty moral
from the dejected state wherein he is
he hopes by you his fortune yet may flourish

he had need mean better than his outward show
for by his rusty outside he appears
to have practis'd more the whipstock than the lance

he well may be a stranger for he comes
to an honour'd triumph strangely furnished

and on set purpose let his armour rust
until this day to scour it in the dust

opinion's but a fool that makes us scan
the outward habit by the inward man
but stay the knights are coming we'll withdraw
into the gallery


knights
to say you're welcome were superfluous
to place upon the volume of your deeds
as in a title-page your worth in arms
since every worth in show commends itself
prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast
you are princes and my guests

but you my knight and guest
to whom this wreath of victory I give
and crown you king of this day's happiness

'Tis more by fortune lady than by merit

call it by what you will the day is yours
and here I hope is none that envies it
in framing an artist art hath thus decreed
to make some good but others to exceed
and you're her labour'd scholar Come queen o' the feast
for daughter so you are here take your place
marshal the rest as they deserve their grace

we are honour'd much by good Simonides
your presence glads our days honour we love
for who hates honour hates the gods above

sir yonder is your place

some other is more fit

contend not sir for we are gentlemen
that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
envy the great nor do the low despise

you are right courteous knights

sit sir sit

by Jove I wonder that is king of thoughts
these cates resist me she but thought upon

by Juno that is queen of marriage
wishing him my meat Sure he's a gallant gentleman

he's but a country gentleman
he has done no more than other knights have done
he has broken a staff or so so let it pass

to me he seems like diamond to glass

yon king's to me like to my father's picture
which tells me in that glory once he was
had princes sit like stars about his throne
and he the sun for them to reverence
none that beheld him but like lesser lights
did vail their crowns to his supremacy
where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night
the which hath fire in darkness none in light
whereby I see that Time's the king of men
he's both their parent and he is their grave
and gives them what he will not what they crave
what are you merry knights

who can be other in this royal presence

here with a cup that's stor'd unto the brim
as you do love fill to your mistress' lips
we drink this health to you

we thank your Grace

yet pause awhile
yon knight doth sit too melancholy
as if the entertainment in our court
had not a show might countervail his worth
note it not you Thaisa

what is it
to me my father

princes in this should live like gods above
who freely give to every one that comes
to honour them
and princes not doing so are like to gnats
which make a sound but kill'd are wonder'd at
therefore to make his entrance more sweet
here say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him

alas my father it befits not me
unto a stranger knight to be so bold
he may my proffer take for an offence
since men take women's gifts for impudence

how
do as I bid you or you'll move me else

now by the gods he could not please me better

and further tell him we desire to know of him

the king my father sir has drunk to you

I thank him

wishing it so much blood unto your life

I thank both him and you and pledge him freely

and further he desires to know of you
of whence you are your name and parentage

a gentleman of Tyre my name Pericles
my education been in arts and arms
who looking for adventures in the world
was by the rough seas reft of ships and men
and after shipwrack driven upon this shore

he thanks your Grace names himself Pericles
who only by misfortune of the seas
bereft of ships and men cast on this shore

now by the gods I pity his misfortune
and will awake him from his melancholy
come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles
and waste the time which looks for other revels
even in your armours as you are address'd
will very well become a soldier's dance
I will not have excuse with saying this
loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads
since they love men in arms as well as beds

so this was well ask'd twas so well perform'd
come sir
here is a lady that wants breathing too
and I have often heard you knights of Tyre
are excellent in making ladies trip
and that their measures are as excellent
in those that practise them they are my lord

O that's as much as you would be denied
of your fair courtesy

unclasp unclasp
thanks gentlemen to all all have done well


but you the best Pages and lights to conduct
these knights unto their several lodgings Yours sir
we have given order to be next our own

I am at your Grace's pleasure

princes it is too late to talk of love
and that's the mark I know you level at
therefore each one betake him to his rest
to-morrow all for speeding do their best

no Escanes know this of me
Antiochus from incest liv'd not free
for which the most high gods not minding longer
to withhold the vengeance that they had in store
due to this heinous capital offence
even in the height and pride of all his glory
when he was seated in a chariot
of an inestimable value and his daughter with him
a fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
their bodies even to loathing for they so stunk
that all those eyes ador'd them ere their fall
scorn now their hand should give them burial

'Twas very strange

and yet but just for though
this king were great his greatness was no guard
to bar heaven's shaft but sin had his reward
'Tis very true


see not a man in private conference
or council has respect with him but he

it shall no longer grieve without reproof

and curs'd be he that will not second it

follow me then Lord Helicane a word

with me and welcome Happy day my lords

know that our griefs are risen to the top
and now at length they overflow their banks

your griefs for what wrong not the prince you love

but if the prince do live let us salute him
or know what ground's made happy by his breath
if in the world he live we'll seek him out
if in his grave he rest we'll find him there
and be resolv'd he lives to govern us
or dead give s cause to mourn his funeral
and leaves us to our free election

whose death's indeed the strongest in our censure
and knowing this kingdom is without a head
like goodly buildings left without a roof
soon fall to ruin your noble self
that best know'st how to rule and how to reign
we thus submit unto our sovereign

live noble Helicane

for honour's cause forbear your suffrages
if that you love Prince Pericles forbear
where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease
a twelvemonth longer let me entreat you
to forbear the absence of your king
if in which time expir'd he not return
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke
but if I cannot win you to this love
go search like nobles like noble subjects
and in your search spend your adventurous worth
whom if you find and win unto return
you shall like diamonds sit about his crown

to wisdom he's a fool that will not yield
and since Lord Helicane enjoineth us
we with our travels will endeavour it

then you love us we you and we'll clasp hands
when peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands



knights from my daughter this I let you know
that for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
a married life
her reason to herself is only known
which yet from her by no means can I get

may we not get access to her my lord

faith by no means she hath so strictly tied
her to her chamber that tis impossible
one twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery
this by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd
and on her virgin honour will not break it

though loath to bid farewell we take our leaves


so
she tells me here she'll wed the stranger knight
or never more to view nor day nor light
'Tis well mistress your choice agrees with mine
I like that well how absolute she's in t
not minding whether I dislike or no
well I do commend her choice
and will no longer have it be delay'd
soft here he comes I must dissemble it


all fortune to the good Simonides

to you as much sir I am beholding to you
for your sweet music this last night I do
protest my ears were never better fed
with such delightful pleasing harmony

it is your Grace's pleasure to commend
not my desert
sir you are music's master

the worst of all her scholars my good lord

let me ask you one thing
what do you think of my daughter sir

a most virtuous princess

and she is fair too is she not

as a fair day in summer wondrous fair

my daughter sir thinks very well of you
ay so well that you must be her master
and she will be your scholar therefore look to it

I am unworthy for her schoolmaster


what's here
a letter that she loves the knight of Tyre
'Tis the king's subtilty to have my life
O seek not to entrap me gracious lord
a stranger and distressed gentleman
that never aim'd so high to love your daughter
but bent all offices to honour her

thou hast bewitch'd my daughter and thou art
a villain

by the gods I have not
never did thought of mine levy offence
nor never did my actions yet commence
a deed might gain her love or your displeasure

traitor thou liest


ay traitor

even in his throat unless it be the king
that calls me traitor I return the lie

now by the gods I do applaud his courage

my actions are as noble as my thoughts
that never relish'd of a base descent
I came unto your court for honour's cause
and not to be a rebel to her state
and he that otherwise accounts of me
this sword shall prove he's honour's enemy

no
here comes my daughter she can witness it


resolve your angry father if my tongue
did e'er solicit or my hand subscribe
to any syllable that made love to you

why sir say if you had
who takes offence at that would make me glad

yea mistress are you so peremptory


I am glad on t with all my heart
I'll tame you I'll bring you in subjection
will you not having my consent
bestow your love and your affections
upon a stranger

who for aught I know
may be nor can I think the contrary
as great in blood as I myself

therefore hear you mistress either frame
your will to mine and you sir hear you
either be rul'd by me or I will make you
man and wife
nay come your hands and lips must seal it too
and being join'd I'll thus your hopes destroy
and for a further grief God give you joy
what are you both pleas'd

yes if you love me sir

even as my life or blood that fosters it

what are you both agreed

yes if t please your majesty

yes if t please your majesty
it pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed
then with what haste you can get you to bed

now sleep yslaked hath the rout
no din but snores the house about
made louder by the o'er-fed breast
of this most pompous marriage-feast
the cat with eyne of burning coal
now couches fore the mouse's hole
and crickets sing at the oven's mouth
e'er the blither for their drouth
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed
where by the loss of maidenhead
a babe is moulded Be attent
and time that is so briefly spent
with your fine fancies quaintly eche
what's dumb in show I'll plain with speech


of Pericles the careful search
by the four opposing coigns
which the world together joins
is made with all due diligence
that horse and sail and high expense
can stead the quest At last from Tyre
fame answering the most strange inquire
to the court of King Simonides
are letters brought the tenour these
Antiochus and his daughter dead
the men of Tyrus on the head
of Helicanus would set on
the crown of Tyre but he will none
the mutiny he there hastes t' oppress
says to em if King Pericles
come not home in twice six moons
he obedient to their dooms
will take the crown The sum of this
brought hither to Pentapolis
and every one with claps can sound
'Our heir-apparent is a king
who dream'd who thought of such a thing
brief he must hence depart to Tyre
his queen with child makes her desire
which who shall cross along to go
omit we all their dole and woe
Lychorida her nurse she takes
and so to sea Their vessel shakes
on Neptune's billow half the flood
hath their keel cut but Fortune's mood
varies again the grisled north
disgorges such a tempest forth
that as a duck for life that dives
so up and down the poor ship drives
the lady shrieks and well-a-near
does fall in travail with her fear
and what ensues in this fell storm
shall for itself itself perform
conveniently the rest convey
which might not what by me is told
in your imagination hold
this stage the ship upon whose deck
the sea-tost Pericles appears to speak

thou God of this great vast rebuke these surges
which wash both heaven and hell and thou that hast
upon the winds command bind them in brass
having call'd them from the deep O still
thy deafening dreadful thunders gently quench
thy nimble sulphurous flashes O how Lychorida
how does my queen Thou stormest venomously
wilt thou spit all thyself The seaman's whistle
is as a whisper in the ears of death
unheard Lychorida Lucina O
divinest patroness and midwife gentle
to those that cry by night convey thy deity
aboard our dancing boat make swift the pangs

now Lychorida

here is a thing too young for such a place
who if it had conceit would die as I
am like to do take in your arms this piece
of your dead queen

how how Lychorida

patience good sir do not assist the storm
here's all that is left living of your queen
a little daughter for the sake of it
be manly and take comfort

O you gods
why do you make us love your goodly gifts
and snatch them straight away We here below
recall not what we give and therein may

patience good sir
even for this charge

now mild may be thy life
for a more blust'rous birth had never babe
quiet and gentle thy conditions
for thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
that e'er was prince's child Happy what follows
thou hast as chiding a nativity
as fire air water earth and heaven can make
to herald thee from the womb even at the first
thy loss is more than can thy portage quit
with all thou canst find here Now the good gods
throw their best eyes upon t


what courage sir God save you

it hath done to me the worst Yet for the love
of this poor infant this fresh-new sea-farer
I would it would be quiet

slack the bolins there thou wilt not wilt thou Blow and split thyself

but sea-room an the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon I care not

sir you queen must overboard the sea works high the wind is loud and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead

that's your superstition

pardon us sir with us at sea it hath been still observed and we are strong in custom Therefore briefly yield her for she must overboard straight

as you think meet Most wretched queen

here she lies sir

a terrible child-bed hast thou had my dear
forgot thee utterly nor have I time
to give thee hallow'd to thy grave but straight
must cast thee scarcely coffin'd in the ooze
where for a monument upon thy bones
and aye-remaining lamps the belching whale
and humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse
lying with simple shells O Lychorida
bid Nestor bring me spices ink and paper
my casket and my jewels and bid Nicander
bring me the satin coffer lay the babe
upon the pillow Hie thee whiles I say
a priestly farewell to her suddenly woman


sir we have a chest beneath the hatches caulk'd and bitumed ready

I thank thee Mariner say what coast is this

we are near Tarsus
thither gentle mariner
alter thy course for Tyre When canst thou reach it

by break of day if the wind cease

O make for Tarsus
there will I visit Cleon for the babe
cannot hold out to Tyrus there I'll leave it
at careful nursing Go thy ways good mariner
I'll bring the body presently


philemon ho


doth my lord call

get fire and meat for these poor men
'T has been a turbulent and stormy night
I have been in many but such a night as this
till now I ne'er endur'd

your master will be dead ere you return
there's nothing can be minister'd to nature
that can recover him

give this to the pothecary
and tell me how it works

good morrow sir

good morrow to your lordship

gentlemen
why do you stir so early

sir
our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea
the very principals did seem to rend
and all to topple Pure surprise and fear
made me to quit the house

that is the cause we trouble you so early
'Tis not our husbandry

O you say well

but I much marvel that your lordship having
rich tire about you should at these early hours
shake off the golden slumber of repose
'Tis most strange
nature should be so conversant with pain
being thereto not compell'd

I hold it ever
virtue and cunning were endowments greater
than nobleness and riches careless heirs
but immortality attends the former
making a man a god Tis known I ever
have studied physic through which secret art
by turning o'er authorities I have
together with my practice made familiar
to me and to my aid the blest infusions
that dwell in vegetives in metals stones
and can speak of the disturbances
that nature works and of her cures which doth give me
a more content in course of true delight
than to be thirsty after tottering honour
or tie my treasure up in silken bags
to please the fool and death

your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
your charity and hundreds call themselves
your creatures who by you have been restor'd
and not your knowledge your personal pain but even
your purse still open hath built Lord Cerimon


so lift there

what is that

sir even now
did the sea toss upon our shore this chest
'Tis of some wrack

set it down let's look upon t

'Tis like a coffin sir

whate'er it be
'Tis wondrous heavy Wrench it open straight
if the sea's stomach be o'ercharg'd with gold
'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us


how close tis caulk'd and bitumed
did the sea cast it up

I never saw so huge a billow sir
as toss'd it upon shore

come wrench it open
soft it smells most sweetly in my sense

a delicate odour

as ever hit my nostril So up with it
O you most potent gods what's here a corse

most strange

shrouded in cloth of state balm'd and entreasur'd
with full bags of spices A passport too

here I give to understand
if e'er this coffin drive a-land
I King Pericles have lost
this queen worth all our mundane cost
who finds her give her burying
she was the daughter of a king
besides this treasure for a fee
the gods requite his charity

if thou liv'st Pericles thou hast a heart
that even cracks for woe This chanc'd to-night

most likely sir

nay certainly to-night
for look how fresh she looks They were too rough
that threw her in the sea Make fire within
fetch hither all the boxes in my closet
death may usurp on nature many hours
and yet the fire of life kindle again
the overpress'd spirits I heard
of an Egyptian that had nine hours lien dead
who was by good appliances recovered


well said well said the fire and cloths
the rough and woeful music that we have
cause it to sound beseech you
the viol once more how thou stirr'st thou block
the music there I pray you give her air
gentlemen
this queen will live nature awakes a warmth
breathes out of her she hath not been entranc'd
above five hours See how she gins to blow

into life's flower again

through you increase our wonder and set up
your fame for ever

she is alive behold
her eyelids cases to those heavenly jewels
which Pericles hath lost
begin to part their fringes of bright gold
the diamonds of a most praised water
do appear to make the world twice rich Live
and make us weep to hear your fate fair creature
rare as you seem to be


O dear Diana
where am I Where's my lord What world is this

is not this strange

most rare
hush gentle neighbours
lend me your hands to the next chamber bear her
get linen now this matter must be look'd to
for her relapse is mortal Come come
and sculapius guide us


most honour'd Cleon I must needs be gone
my twelve months are expir'd and Tyrus stands
in a litigious peace You and your lady
take from my heart all thankfulness the gods
make up the rest upon you

your shafts of fortune though they hurt you mortally
yet glance full wanderingly on us

O your sweet queen
that the strict fates had pleas'd you had brought her hither
to have bless'd mine eyes with her
we cannot but obey
the powers above us Could I rage and roar
as doth the sea she lies in yet the end
must be as tis My gentle babe Marina whom
for she was born at sea I have nam'd so here
I charge your charity withal and leave her
the infant of your care beseeching you
to give her princely training that she may be
manner'd as she is born

fear not my lord but think
your Grace that fed my country with your corn
for which the people's prayers still fall upon you
must in your child be thought on If neglection
should therein make me vile the common body
by you reliev'd would force me to my duty
but if to that my nature need a spur
the gods revenge it upon me and mine
to the end of generation
I believe you
your honour and your goodness teach me to t
without your vows Till she be married madam
by bright Diana whom we honour all
unscissar'd shall this hair of mine remain
though I show ill in t So I take my leave
good madam make me blessed in your care
in bringing up my child

I have one myself
who shall not be more dear to my respect
than yours my lord

madam my thanks and prayers

we'll bring your Grace e'en to the edge o' the shore
then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
the gentlest winds of heaven

your offer Come dearest madam O no tears
Lychorida no tears
look to your little mistress on whose grace
you may depend hereafter Come my lord


madam this letter and some certain jewels
lay with you in your coffer which are now
at your command Know you the character

it is my lord's
that I was shipp'd at sea I well remember
even on my eaning time but whether there
deliver'd by the holy gods
I cannot rightly say But since King Pericles
my wedded lord I ne'er shall see again
a vestal livery will I take me to
and never more have joy

Diana's temple is not distant far
where you may abide till your date expire
moreover if you please a niece of mine
shall there attend you

my recompense is thanks that's all
yet my good will is great though the gift small

imagine Pericles arriv'd at Tyre
welcom'd and settled to his own desire
his woeful queen we leave at Ephesus
unto Diana there a votaress
now to Marina bend your mind
whom our fast-growing scene must find
at Tarsus and by Cleon train'd
in music letters who hath gain'd
of education all the grace
which makes her bath the heart and places
of general wonder But alack
of earned praise Marina's life
seeks to take off by treason's knife
and in this kind hath our Cleon
one daughter and a wench full grown
even ripe for marriage-rite this maid
hight Philoten and it is said
for certain in our story she
would ever with Marina be
be t when she weav'd the sleided silk
with fingers long small white as milk
or when she would with sharp neeld wound
the cambric which she made more sound
by hurting it when to the lute
she sung and made the night-bird mute
that still records with moan or when
she would with rich and constant pen
vail to her mistress Dian still
this Philoten contends in skill
with absolute Marina so
vie feathers white Marina gets
all praises which are paid as debts
and not as given This so darks
in Philoten all graceful marks
that Cleon's wife with envy rare
a present murderer does prepare
for good Marina that her daughter
might stand peerless by this slaughter
the sooner her vile thoughts to stead
Lychorida our nurse is dead
and cursed Dionyza hath
the pregnant instrument of wrath
prest for this blow The unborn event
I do commend to your content
only I carry winged time
post on the lame feet of my rime
which never could I so convey
unless your thoughts went on my way
Dionyza doth appear


thy oath remember thou hast sworn to do t
'Tis but a blow which never shall be known
thou canst not do a thing i' the world so soon
to yield thee so much profit Let not conscience
which is but cold inflaming love i' thy bosom
inflame too nicely nor let pity which
even women have cast off melt thee but he
a soldier to thy purpose

I'll do t but yet she is a goodly creature

the fitter then the gods should have her Here
she comes weeping for her only mistress' death
thou art resolv'd

I am resolv'd

no I will rob Tellus of her weed
to strew thy green with flowers the yellows blues
the purple violets and marigolds
shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave
while summer days do last Ay me poor maid
born in a tempest when my mother died
this world to me is like a lasting storm
whirring me from my friends

how now Marina why do you keep alone
how chance my daughter is not with you Do not
consume your blood with sorrowing you have
a nurse of me Lord how your favour's chang'd
with this unprofitable woe Come
give me your flowers ere the sea mar it
walk with Leonine the air is quick there
and it pierces and sharpens the stomach Come
Leonine take her by the arm walk with her

I'll not bereave you of your servant

come come
I love the king your father and yourself
with more than foreign heart We every day
expect him here when he shall come and find
our paragon to all reports thus blasted
he will repent the breadth of his great voyage
blame both my lord and me that we have taken
no care to your best courses Go I pray you
walk and be cheerful once again reserve
that excellent complexion which did steal
the eyes of young and old Care not for me
I can go home alone

well I will go
but yet I have no desire to it

come come I know tis good for you
remember what I have said

I warrant you madam

I'll leave you my sweet lady for a while
pray you walk softly do not heat your blood
what I must have care of you

my thanks sweet madam

is this wind westerly that blows

south-west

when I was born the wind was north

was t so

my father as nurse said did never fear
his kingly hands haling ropes
and clasping to the mast endur'd a sea
that almost burst the deck

when was this

when I was born
never were waves nor wind more violent
and from the ladder-tackle washes off
a canvas-climber Ha says one wilt out
and with a dropping industry they skip
from stem to stern the boatswain whistles and
the master calls and trebles their confusion

come say your prayers

what mean you

if you require a little space for prayer
for the gods are quick of ear and I am sworn
to do my work with haste

why will you kill me

to satisfy my lady

why would she have me kill'd
now as I can remember by my troth
I never did her hurt in all my life
I never spake bad word nor did ill turn
to any living creature believe me la
I never kill'd a mouse nor hurt a fly
I trod upon a worm against my will
but I wept for it How have I offended
wherein my death might yield her any profit
or my life imply her any danger

my commission

you will not do t for all the world I hope
you are well favour'd and your looks foreshow
you have a gentle heart I saw you lately
when you caught hurt in parting two that fought
good sooth it show'd well in you do so now
your lady seeks my life come you between
and save poor me the weaker

I am sworn
and will dispatch


hold villain


a prize a prize

half-part mates half-part

these roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes
and they have seiz'd Marina Let her go
there's no hope she'll return I'll swear she's dead
and thrown into the sea But I'll see further
perhaps they will but please themselves upon her
not carry her aboard If she remain
whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain


Boult

sir

search the market narrowly Mitylene is full of gallants we lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless

we were never so much out of creatures We have but poor three and they can do no more than they can do and they with continual action are even as good as rotten

therefore let's have fresh ones whate'er we pay for them If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade we shall never prosper
thou sayst true tis not the bringing up of poor bastards as I think I have brought up some eleven

ay to eleven and brought them down again But shall I search the market

what else man The stuff we have a strong wind will blow it to pieces they are so pitifully sodden

thou sayst true they're too unwholesome o' conscience The poor Transylvanian is dead that lay with the little baggage

ay she quickly pooped him she made him roast-meat for worms But I'll go search the market


three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly and so give over

why to give over I pray you is it a shame to get when we are old

O our credit comes not in like the commodity nor the commodity wages not with the danger therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate twere not amiss to keep our door hatched Besides the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over

come other sorts offend as well as we



come your ways My masters you say she's a virgin

O sir we doubt it not

master I have gone through for this piece you see if you like her so if not I have lost my earnest

Boult has she any qualities

she has a good face speaks well and has excellent good clothes there's no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused

what's her price Boult

I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces

well follow me my masters you shall have your money presently Wife take her in instruct her what she has to do that she may not be raw in her entertainment



performance shall follow


alack that Leonine was so slack so slow
he should have struck not spoke or that these pirates
not enough barbarous had not o'erboard thrown me
for to seek my mother

why lament you pretty one

that I am pretty

come the gods have done their part in you

I accuse them not

you are lit into my hands where you are like to live

to scape his hands where I was like to die

ay and you shall live in pleasure

no

yes indeed shall you and taste gentlemen of all fashions You shall fare well you shall have the difference of all complexions What do you stop your ears

are you a woman

what would you have me be an I be not a woman

an honest woman or not a woman

marry whip thee gosling I think I shall have something to do with you Come you are a young foolish sapling and must be bowed as I would have you

the gods defend me

if it please the gods to defend you by men then men must comfort you men must feed you men must stir you up Boult's returned
now sir hast thou cried her through the market

I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs I have drawn her picture with my voice

and I prithee tell me how dost thou find the inclination of the people especially of the younger sort

faith they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their father's testament There was a Spaniard's mouth so watered that he went to bed to her very description

we shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on

to-night to-night But mistress do you know the French knight that cowers i' the hams

who Monsieur Veroles

ay he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation but he made a groan at it and swore he would see her to-morrow

well well as for him he brought his disease hither here he does but repair it I know he will come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the sun

well if we had of every nation a traveller we should lodge them with this sign
pray you come hither awhile You have fortunes coming upon you Mark me you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly to despise profit where you have most gain To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion and that opinion a mere profit

I understand you not

O take her home mistress take her home these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice

thou sayst true i' faith so they must for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant

faith some do and some do not But mistress if I have bargained for the joint

thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit

I may so

who should deny it Come young one I like the manner of your garments well

ay by my faith they shall not be changed yet

Boult spend thou that in the town report what a sojourner we have you'll lose nothing by custom When nature framed this piece she meant thee a good turn therefore say what a paragon she is and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report
I warrant you mistress thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined I'll bring home some to-night

come your ways follow me

if fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep
untied I still my virgin knot will keep
Diana aid my purpose

what have we to do with Diana
pray you will you go with us


why are you foolish Can it be undone

O Dionyza such a piece of slaughter
the sun and moon ne'er look'd upon

I think
you'll turn a child again
were I chief lord of all this spacious world
I'd give it to undo the deed O lady
much less in blood than virtue yet a princess
to equal any single crown o' the earth
i' the justice of compare O villain Leonine
whom thou hast poison'd too
if thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness
becoming well thy fact what canst thou say
when noble Pericles shall demand his child

that she is dead Nurses are not the fates
to foster it nor ever to preserve
she died at night I'll say so Who can cross it
unless you play the pious innocent
and for an honest attribute cry out
'She died by foul play

O go to Well well
of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods

be one of those that think
the pretty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence
and open this to Pericles I do shame
to think of what a noble strain you are
and of how coward a spirit

to such proceeding
who ever but his approbation added
though not his prime consent he did not flow
from honourable sources

be it so then
yet none does know but you how she came dead
nor none can know Leonine being gone
she did distain my child and stood between
her and her fortunes none would look on her
but cast their gazes on Marina's face
whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
and though you call my course unnatural
you not your child well loving yet I find
it greets me as an enterprise of kindness
perform'd to your sole daughter

heavens forgive it

and as for Pericles
what should he say We wept after her hearse
and even yet we mourn her monument
is almost finish'd and her epitaphs
in glittering golden characters express
a general praise to her and care in us
at whose expense tis done

thou art like the harpy
which to betray dost with thine angel's face
seize with thine eagle's talons

doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies
but yet I know you'll do as I advise

thus time we waste and longest leagues make short
sail seas in cockles have an wish but for t
making to take your imagination
from bourn to bourn region to region
by you being pardon'd we commit no crime
to use one language in each several clime
where our scenes seem to live I do beseech you
to learn of me who stand i' the gaps to teach you
the stages of our story Pericles
is now again thwarting the wayward seas
attended on by many a lord and knight
to see his daughter all his life's delight
old Helicanus goes along Behind
is left to govern it you bear in mind
old Escanes whom Helicanus late
advanc'd in time to great and high estate
this king to Tarsus think his pilot thought
so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on
to fetch his daughter home who first is gone
like motes and shadows see them move awhile
your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile


see how belief may suffer by foul show
this borrow'd passion stands for true old woe
and Pericles in sorrow all devour'd
with sighs shot through and biggest tears o'ershower'd
leaves Tarsus and again embarks He swears
never to wash his face nor cut his hairs
he puts on sackcloth and to sea He bears
a tempest which his mortal vessel tears
and yet he rides it out Now please you wit
the epitaph is for Marina writ
by wicked Dionyza

the fairest sweet'st and best lies here
who wither'd in her spring of year
she was of tyrus the king's daughter
on whom foul death hath made this slaughter
marina was she call'd and at her birth
thetis being proud swallow'd some part o' the earth
therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflow'd
hath thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd
wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint
make raging battery upon shores of flint

no visor does become black villany
so well as soft and tender flattery
let Pericles believe his daughter's dead
and bear his courses to be ordered
by Lady Fortune while our scene must play
his daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
in her unholy service Patience then
and think you now are all in Mitylen

did you ever hear the like

no nor never shall do in such a place as this she being once gone

but to have divinity preached there did you ever dream of such a thing

no no Come I am for no more bawdy-houses Shall's go hear the vestals sing

I'll do any thing now that is virtuous but I am out of the road of rutting for ever


well I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne'er come here

fie fie upon her she is able to freeze the god Priapus and undo a whole generation we must either get her ravished or be rid of her When she should do for clients her fitment and do me the kindness of our profession she has me her quirks her reasons her master-reasons her prayers her knees that she would make a puritan of the devil if he should cheapen a kiss of her

faith I must ravish her or she'll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers and make all our swearers priests

now the pox upon her green-sickness for me
faith there's no way to be rid on t but by the way to the pox Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised

we should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers


how now How a dozen of virginities

now the gods to-bless your honour

I am glad to see your honour in good health

you may so tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs How now wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal withal and defy the surgeon

we have here one sir if she would but there never came her like in Mitylene

if she'd do the deed of darkness thou wouldst say

your honour knows what tis to say well enough


for flesh and blood sir white and red you shall see a rose and she were a rose indeed if she had but

what prithee

O sir I can be modest

that dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste


here comes that which grows to the stalk never plucked yet I can assure you

is she not a fair creature

faith she would serve after a long voyage at sea Well there's for you leave us

I beseech your honour give me leave a word and I'll have done presently

I beseech you do
first I would have you note this is an honourable man

I desire to find him so that I may worthily note him

next he's the governor of this country and a man whom I am bound to

if he govern the country you are bound to him indeed but how honourable he is in that I know not

pray you without any more virginal fencing will you use him kindly He will line your apron with gold

what he will do graciously I will thankfully receive

ha' you done

my lord she's not paced yet you must take some pains to work her to your manage Come we will leave his honour and her together

go thy ways

now pretty one how long have you been at this trade
what trade sir

why I cannot name t but I shall offend

I cannot be offended with my trade Please you to name it

how long have you been of this profession

e'er since I can remember

did you go to t so young Were you a gamester at five or at seven

earlier too sir if now I be one

why the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale

do you know this house to be a place of such resort and will come into t I hear say you are of honourable parts and are the governor of this place

why hath your principal made known unto you who I am
who is my principal

why your herb-woman she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity O you have heard something of my power and so stand aloof for more serious wooing But I protest to thee pretty one my authority shall not see thee or else look friendly upon thee Come bring me to some private place come come

if you were born to honour show it now
if put upon you make the judgment good
that thought you worthy of it

how's this how's this Some more be sage

for me
that am a maid though most ungentle fortune
hath plac'd me in this sty where since I came
diseases have been sold dearer than physic
O that the gods
would set me free from this unhallow'd place
though they did change me to the meanest bird
that flies i' the purer air

thou couldst have spoke so well ne'er dream'd thou couldst
had I brought hither a corrupted mind
thy speech had alter'd it Hold here's gold for thee
persever in that clear way thou goest
and the gods strengthen thee

the good gods preserve you

for me be you thoughten
that I came with no ill intent for to me
the very doors and windows savour vilely
farewell Thou art a piece of virtue and
I doubt not but thy training hath been noble
hold here's more gold for thee
a curse upon him die he like a thief
that robs thee of thy goodness If thou dost
hear from me it shall be for thy good



avaunt thou damned door-keeper Your house
but for this virgin that doth prop it would
sink and overwhelm you Away


how's this We must take another course with you If your peevish chastity which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope shall undo a whole household let me be gelded like a spaniel Come your ways

whither would you have me

I must have your maidenhead taken off or the common hangman shall execute it Come your ways We'll have no more gentlemen driven away Come your ways I say


how now what's the matter

worse and worse mistress she has here spoken holy words to the Lord Lysimachus

O abominable


marry hang her up for ever

the nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman and she sent him away as cold as a snowball saying his prayers too

Boult take her away use her at thy pleasure crack the glass of her virginity and make the rest malleable

an if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is she shall be ploughed

hark hark you gods

she conjures away with her Would she had never come within my doors Marry hang you She's born to undo us Will you not go the way of women-kind Marry come up my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays


come mistress come your ways with me

whither wilt thou have me

to take from you the jewel you hold so dear
prithee tell me one thing first

come now your one thing

what canst thou wish thine enemy to be

why I could wish him to be my master or rather my mistress

neither of these are so bad as thou art
since they do better thee in their command
thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend
of hell would not in reputation change
thou art the damned door-keeper to every
coystril that comes inquiring for his Tib
to the choleric fisting of every rogue
thy ear is liable thy food is such
as hath been belch'd on by infected lungs

what would you have me do go to the wars would you where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one
do any thing but this thou doest Empty
old receptacles or common sewers of filth
serve by indenture to the common hangman
any of these ways are yet better than this
for what thou professest a baboon could he speak
would own a name too dear O that the gods
would safely deliver me from this place
here here's gold for thee
if that thy master would gain by me
proclaim that I can sing weave sew and dance
with other virtues which I'll keep from boast
and I will undertake all these to teach
I doubt not but this populous city will
yield many scholars

but can you teach all this you speak of

prove that I cannot take me home again
and prostitute me to the basest groom

well I will see what I can do for thee if I can place thee I will

but amongst honest women

faith my acquaintance lies little amongst them But since my master and mistress have bought you there's no going but by their consent therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough Come I'll do for thee what I can come your ways


Marina thus the brothel scapes and chances
into an honest house our story says
she sings like one immortal and she dances
as goddess-like to her admired lays
deep clerks she dumbs and with her neeld composes
nature's own shape of bud bird branch or berry
that even her art sisters the natural roses
her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry
that pupils lacks she none of noble race
who pour their bounty on her and her gain
she gives the cursed bawd Here we her place
where we left him on the sea We there him lost
whence driven before the winds he is arriv'd
here where his daughter dwells and on this coast
suppose him now at anchor The city striv'd
God Neptune's annual feast to keep from whence
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies
his banners sable trimm'd with rich expense
and to him in his barge with fervour hies
in your supposing once more put your sight
of heavy Pericles think this his bark
where what is done in action more if might
shall be discover'd please you sit and hark

where's the Lord Helicanus he can resolve you
O here he is
sir there's a barge put off from Mitylene
and in it is Lysimachus the governor
who craves to come aboard What is your will


ho gentlemen my lord calls


doth your lordship call

gentlemen there's some of worth would come aboard
I pray ye greet them fairly

sir
this is the man that can in aught you would
resolve you

hail reverend sir The gods preserve you

and you sir to outlive the age I am
and die as I would do

you wish me well
seeing this goodly vessel ride before us
I made to it to know of whence you are

first what is your place

I am the governor of this place you lie before

sir
our vessel is of Tyre in it the king
a man who for this three months hath not spoken
to any one nor taken sustenance
but to prorogue his grief

upon what ground is his distemperature

'Twould be too tedious to repeat
but the main grief springs from the loss
of a beloved daughter and a wife


you may
but bootless is your sight he will not speak
to any

yet let me obtain my wish

behold him

this was a goodly person
till the disaster that one mortal night
drove him to this

sir king all hail the gods preserve you
hall royal sir

it is in vain he will not speak to you

sir
would win some words of him

'Tis well bethought
she questionless with her sweet harmony
and other chosen attractions would allure
and make a battery through his deafen'd ports
which now are midway stopp'd
she is all happy as the fair'st of all
and with her fellow maids is now upon
the leafy shelter that abuts against
the island's side


sure all's effectless yet nothing we'll omit
that bears recovery's name But since your kindness
we have stretch'd thus far let us beseech you
that for our gold we may provision have
wherein we are not destitute for want
but weary for the staleness
O sir a courtesy
which if we should deny the most just gods
for every graff would send a caterpillar
and so afflict our province Yet once more
let me entreat to know at large the cause
of your king's sorrow

sit sir I will recount it to you
but see I am prevented


O here is
the lady that I sent for Welcome fair one
is't not a goodly presence

she's a gallant lady

she's such a one that were I well assur'd
came of a gentle kind and noble stock
fair one all goodness that consists in bounty
expect even here where is a kingly patient
if that thy prosperous and artificial feat
can draw him but to answer thee in aught
thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
as thy desires can wish

sir I will use
my utmost skill in his recovery
provided
that none but I and my companion maid
be suffer'd to come near him

come let us leave her
and the gods make her prosperous


mark'd he your music


see she will speak to him

hail sir my lord lend ear

hum ha

I am a maid
my lord that ne'er before invited eyes
but have been gaz'd on like a comet she speaks
my lord that may be hath endur'd a grief
might equal yours if both were justly weigh'd
though wayward Fortune did malign my state
my derivation was from ancestors
who stood equivalent with mighty kings
but time hath rooted out my parentage
and to the world and awkward casualties
bound me in servitude

but there is something glows upon my cheek
and whispers in mine ear Go not till he speak

my fortunes parentage good parentage
to equal mine was it not thus what say you

I said my lord if you did know my parentage
you would not do me violence

I do think so Pray you turn your eyes upon me
you are like something that What country-woman
here of these shores

no nor of any shores
yet I was mortally brought forth and am
no other than I appear

I am great with woe and shall deliver weeping
my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one
her stature to an inch as wand-like straight
as silver-voic'd her eyes as jewel-like
and cas'd as richly in pace another Juno
who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry
the more she gives them speech Where do you live

where I am but a stranger from the deck
you may discern the place

where were you bred
and how achiev'd you these endowments which
you make more rich to owe

should I tell my history it would seem
like lies disdain'd in the reporting

prithee speak
falseness cannot come from thee for thou look'st
modest as justice and thou seem'st a palace
and make my senses credit thy relation
to points that seem impossible for thou lookest
like one I lov'd indeed What were thy friends
didst thou not say when I did push thee back
which was when I perceiv'd thee that thou cam'st
from good descending

so indeed I did

report thy parentage I think thou saidst
thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury
and that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine
if both were open'd

some such thing
I said and said no more but what my thoughts
did warrant me was likely

tell thy story
of my endurance thou art a man and I
have suffer'd like a girl yet thou dost look
like Patience gazing on kings' graves and smiling
extremity out of act What were thy friends
how lost thou them Thy name my most kind virgin
recount I do beseech thee Come sit by me

my name is Marina

O I am mock'd
and thou by some incensed god sent hither
to make the world to laugh at me

patience good sir
or here I'll cease

nay I'll be patient
thou little know'st how thou dost startle me
to call thyself Marina
the name
was given me by one that had some power
my father and a king

how a king's daughter
and call'd Marina

you said you would believe me
but not to be a troubler of your peace
I will end here

but are you flesh and blood
have you a working pulse and are no fairy
motion Well speak on Where were you born
and wherefore call'd Marina

call'd Marina
for I was born at sea


my mother was the daughter of a king
who died the minute I was born
as my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
deliver'd weeping

O stop there a little
this is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
did mock sad fools withal this cannot be
my daughter's buried Well where were you bred
I'll hear you more to the bottom of your story
and never interrupt you

you'll scorn to believe me twere best I did give o'er

I will believe you by the syllable
of what you shall deliver Yet give me leave
how came you in these parts where were you bred

till cruel Cleon with his wicked wife
did seek to murder me and having woo'd
a villain to attempt it who having drawn to do t
a crew of pirates came and rescu'd me
brought me to Mitylene But good sir
whither will you have me Why do you weep It may be
you think me an impostor no good faith
I am the daughter to King Pericles
if good King Pericles be

ho Helicanus

calls my lord

thou art a grave and noble counsellor
most wise in general tell me if thou canst
what this maid is or what is like to be
that thus hath made me weep

here is the regent sir of Mitylene
speaks nobly of her

she never would tell
her parentage being demanded that
she would sit still and weep

O Helicanus strike me honour'd sir
give me a gash put me to present pain
lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
o'erbear the shores of my mortality
and drown me with their sweetness O come hither
thou that begett'st him that did thee beget
thou that wast born at sea buried at Tarsus
and found at sea again O Helicanus
down on thy knees thank the holy gods as loud
as thunder threatens us this is Marina
what was thy mother's name tell me but that
for truth can never be confirm'd enough

first sir I pray
what is your title

I am Pericles of Tyre but tell me now
my drown'd queen's name as in the rest you said
thou hast been god-like perfect
thou'rt heir of kingdoms and another life
to Pericles thy father

is it no more to be your daughter than
to say my mother's name was Thaisa
Thaisa was my mother who did end
the minute I began

now blessing on thee rise thou art my child
give me fresh garments Mine own Helicanus
she is not dead at Tarsus as she should have been
by savage Cleon she shall tell thee all
she is thy very princess Who is this

sir tis the governor of Mitylene
who hearing of your melancholy state
did come to see you

I embrace you
give me my robes I am wild in my beholding
O heavens bless my girl But hark what music
tell Helicanus my Marina tell him
o'er point by point for yet he seems to doubt
how sure you are my daughter But what music

my lord I hear none

none
the music of the spheres List my Marina

it is not good to cross him give him way
rarest sounds Do ye not hear

my lord I hear


most heavenly music
it nips me unto list'ning and thick slumber
hangs upon mine eyes let me rest


a pillow for his head
so leave him all Well my companion friends
if this but answer to my just belief
I'll well remember you

my temple stands in Ephesus hie thee thither
and do upon mine altar sacrifice
there when my maiden priests are met together
before the people all
to mourn thy crosses with thy daughter's call
and give them repetition to the life
perform my bidding or thou liv'st in woe
do it and happy by my silver bow
awake and tell thy dream


celestial Dian goddess argentine
I will obey thee Helicanus


sir

my purpose was for Tarsus there to strike
the inhospitable Cleon but I am
for other service first toward Ephesus
turn our blown sails eftsoons I'll tell thee why


and give you gold for such provision
as our intents will need

sir
with all my heart and when you come ashore
I have another suit

you shall prevail
were it to woo my daughter for it seems
you have been noble towards her

sir lend me your arm

come my Marina


now our sands are almost run
more a little and then dumb
this my last boon give me
that you aptly will suppose
what pageantry what feats what shows
what minstrelsy and pretty din
the regent made in Mitylen
to greet the king So he thriv'd
that he is promis'd to be wiv'd
to fair Marina but in no wise
till he had done his sacrifice
as Dian bade whereto being bound
the interim pray you all confound
in feather'd briefness sails are fill'd
and wishes fall out as they're will'd
at Ephesus the temple see
our king and all his company
that he can hither come so soon
is by your fancy's thankful doom

hail Dian to perform thy just command
I here confess myself the King of Tyre
at Pentapolis the fair Thaisa
at sea in childbed died she but brought forth
a maid-child call'd Marina who O goddess
wears yet thy silver livery She at Tarsus
was nurs'd with Cleon whom at fourteen years
he sought to murder but her better stars
brought her to Mitylene gainst whose shore
riding her fortunes brought the maid aboard us
where by her own most clear remembrance she
made known herself my daughter

voice and favour
you are you are O royal Pericles


what means the nun she dies help gentlemen

noble sir
if you have told Diana's altar true

reverend appearer no
I threw her o'erboard with these very arms

upon this coast I warrant you

'Tis most certain

look to the lady O she's but o'erjoy'd
early in blustering morn this lady was
thrown upon this shore I op'd the coffin
found there rich jewels recover'd her and plac'd her
here in Diana's temple

may we see them

great sir they shall be brought you to my house
whither I invite you Look Thaisa is
recovered
O let me look
if he be none of mine my sanctity
will to my sense bend no licentious ear
but curb it spite of seeing O my lord
are you not Pericles Like him you speak
like him you are Did you not name a tempest
a birth and death

the voice of dead Thaisa

that Thaisa am I supposed dead
and drown'd

immortal Dian

now I know you better
when we with tears parted Pentapolis
the king my father gave you such a ring

this this no more you gods your present kindness
makes my past miseries sport you shall do well
that on the touching of her lips I may
melt and no more be seen O come be buried
a second time within these arms

my heart
leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom


look who kneels here Flesh of thy flesh Thaisa
thy burden at the sea and call'd Marina
for she was yielded there

bless'd and mine own

hail madam and my queen

I know you not
you have heard me say when I did fly from Tyre
I left behind an ancient substitute
can you remember what I call'd the man
I have nam'd him oft

'Twas Helicanus then

still confirmation
embrace him dear Thaisa this is he
now do I long to hear how you were found
how possibly preserv'd and whom to thank
besides the gods for this great miracle

lord Cerimon my lord this man
through whom the gods have shown their power that can
from first to last resolve you

reverend sir
the gods can have no mortal officer
how this dead queen re-lives

I will my lord
beseech you first go with me to my house
where shall be shown you all was found with her
how she came placed here in the temple
no needful thing omitted

pure Dian bless thee for thy vision I
will offer night-oblations to thee Thaisa
this prince the fair-betrothed of your daughter
shall marry her at Pentapolis And now
this ornament
makes me look dismal will I clip to form
and what this fourteen years no rasor touch'd
to grace thy marriage-day I'll beautify

lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit sir
my father's dead
heavens make a star of him Yet there my queen
we'll celebrate their nuptials and ourselves
will in that kingdom spend our following days
our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign
lord Cerimon we do our longing stay
to hear the rest untold Sir lead's the way

in Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
of monstrous lust the due and just reward
in Pericles his queen and daughter seen
although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen
virtue preserv'd from fell destruction's blast
led on by heaven and crown'd with joy at last
in Helicanus may you well descry
a figure of truth of faith of loyalty
in reverend Cerimon there well appears
the worth that learned charity aye wears
for wicked Cleon and his wife when fame
had spread their cursed deed and honour'd name
that him and his they in his palace burn
the gods for murder seemed so content
to punish them although not done but meant
so on your patience evermore attending
new joy wait on you Here our play hath ending

THE COMEDY OF ERRORS

proceed Solinus to procure my fall
and by the doom of death end woes and all

merchant of Syracusa plead no more
I am not partial to infringe our laws
the enmity and discord which of late
sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
to merchants our well-dealing countrymen
who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods
excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
it hath in solemn synods been decreed
both by the Syracusians and ourselves
t' admit no traffic to our adverse towns
nay more if any born at Ephesus
be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs
again if any Syracusian born
come to the bay of Ephesus he dies
his goods confiscate to the duke's dispose
unless a thousand marks be levied
to quit the penalty and to ransom him
thy substance valu'd at the highest rate
cannot amount unto a hundred marks
therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die

yet this my comfort when your words are done
my woes end likewise with the evening sun

well Syracusian say in brief the cause
and for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus

a heavier task could not have been impos'd
than I to speak my griefs unspeakable
yet that the world may witness that my end
was wrought by nature not by vile offence
I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave
in Syracusa was I born and wed
unto a woman happy but for me
and by me too had not our hap been bad
with her I liv'd in joy our wealth increas'd
by prosperous voyages I often made
to Epidamnum till my factor's death
and the great care of goods at random left
drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
from whom my absence was not six months old
before herself almost at fainting under
the pleasing punishment that women bear
had made provision for her following me
there had she not been long but she became
a joyful mother of two goodly sons
and which was strange the one so like the other
as could not be distinguish'd but by names
that very hour and in the self-same inn
a meaner woman was delivered
of such a burden male twins both alike
those for their parents were exceeding poor
I bought and brought up to attend my sons
my wife not meanly proud of two such boys
made daily motions for our home return
unwilling I agreed alas too soon
we came aboard
a league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
before the always-wind-obeying deep
gave any tragic instance of our harm
but longer did we not retain much hope
for what obscured light the heavens did grant
did but convey unto our fearful minds
which though myself would gladly have embrac'd
yet the incessant weepings of my wife
weeping before for what she saw must come
and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
that mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear
forc'd me to seek delays for them and me
and this it was for other means was none
the sailors sought for safety by our boat
and left the ship then sinking-ripe to us
my wife more careful for the latter-born
had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast
such as seafaring men provide for storms
to him one of the other twins was bound
whilst I had been like heedful of the other
the children thus dispos'd my wife and I
fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd
fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast
and floating straight obedient to the stream
were carried towards Corinth as we thought
dispers'd those vapours that offended us
and by the benefit of his wished light
the seas wax'd calm and we discovered
two ships from far making amain to us
of Corinth that of Epidaurus this
but ere they came O let me say no more
gather the sequel by that went before

nay forward old man do not break off so
for we may pity though not pardon thee

O had the gods done so I had not now
worthily term'd them merciless to us
for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
we were encounter'd by a mighty rock
which being violently borne upon
our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
so that in this unjust divorce of us
fortune had left to both of us alike
her part poor soul seeming as burdened
with lesser weight but not with lesser woe
was carried with more speed before the wind
and in our sight they three were taken up
by fishermen of Corinth as we thought
at length another ship had seiz'd on us
and knowing whom it was their hap to save
gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack'd guests
and would have reft the fishers of their prey
had not their bark been very slow of sail
and therefore homeward did they bend their course
thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss
that by misfortune was my life prolong'd
to tell sad stories of my own mishaps

and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
do me the favour to dilate at full
what hath befall'n of them and thee till now

at eighteen years became inquisitive
after his brother and importun'd me
that his attendant for his case was like
reft of his brother but retain'd his name
might bear him company in the quest of him
whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see
I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd
five summers have I spent in furthest Greece
roaming clean through the bounds of Asia
and coasting homeward came to Ephesus
hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
or that or any place that harbours men
but here must end the story of my life
and happy were I in my timely death
could all my travels warrant me they live

hapless geon whom the fates have mark'd
to bear the extremity of dire mishap
now trust me were it not against our laws
which princes would they may not disannul
my soul should sue as advocate for thee
but though thou art adjudged to the death
and passed sentence may not be recall'd
but to our honour's great disparagement
yet will I favour thee in what I can
therefore merchant I'll limit thee this day
to seek thy life by beneficial help
try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus
beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
and live if no then thou art doom'd to die
gaoler take him to thy custody

I will my lord

hopeless and helpless doth geon wend
but to procrastinate his lifeless end


lest that your goods too soon be confiscate
this very day a Syracusian merchant
is apprehended for arrival here
and not being able to buy out his life
according to the statute of the town
dies ere the weary sun set in the west
there is your money that I had to keep

go bear it to the Centaur where we host
and stay there Dromio till I come to thee
within this hour it will be dinner-time
till that I'll view the manners of the town
peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings
and then return and sleep within mine inn
for with long travel I am stiff and weary
get thee away

many a man would take you at your word
and go indeed having so good a mean

a trusty villain sir that very oft
when I am dull with care and melancholy
lightens my humour with his merry jests
what will you walk with me about the town
and then go to my inn and dine with me

I am invited sir to certain merchants
of whom I hope to make much benefit
I crave your pardon Soon at five o'clock
please you I'll meet with you upon the mart
and afterward consort you till bed-time
my present business calls me from you now

farewell till then I will go lose myself
and wander up and down to view the city

sir I commend you to your own content

he that commends me to mine own content
commends me to the thing I cannot get
I to the world am like a drop of water
that in the ocean seeks another drop
who falling there to find his fellow forth
unseen inquisitive confounds himself
so I to find a mother and a brother
in quest of them unhappy lose myself


here comes the almanack of my true date

what now How chance thou art return'd so soon

return'd so soon rather approach'd too late
the capon burns the pig falls from the spit
the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell
my mistress made it one upon my cheek
she is so hot because the meat is cold
you come not home because you have no stomach
you have no stomach having broke your fast
but we that know what tis to fast and pray
are penitent for your default to-day

stop in your wind sir tell me this I pray
where have you left the money that I gave you

O sixpence that I had o' Wednesday last
to pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper
the saddler had it sir I kept it not

I am not in a sportive humour now
tell me and dally not where is the money
we being strangers here how dar'st thou trust
so great a charge from thine own custody

I pray you jest sir as you sit at dinner
I from my mistress come to you in post
for she will score your fault upon my pate
methinks your maw like mine should be your clock
and strike you home without a messenger

come Dromio come these jests are out of season
reserve them till a merrier hour than this
where is the gold I gave in charge to thee

to me sir why you gave no gold to me

come on sir knave have done your foolishness
and tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge

my charge was but to fetch you from the mart
home to your house the Ph nix sir to dinner
my mistress and her sister stays for you

now as I am a Christian answer me
in what safe place you have bestow'd my money
that stands on tricks when I am undispos'd
where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me

I have some marks of yours upon my pate
some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders
but not a thousand marks between you both
if I should pay your worship those again
perchance you will not bear them patiently

thy mistress' marks what mistress slave hast thou

your worship's wife my mistress at the Ph nix
she that doth fast till you come home to dinner
and prays that you will hie you home to dinner

what wilt thou flout me thus unto my face
being forbid There take you that sir knave


nay an you will not sir I'll take my heels


upon my life by some device or other
the villain is o'er-raught of all my money
they say this town is full of cozenage
as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye
dark-working sorcerers that change the mind
soul-killing witches that deform the body
disguised cheaters prating mountebanks
and many such-like liberties of sin
if it prove so I will be gone the sooner
I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave
I greatly fear my money is not safe

neither my husband nor the slave return'd
that in such haste I sent to seek his master
sure Luciana it is two o'clock

and from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner
good sister let us dine and never fret
a man is master of his liberty
time is their master and when they see time
they'll go or come if so be patient sister

why should their liberty than ours be more

because their business still lies out o' door

look when I serve him so he takes it ill

O know he is the bridle of your will

there's none but asses will be bridled so

why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe
there's nothing situate under heaven's eye
but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
are their males' subjects and at their controls
men more divine the masters of all these
lords of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas
indu'd with intellectual sense and souls
of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls
are masters to their females and their lords
then let your will attend on their accords

this servitude makes you to keep unwed

not this but troubles of the marriage-bed

but were you wedded you would bear some sway

ere I learn love I'll practise to obey

how if your husband start some other where

till he come home again I would forbear
patience unmov'd no marvel though she pause
they can be meek that have no other cause
a wretched soul bruis'd with adversity
we bid be quiet when we hear it cry
but were we burden'd with like weight of pain
as much or more we should ourselves complain
so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me
but if thou live to see like right bereft
this fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left

well I will marry one day but to try
here comes your man now is your husband nigh


say is your tardy master now at hand

nay he's at two hands with me and that my two ears can witness


ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
beshrew his hand I scarce could understand it

spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning

nay he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them

but say I prithee is he coming home
it seems he hath great care to please his wife

why mistress sure my master is horn-mad

horn-mad thou villain

I mean not cuckold-mad but sure he is stark mad
when I desir'd him to come home to dinner
he ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold
''Tis dinner time quoth I my gold quoth he
'Will you come home quoth I my gold quoth he
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee villain
'The pig quoth I is burn'd my gold quoth he
'My mistress sir quoth I hang up thy mistress
I know not thy mistress out on thy mistress

quoth who

quoth my master
'I know quoth he no house no wife no mistress
so that my errand due unto my tongue
I thank him I bear home upon my shoulders
for in conclusion he did beat me there

go back again thou slave and fetch him home

go back again and be new beaten home
for God's sake send some other messenger


and he will bless that cross with other beating
between you I shall have a holy head

hence prating peasant fetch thy master home

am I so round with you as you with me
that like a football you do spurn me thus
you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
if I last in this service you must case me in leather


fie how impatience loureth in your face

his company must do his minions grace
whilst I at home starve for a merry look
hath homely age the alluring beauty took
from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
are my discourses dull barren my wit
unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
do their gay vestments his affections bait
that's not my fault he's master of my state
what ruins are in me that can be found
by him not ruin'd then is he the ground
of my defeatures My decayed fair
a sunny look of his would soon repair
but too unruly deer he breaks the pale
and feeds from home poor I am but his stale

self-harming jealousy fie beat it hence

unfeeling fools can with such wrengs dispense
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere
or else what lets it but he would be here
sister you know he promis'd me a chain
would that alone alone he would detain
so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
I see the jewel best enamelled
that others touch yet often touching will
wear gold and no man that hath a name
by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
since that my beauty cannot please his eye
I'll weep what's left away and weeping die

how many fond fools serve mad jealousy


the gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave
is wander'd forth in care to seek me out
by computation and mine host's report
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart See here he comes


how now sir is your merry humour alter'd
as you love strokes so jest with me again
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
my house was at the Ph nix Wast thou mad

that thus so madly thou didst answer me

what answer sir when spake I such a word

even now even here not half-an-hour since

I did not see you since you sent me hence
home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me

villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt
and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner
for which I hope thou felt'st I was displeas'd

I am glad to see you in this merry vein
what means this jest I pray you master tell me

think'st thou I jest Hold take thou that and that


hold sir for God's sake now your jest is earnest
upon what bargain do you give it me

because that I familiarly sometimes
do use you for my fool and chat with you
your sauciness will jest upon my love
and make a common of my serious hours
when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
but creep in crannies when he hides his beams
if you will jest with me know my aspect
and fashion your demeanour to my looks
or I will beat this method in your sconce

sconce call you it so you would leave battering I had rather have it a head an you use these blows long I must get a sconce for my head and insconce it too or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders But I pray sir why am I beaten

dost thou not know
nothing sir but that I am beaten

shall I tell you why

ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a wherefore

why first for flouting me and then wherefore
for urging it the second time to me

was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
when in the why and the wherefore is neither rime nor reason
well sir I thank you

thank me sir for what

marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing

I'll make you amends next to give you nothing for something But say sir is it dinner-time


in good time sir what's that

basting

well sir then twill be dry

if it be sir I pray you eat none of it

your reason

lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting

well sir learn to jest in good time there's a time for all things

I durst have denied that before you were so choleric

by what rule sir


let's hear it

there's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature

may he not do it by fine and recovery

yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man

why is Time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement

because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit

why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit

not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair

why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit


for what reason

for two and sound ones too

nay not sound I pray you

sure ones then

nay not sure in a thing falsing

certain ones then

name them

the one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge

you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things


but your reason was not substantial why there is not time to recover

thus I mend it Time himself is bald and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers

I knew twould be a bald conclusion
but soft who wafts us yonder


ay ay Antipholus look strange and frown
some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
I am not Adriana nor thy wife
the time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
that never words were music to thine ear
that never object pleasing in thine eye
that never touch well welcome to thy hand
that never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste
unless I spake or look'd or touch'd or carv'd to thee
how comes it now my husband O how comes it
thyself I call it being strange to me
that undividable incorporate
am better than thy dear self's better part
Ah do not tear away thyself from me
for know my love as easy mayst thou fall
a drop of water in the breaking gulf
and take unmingled thence that drop again
without addition or diminishing
as take from me thyself and not me too
how dearly would it touch thee to the quick
shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
and that this body consecrate to thee
by ruffian lust should be contaminate
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
and hurl the name of husband in my face
and tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
and from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
and break it with a deep-divorcing vow
I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
my blood is mingled with the crime of lust
for if we two be one and thou play false
I do digest the poison of thy flesh
being strumpeted by thy contagion
keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed
I live unstain'd thou undishonoured

plead you to me fair dame I know you not
in Ephesus I am but two hours old
as strange unto your town as to your talk
who every word by all my wit being scann'd
want wit in all one word to understand

fie brother how the world is chang'd with you
when were you wont to use my sister thus
she sent for you by Dromio home to dinner

by Dromio


by thee and this thou didst return from him
that he did buffet thee and in his blows
denied my house for his me for his wife

did you converse sir with this gentle-woman
what is the course and drift of your compact

I sir I never saw her till this time

villain thou liest for even her very words
didst thou deliver to me on the mart

I never spake with her in all my life

how can she thus then call us by our names
unless it be by inspiration

how ill agrees it with your gravity
a betting him to thwart me in my mood
be it my wrong you are from me exempt
but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
come I will fasten on this sleeve of thine
thou art an elm my husband I a vine
whose weakness married to thy stronger state
makes me with thy strength to communicate
if aught possess thee from me it is dross
usurping ivy brier or idle moss
who all for want of pruning with intrusion
infect thy sap and live on thy confusion

to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
what was I married to her in my dream
or sleep I now and think I hear all this
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
until I know this sure uncertainty
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy


O for my beads I cross me for a sinner
this is the fairy land O spite of spites
we talk with goblins owls and elvish sprites
if we obey them not this will ensue
they'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue

why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not
Dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot

I am transformed master am not I

I think thou art in mind and so am I

nay master both in mind and in my shape

thou hast thine own form

no I am an ape
if thou art chang'd to aught tis to an ass

'Tis true she rides me and I long for grass
'Tis so I am an ass else it could never be
but I should know her as well as she knows me

come come no longer will I be a fool
to put the finger in the eye and weep
whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn
come sir to dinner Dromio keep the gate
husband I'll dine above with you to-day
and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
sirrah if any ask you for your master
say he dines forth and let no creature enter
come sister Dromio play the porter well

am I in earth in heaven or in hell
sleeping or waking mad or well-advis'd
known unto these and to myself disguis'd
and in this mist at all adventures go

master shall I be porter at the gate

ay and let none enter lest I break your pate

come come Antipholus we dine too late

good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all
my wife is shrewish when I keep not hours
say that I linger'd with you at your shop
to see the making of her carkanet
and that to-morrow you will bring it home
but here's a villain that would face me down
he met me on the mart and that I beat him
and charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold
and that I did deny my wife and house
thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this

that you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show
if the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink
your own handwriting would tell you what I think

I think thou art an ass

marry so it doth appear
by the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear
I should kick being kick'd and being at that pass
you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass

you are sad Signior Balthazar pray God our cheer
may answer my good will and your good welcome here

I hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear

O Signior Balthazar either at flesh or fish
a table-full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish


and welcome more common for that's nothing but words

small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast

ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest
but though my cates be mean take them in good part
better cheer may you have but not with better heart
but soft my door is lock'd Go bid them let us in

maud Bridget Marian Cicely Gillian Ginn

mome malt-horse capon coxcomb idiot patch
either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch
dost thou conjure for wenches that thou call'st for such store
when one is one too many Go get thee from the door

what patch is made our porter My master stays in the street


who talks within there ho open the door

right sir I'll tell you when an you'll tell me wherefore

wherefore for my dinner I have not din'd to-day

nor to-day here you must not come again when you may

what art thou that keep'st me out from the house I owe

the porter for this time sir and my name is Dromio

O villain thou hast stolen both mine office and my name
the one ne'er got me credit the other mickle blame
if thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place
thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name or thy name for an ass

what a coil is there Dromio who are those at the gate
let my master in Luce

faith no he comes too late
and so tell your master

O Lord I must laugh
have at you with a proverb Shall I set in my staff

have at you with another that's when can you tell

if thy name be call'd Luce Luce thou hast answer'd him well

do you hear you minion you'll let us in I trow

I thought to have ask'd you

and you said no

so come help well struck there was blow for blow
thou baggage let me in

can you tell for whose sake

master knock the door hard

let him knock till it ache

you'll cry for this minion if I beat the door down

what needs all that and a pair of stocks in the town

who is that at the door that keeps all this noise

by my troth your town is troubled with unruly boys

are you there wife you might have come before

your wife sir knave go get you from the door
if you went in pain master this knave' would go sore

here is neither cheer sir nor welcome we would fain have either

in debating which was best we shall part with neither

they stand at the door master bid them welcome hither

there is something in the wind that we cannot get in

you would say so master if your garments were thin
your cake here is warm within you stand here in the cold
it would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold

go fetch me something I'll break ope the gate

break any breaking here and I'll break your knave's pate

a man may break a word with you sir and words are but wind

it seems thou wantest breaking out upon thee hind

here's too much out upon thee I pray thee let me in

ay when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin

well I'll break in Go borrow me a crow

a crow without feather Master mean you so
for a fish without a fin there's a fowl without a feather
if a crow help us in sirrah we'll pluck a crow together

go get thee gone fetch me an iron crow

have patience sir O let it not be so
herein you war against your reputation
and draw within the compass of suspect
the unviolated honour of your wife
her sober virtue years and modesty
plead on her part some cause to you unknown
and doubt not sir but she will well excuse
why at this time the doors are made against you
be rul'd by me depart in patience
and let us to the Tiger all to dinner
and about evening come yourself alone
to know the reason of this strange restraint
if by strong hand you offer to break in
now in the stirring passage of the day
a vulgar comment will be made of it
and that supposed by the common rout
against your yet ungalled estimation
that may with foul intrusion enter in
and dwell upon your grave when you are dead
for slander lives upon succession
for ever housed where it gets possession

you have prevail'd I will depart in quiet
I know a wench of excellent discourse
pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle
there will we dine this woman that I mean
my wife but I protest without desert
hath oftentimes upbraided me withal
to her will we to dinner

get you home
and fetch the chain by this I know tis made
bring it I pray you to the Porpentine
for there's the house that chain will I bestow
be it for nothing but to spite my wife
upon mine hostess there Good sir make haste
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me
I'll knock elsewhere to see if they'll disdain me

I'll meet you at that place some hour hence

do so This jest shall cost me some expense

and may it be that you have quite forgot A husband's office Shall Antipholus
even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot
shall love in building grow so ruinous
if you did wed my sister for her wealth
then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness
or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
muffle your false love with some show of blindness
let not my sister read it in your eye
be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator
look sweet speak fair become disloyalty
apparel vice like virtue's harbinger
bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
be secret-false what need she be acquainted
what simple thief brags of his own attaint
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
and let her read it in thy looks at board
shame hath a bastard fame well managed
alas poor women make us but believe
being compact of credit that you love us
though others have the arm show us the sleeve
we in your motion turn and you may move us
then gentle brother get you in again
comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife

sweet mistress what your name is else I know not
nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
than our earth's wonder more than earth divine
teach me dear creature how to think and speak
lay open to my earthy-gross conceit
smother'd in errors feeble shallow weak
the folded meaning of your words' deceit
against my soul's pure truth why labour you
to make it wander in an unknown field
transform me then and to your power I'll yield
but if that I am I then well I know
your weeping sister is no wife of mine
nor to her bed no homage do I owe
far more far more to you do I decline
O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
to drown me in thy sister flood of tears
sing siren for thyself and I will dote
spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs
and as a bed I'll take them and there lie
and in that glorious supposition think
he gains by death that hath such means to die
let Love being light be drowned if she sink

what are you mad that you do reason so

not mad but mated how I do not know

it is a fault that springeth from your eye
for gazing on your beams fair sun being by

gaze where you should and that will clear your sight

as good to wink sweet love as look on night

why call you me love call my sister so

thy sister's sister

that's my sister

no
it is thyself mine own self's better part
mine eye's clear eye my dear heart's dearer heart
my food my fortune and my sweet hope's aim
my sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim

all this my sister is or else should be
call thyself sister sweet for I aim thee
thee will I love and with thee lead my life
thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife
give me thy hand

O soft sir hold you still
I'll fetch my sister to get her good will

why how now Dromio where run'st thou so fast

do you know me sir am I Dromio am I your man am I myself

thou art Dromio thou art my man thou art thyself

I am an ass I am a woman's man and besides myself

what woman's man and how besides thyself

marry sir besides myself I am due to a woman one that claims me one that haunts me one that will have me
what claim lays she to thee

marry sir such claim as you would lay to your horse and she would have me as a beast not that I being a beast she would have me but that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to me

what is she

a very reverent body aye such a one as a man may not speak of without he say Sir-reverence I have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage

how dost thou mean a fat marriage

marry sir she's the kitchen-wench and all grease and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter if she lives till doomsday she'll burn a week longer than the whole world

what complexion is she of

swart like my shoe but her face nothing like so clean kept for why she sweats a man may go over shoes in the grime of it

that's a fault that water will mend

no sir tis in grain Noah's flood could not do it
what's her name

Nell sir but her name and three quarters that is an ell and three quarters will not measure her from hip to hip

then she bears some breadth

no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip she is spherical like a globe I could find out countries in her

in what part of her body stands Ireland

marry sir in her buttocks I found it out by the bogs

where Scotland

I found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand

where France

in her forehead armed and reverted making war against her heir
where England

I looked for the chalky cliffs but I could find no whiteness in them but I guess it stood in her chin by the salt rheum that ran between France and it

where Spain

faith I saw not but I felt it hot in her breath

where America the Indies

O sir upon her nose all o'er embellished with rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose

where stood Belgia the Netherlands

O sir I did not look so low To conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me call'd me Dromio swore I was assured to her told me what privy marks I had about me as the mark of my shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that I amazed ran from her as a witch
and I think if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel
she had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' the wheel

go hie thee presently post to the road
I will not harbour in this town to-night
if any bark put forth come to the mart
where I will walk till thou return to me
if every one knows us and we know none
'Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone

as from a bear a man would run for life
so fly I from her that would be my wife


there's none but witches do inhabit here
and therefore tis high time that I were hence
she that doth call me husband even my soul
doth for a wife abhor but her fair sister
possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace
of such enchanting presence and discourse
hath almost made me traitor to myself
but lest myself be guilty to self-wrong
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song

master Antipholus

ay that's my name

I know it well sir lo here is the chain
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine
the chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long

what is your will that I shall do with this

what please yourself sir I have made it for you

made it for me sir I bespoke it not

not once nor twice but twenty times you have
go home with it and please your wife withal
and soon at supper-time I'll visit you
and then receive my money for the chain
I pray you sir receive the money now
for fear you ne'er see chain nor money more

you are a merry man sir fare you well


what I should think of this I cannot tell
but this I think there's no man is so vain
that would refuse so fair an offer'd chain
I see a man here needs not live by shifts
when in the streets he meets such golden gifts
I'll to the mart and there for Dromio stay
if any ship put out then straight away

you know since Pentecost the sum is due
and since I have not much importun'd you
nor now I had not but that I am bound
to Persia and want guilders for my voyage
therefore make present satisfaction

even just the sum that I do owe to you
is growing to me by Antipholus
and in the instant that I met with you
he had of me a chain at five o'clock
I shall receive the money for the same
pleaseth you walk with me down to his house
I will discharge my bond and thank you too


that labour may you save see where he comes

while I go to the goldsmith's house go thou
and buy a rope's end that I will bestow
among my wife and her confederates
for locking me out of my doors by day
but soft I see the goldsmith Get thee gone
buy thou a rope and bring it home to me



a man is well holp up that trusts to you
I promised your presence and the chain
but neither chain nor goldsmith came to me
belike you thought our love would last too long
if it were chain'd together and therefore came not

saving your merry humour here's the note
how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat
the fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion
which doth amount to three odd ducats more
than I stand debted to this gentleman
I pray you see him presently discharg'd
for he is bound to sea and stays but for it

I am not furnish'd with the present money
besides I have some business in the town
good signior take the stranger to my house
disburse the sum on the receipt thereof
perchance I will be there as soon as you

then you will bring the chain to her yourself

no bear it with you lest I come not time enough

well sir I will Have you the chain about you

an if I have not sir I hope you have
or else you may return without your money

nay come I pray you sir give me the chain
both wind and tide stays for this gentleman
and I to blame have held him here too long

good Lord you use this dalliance to excuse
your breach of promise to the Porpentine
I should have child you for not bringing it

the hour steals on I pray you sir dispatch

you hear how he importunes me the chain

why give it to my wife and fetch your money

come come you know I gave it you even now
either send the chain or send by me some token

fie now you run this humour out of breath
come where's the chain I pray you let me see it

my business cannot brook this dalliance
good sir say whe'r you'll answer me or no
if not I'll leave him to the officer

I answer you what should I answer you


I owe you none till I receive the chain

you know I gave it you half an hour since

you gave me none you wrong me much to say so

you wrong me more sir in denying it
consider how it stands upon my credit

well officer arrest him at my suit

I do
and charge you in the duke's name to obey me

this touches me in reputation
either consent to pay this sum for me
or I attach you by this officer

arrest me foolish fellow if thou dar'st

here is thy fee arrest him officer
I would not spare my brother in this case
if he should scorn me so apparently

I do arrest you sir you hear the suit

I do obey thee till I give thee bail
but sirrah you shall buy this sport as dear
as all the metal in your shop will answer

sir sir I shall have law in Ephesus
to your notorious shame I doubt it not


master there is a bark of Epidamnum
that stays but till her owner comes aboard
and then she bears away Our fraughtage sir
the oil the balsamum and aqua-vit
the ship is in her trim the merry wind
blows fair from land they stay for nought at all
but for their owner master and yourself

how now a madman Why thou peevish sheep
what ship of Epidamnum stays for me

a ship you sent me to to hire waftage

thou drunken slave I sent thee for a rope
and told thee to what purpose and what end

you sent me for a rope's end as soon
you sent me to the bay sir for a bark

I will debate this matter at more leisure
and teach your ears to list me with more heed
to Adriana villain hie thee straight
that's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
there is a purse of ducats let her send it
tell her I am arrested in the street
and that shall bail me Hie thee slave be gone
on officer to prison till it come


to Adriana that is where we din'd
where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband
she is too big I hope for me to compass
thither I must although against my will
for servants must their masters' minds fulfil


Ah Luciana did he tempt thee so
mights thou perceive austerely in his eye
that he did plead in earnest yea or no
look'd he or red or pale or sad or merrily
what observation mad'st thou in this case

first he denied you had in him no right

he meant he did me none the more my spite

then swore he that he was a stranger here

and true he swore though yet forsworn he were

then pleaded I for you

and what said he

that love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me

with what persuasion did he tempt thy love

with words that in an honest suit might move
first he did praise my beauty then my speech
didst speak him fair

have patience I beseech

I cannot nor I will not hold me still
my tongue though not my heart shall have his will
he is deformed crooked old and sere
ill-fac'd worse bodied shapeless every where
vicious ungentle foolish blunt unkind
stigmatical in making worse in mind

who would be jealous then of such a one
no evil lost is wail'd when it is gone

Ah but I think him better than I say
and yet would herein others' eyes were worse
far from her nest the lapwing cries away
my heart prays for him though my tongue do curse

here go the desk the purse sweet now make haste

how hast thou lost thy breath

by running fast

where is thy master Dromio is he well

no he's in Tartar limbo worse than hell
a devil in an everlasting garment hath him
one whose hard heart is button'd up with steel
a fiend a fairy pitiless and rough
a wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff
a back-friend a shoulder-clapper one that countermands
the passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands
a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well
one that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell

why man what is the matter
I do not know the matter he is rested on the case

what is he arrested tell me at whose suit

I know not at whose suit he is arrested well
but he's in a suit of buff which rested him that can I tell
will you send him mistress redemption the money in his desk

go fetch it sister

this I wonder at
that he unknown to me should be in debt
tell me was he arrested on a band

not on a band but on a stronger thing
a chain a chain Do you not hear it ring

what the chain

it was two ere I left him and now the clock strikes one

the hours come back that did I never hear

O yes if any hour meet a sergeant a' turns back for very fear

as if Time were in debt how fondly dost thou reason

time is a very bankrupt and owes more than he's worth to season
nay he's a thief too have you not heard men say
that Time comes stealing on by night and day
if Time be in debt and theft and a sergeant in the way
hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day


go Dromio there's the money bear it straight
and bring thy master home immediately
come sister I am press'd down with conceit Conceit my comfort and my injury

there's not a man I meet but doth salute me
as if I were their well acquainted friend
and every one doth call me by my name
some tender money to me some invite me
some other give me thanks for kindnesses
some offer me commodities to buy
even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
and show'd me silks that he had bought for me
and therewithal took measure of my body
sure these are but imaginary wiles
and Lapland sorcerers inhabit here


master here's the gold you sent me for
what have you got the picture of old Adam new apparelled

what gold is this What Adam dost thou mean

not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the Prodigal he that came behind you sir like an evil angel and bid you forsake your liberty
I understand thee not

no why tis a plain case he that went like a base-viol in a case of leather the man sir that when gentlemen are tired gives them a fob and rests them he sir that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike

what thou meanest an officer

ay sir the sergeant of the band he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band one that thinks a man always going to bed and says God give you good rest

well sir there rest in your foolery Is there any ship puts forth to-night may we be gone

why sir I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy Delay Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you

the fellow is distract and so am I
and here we wander in illusions
some blessed power deliver us from hence


well met well met Master Antipholus
I see sir you have found the goldsmith now

Satan avoid I charge thee tempt me not

master is this Mistress Satan

it is the devil

nay she is worse she is the devil's dam and here she comes in the habit of a light wench and thereof comes that the wenches say God damn me that's as much as to say God make me a light wench It is written they appear to men like angels of light light is an effect of fire and fire will burn ergo light wenches will burn Come not near her

your man and you are marvellous merry sir Will you go with me we'll mend our dinner here

master if you do expect spoon-meat so bespeak a long spoon

why Dromio

marry he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil

avoid thee fiend what tell'st thou me of supping
thou art as you are all a sorceress

give me the ring of mine you had at dinner
or for my diamond the chain you promis'd
and I'll be gone sir and not trouble you

some devils ask but the parings of one's nail
a rush a hair a drop of blood a pin
a nut a cherry-stone
but she more covetous would have a chain
master be wise an if you give it her
the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it

I pray you sir my ring or else the chain
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so

avaunt thou witch Come Dromio let us go

'Fly pride says the peacock mistress that you know

now out of doubt Antipholus is mad
else would he never so demean himself
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
and for the same he promis'd me a chain
both one and other he denies me now
the reason that I gather he is mad
besides this present instance of his rage
is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
of his own doors being shut against his entrance
belike his wife acquainted with his fits
on purpose shut the doors against his way
my way is now to hie home to his house
and tell his wife that being lunatic
he rush'd into my house and took perforce
my ring away This course I fittest choose
for forty ducats is too much to lose


fear me not man I will not break away
to warrant thee as I am rested for
my wife is in a wayward mood to-day
and will not lightly trust the messenger
that I should be attach'd in Ephesus
I tell you twill sound harshly in her ears


here comes my man I think he brings the money

how now sir have you that I sent you for

here's that I warrant you will pay them all

but where's the money

why sir I gave the money for the rope

five hundred ducats villain for a rope


to what end did I bid thee hie thee home

to a rope's end sir and to that end am I return'd

and to that end sir I will welcome you


good sir be patient

nay tis for me to be patient I am in adversity

good now hold thy tongue

nay rather persuade him to hold his hands

thou whoreson senseless villain

I would I were senseless sir that I might not feel your blows
thou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an ass

I am an ass indeed you may prove it by my long ears I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows When I am cold he heats me with beating when I am warm he cools me with beating I am waked with it when I sleep raised with it when I sit driven out of doors with it when I go from home welcomed home with it when I return nay I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat and I think when he hath lamed me I shall beg with it from door to door

come go along my wife is coming yonder


mistress respice finem respect your end or rather to prophesy like the parrot Beware the rope's end

wilt thou still talk


how say you now is not your husband mad

his incivility confirms no less
good Doctor Pinch you are a conjurer
establish him in his true sense again
and I will please you what you will demand


mark how he trembles in his ecstasy

give me your hand and let me feel your pulse

there is my hand and let it feel your ear


I charge thee Satan hous'd within this man
to yield possession to my holy prayers
and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven

peace doting wizard peace I am not mad

O that thou wert not poor distressed soul

you minion you are these your customers
did this companion with the saffron face
whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
and I denied to enter in my house

O husband God doth know you din'd at home
where would you had remain'd until this time
free from these slanders and this open shame

din'd at home Thou villain what say'st thou

sir sooth to say you did not dine at home

were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out

perdy your doors were lock'd and you shut out

and did not she herself revile me there

sans fable she herself revil'd you there


certes she did the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you

and did not I in rage depart from thence

in verity you did my bones bear witness
that since have felt the vigour of his rage

is't good to soothe him in these contraries

it is no shame the fellow finds his vein
and yielding to him humours well his frenzy

thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me

alas I sent you money to redeem you
by Dromio here who came in haste for it

money by me heart and good will you might

went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats

he came to me and I deliver'd it

and I am witness with her that she did

God and the rope-maker bear me witness
that I was sent for nothing but a rope

mistress both man and master is possess'd
I know it by their pale and deadly looks
they must be bound and laid in some dark room

say wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day
and why dost thou deny the bag of gold

I did not gentle husband lock thee forth

but I confess sir that we were lock'd out

dissembling villain thou speak'st false in both

dissembling harlot thou art false in all
and art confederate with a damned pack
to make a loathsome abject scorn of me
but with these nails I'll pluck out those false eyes
that would behold in me this shameful sport

O bind him bind him let him not come near me

more company the fiend is strong within him

ay me poor man how pale and wan he looks


what will you murder me Thou gaoler thou
I am thy prisoner wilt thou suffer them

masters let him go
he is my prisoner and you shall not have him

go bind this man for he is frantic too


what wilt thou do thou peevish officer
hast thou delight to see a wretched man
do outrage and displeasure to himself

he is my prisoner if I let him go
the debt he owes will be requir'd of me

I will discharge thee ere I go from thee
bear me forthwith unto his creditor
and knowing how the debt grows I will pay it
good Master doctor see him safe convey'd
home to my house O most unhappy day
O most unhappy strumpet

master I am here enter'd in bond for you

out on thee villain wherefore dost thou mad me

will you be bound for nothing be mad good master cry the devil

God help poor souls how idly do they talk

go bear him hence Sister go you with me

say now whose suit is he arrested at

one Angelo a goldsmith do you know him

I know the man What is the sum he owes

two hundred ducats
say how grows it due

due for a chain your husband had of him

he did bespeak a chain for me but had it not

when as your husband all in rage to-day
came to my house and took away my ring
the ring I saw upon his finger now
straight after did I meet him with a chain

it may be so but I did never see it
come gaoler bring me where the goldsmith is
I long to know the truth hereof at large


God for thy mercy they are loose again

and come with naked swords Let's call more help

away they'll kill us


I see these witches are afraid of swords

she that would be your wife now ran from you

come to the Centaur fetch our stuff from thence
I long that we were safe and sound aboard

faith stay here this night they will surely do us no harm you saw they speak us fair give us gold methinks they are such a gentle nation that but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me I could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch

I will not stay to-night for all the town
therefore away to get our stuff aboard

I am sorry sir that I have hinder'd you
but I protest he had the chain of me
though most dishonestly he doth deny it
how is the man esteem'd here in the city

of very reverend reputation sir
of credit infinite highly belov'd
second to none that lives here in the city
his word might bear my wealth at any time

speak softly yonder as I think he walks


'Tis so and that self chain about his neck
which he forswore most monstrously to have
good sir draw near to me I'll speak to him
Signior Antipholus I wonder much
that you would put me to this shame and trouble
and not without some scandal to yourself
with circumstance and oaths so to deny
this chain which now you wear so openly
beside the charge the shame imprisonment
who but for staying on our controversy
had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day
this chain you had of me can you deny it

I think I had I never did deny it

yes that you did sir and forswore it too

who heard me to deny it or forswear it

these ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee
fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou liv'st
to walk where any honest men resort

thou art a villain to impeach me thus
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
against thee presently if thou dar'st stand

I dare and do defy thee for a villain
hold hurt him not for God's sake he is mad
some get within him take his sword away
bind Dromio too and bear them to my house

run master run for God's sake take a house
this is some priory in or we are spoil'd

be quiet people Wherefore throng you hither

to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
let us come in that we may bind him fast
and bear him home for his recovery

I knew he was not in his perfect wits

I am sorry now that I did draw on him

how long hath this possession held the man

and much different from the man he was
but till this afternoon his passion
ne'er brake into extremity of rage

hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea
buried some dear friend Hath not else his eye
stray'd his affection in unlawful love
a sin prevailing much in youthful men
who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
which of these sorrows is he subject to

to none of these except it be the last
namely some love that drew him oft from home

you should for that have reprehended him

why so I did

ay but not rough enough
as roughly as my modesty would let me

haply in private

and in assemblies too

ay but not enough

it was the copy of our conference
in bed he slept not for my urging it
at board he fed not for my urging it
alone it was the subject of my theme
in company I often glanced it
still did I tell him it was vile and bad

and thereof came it that the man was mad
the venom clamours of a jealous woman
poison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth
it seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing
thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings
unquiet meals make ill digestions
thereof the raging fire of fever bred
and what's a fever but a fit of madness
thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls
sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue
but moody moping and dull melancholy
kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
and at her heels a huge infectious troop
of pale distemperatures and foes to life
in food in sport and life-preserving rest
to be disturb'd would mad or man or beast
the consequence is then thy jealous fits
have scar'd thy husband from the use of wits

she never reprehended him but mildly
when he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly
why bear you these rebukes and answer not

good people enter and lay hold on him

no not a creature enters in my house

then let your servants bring my husband forth

neither he took this place for sanctuary
and it shall privilege him from your hands
till I have brought him to his wits again
or lose my labour in assaying it

I will attend my husband be his nurse
diet his sickness for it is my office
and will have no attorney but myself
and therefore let me have him home with me

be patient for I will not let him stir
till I have us'd the approved means I have
with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath
a charitable duty of my order
therefore depart and leave him here with me

I will not hence and leave my husband here
and ill it doth beseem your holiness
to separate the husband and the wife

be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him


complain unto the duke of this indignity

come go I will fall prostrate at his feet
and never rise until my tears and prayers
have won his Grace to come in person hither
and take perforce my husband from the abbess

by this I think the dial points at five
comes this way to the melancholy vale
the place of death and sorry execution
behind the ditches of the abbey here

upon what cause

to see a reverend Syracusian merchant
who put unluckily into this bay
against the laws and statutes of this town
beheaded publicly for his offence

see where they come we will behold his death

kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey


yet once again proclaim it publicly
if any friend will pay the sum for him
he shall not die so much we tender him
justice most sacred duke against the abbess

she is a virtuous and a reverend lady
it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong

may it please your Grace Antipholus my husband
whom I made lord of me and all I had
at your important letters this ill day
a most outrageous fit of madness took him
that desperately he hurried through the street
with him his bondman all as mad as he
doing displeasure to the citizens
by rushing in their houses bearing thence
rings jewels anything his rage did like
once did I get him bound and sent him home
whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
that here and there his fury had committed
anon I wot not by what strong escape
he broke from those that had the guard of him
each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
met us again and madly bent on us
chas'd us away till raising of more aid
we came again to bind them Then they fled
into this abbey whither we pursu'd them
and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
and will not suffer us to fetch him out
nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
therefore most gracious duke with thy command
let him be brought forth and borne hence for help

long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars
and I to thee engag'd a prince's word
when thou didst make him master of thy bed
to do him all the grace and good I could
go some of you knock at the abbey gate
and bid the lady abbess come to me
I will determine this before I stir

O mistress mistress shift and save yourself
my master and his man are both broke loose
beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire
and ever as it blaz'd they threw on him
great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
my master preaches patience to him and the while
his man with scissors nicks him like a fool
and sure unless you send some present help
between them they will kill the conjurer

peace fool thy master and his man are here
and that is false thou dost report to us

mistress upon my life I tell you true
I have not breath'd almost since I did see it
he cries for you and vows if he can take you
to scotch your face and to disfigure you


come stand by me fear nothing Guard with halberds

ay me it is my husband Witness you
that he is borne about invisible
even now we hous'd him in the abbey here
and now he's here past thought of human reason


justice most gracious duke O grant me justice
even for the service that long since I did thee
when I bestrid thee in the wars and took
deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
that then I lost for thee now grant me justice

unless the fear of death doth make me dote
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio

justice sweet prince against that woman there
that hath abused and dishonour'd me
even in the strength and height of injury
beyond imagination is the wrong
that she this day hath shameless thrown on me

discover how and thou shalt find me just

this day great duke she shut the doors upon me
while she with harlots feasted in my house

a grievous fault Say woman didst thou so

no my good lord myself he and my sister
to-day did dine together So befall my soul
as this is false he burdens me withal

ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night
but she tells to your highness simple truth

in this the madman justly chargeth them

my liege I am advised what I say
neither disturb'd with the effect of wine
nor heady-rash provok'd with raging ire
albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner
that goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her
could witness it for he was with me then
who parted with me to go fetch a chain
promising to bring it to the Porpentine
where Balthazar and I did dine together
our dinner done and he not coming thither
I went to seek him in the street I met him
and in his company that gentleman
there did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
that I this day of him receiv'd the chain
which God he knows I saw not for the which
he did arrest me with an officer
for certain ducats he with none return'd
then fairly I bespoke the officer
to go in person with me to my house
by the way we met
my wife her sister and a rabble more
of vile confederates along with them
they brought one Pinch a hungry lean-fac'd villain
a mere anatomy a mountebank
a threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller
a needy hollow-ey'd sharp-looking wretch
a living-dead man This pernicious slave
forsooth took on him as a conjurer
and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
and with no face as twere out-facing me
cries out I was possess'd Then altogether
they fell upon me bound me bore me thence
and in a dark and dankish vault at home
there left me and my man both bound together
till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
ran hither to your Grace whom I beseech
to give me ample satisfaction
for these deep shames and great indignities

my lord in truth thus far I witness with him
that he din'd not at home but was lock'd out

but had he such a chain of thee or no

he had my lord and when he ran in here
these people saw the chain about his neck

besides I will be sworn these ears of mine
heard you confess you had the chain of him
after you first forswore it on the mart
and thereupon I drew my sword on you
and then you fled into this abbey here
from whence I think you are come by miracle

nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
I never saw the chain so help me heaven
and this is false you burden me withal

why what an intricate impeach is this
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup
if here you hous'd him here he would have been
if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
you say he din'd at home the goldsmith here
denies that saying Sirrah what say you

sir he din'd with her there at the Porpentine

he did and from my finger snatch'd that ring

'Tis true my liege this ring I had of her

saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here


why this is strange Go call the abbess hither

I think you are all mated or stark mad

most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
haply I see a friend will save my life
and pay the sum that may deliver me

speak freely Syracusian what thou wilt

is not your name sir called Antipholus
and is not that your bondman Dromio

within this hour I was his bondman sir
but he I thank him gnaw'd in two my cords
now am I Dromio and his man unbound

I am sure you both of you remember me
ourselves we do remember sir by you
for lately we were bound as you are now
you are not Pinch's patient are you sir

why look you strange on me you know me well

I never saw you in my life till now

O grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last
and careful hours with Time's deformed hand
have written strange defeatures in my face
but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice

neither

Dromio nor thou

no trust me sir not I


ay sir but I am sure I do not and whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe him

not know my voice O time's extremity
hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
in seven short years that here my only son
knows not my feeble key of untun'd cares
though now this grained face of mine be hid
in sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow
and all the conduits of my blood froze up
yet hath my night of life some memory
my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
all these old witnesses I cannot err
tell me thou art my son Antipholus

I never saw my father in my life

but seven years since in Syracusa boy
thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery

the duke and all that know me in the city
can witness with me that it is not so
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life

I tell thee Syracusian twenty years
have I been patron to Antipholus
during which time he ne'er saw Syracusa
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote


most mighty duke behold a man much wrong'd


I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me

one of these men is Genius to the other
and so of these which is the natural man

I sir am Dromio command him away

I sir am Dromio pray let me stay

geon art thou not or else his ghost

O my old master who hath bound him here

whoever bound him I will loose his bonds
and gain a husband by his liberty
speak old geon if thou be'st the man
that hadst a wife once call'd milia
that bore thee at a burden two fair sons
O if thou be'st the same geon speak
and speak unto the same milia

if I dream not thou art milia
if thou art she tell me where is that son

by men of Epidamnum he and I
and the twin Dromio all were taken up
but by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
by force took Dromio and my son from them
and me they left with those of Epidamnum
what then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in

why here begins his morning story right
these two Antipholus' these two so like
and these two Dromios one in semblance
besides her urging of her wrack at sea
these are the parents to these children
which accidentally are met together
Antipholus thou cam'st from Corinth first

no sir not I I came from Syracuse


I came from Corinth my most gracious lord

and I with him

brought to this town by that most famous warrior
duke Menaphon your most renowned uncle

which of you two did dine with me to-day

I gentle mistress

and are not you my husband

no I say nay to that

and so do I yet did she call me so
and this fair gentlewoman her sister here
did call me brother
what I told you then
I hope I shall have leisure to make good
if this be not a dream I see and hear

that is the chain sir which you had of me

I think it be sir I deny it not

and you sir for this chain arrested me

I think I did sir I deny it not

I sent you money sir to be your bail
by Dromio but I think he brought it not

no none by me

this purse of ducats I receiv'd from you
and Dromio my man did bring them me
and I was ta'en for him and he for me
and thereupon these errors are arose

these ducats pawn I for my father here

it shall not need thy father hath his life

sir I must have that diamond from you

there take it and much thanks for my good cheer

renowned duke vouchsafe to take the pains
to go with us into the abbey here
and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes
and all that are assembled in this place
that by this sympathized one day's error
have suffer'd wrong go keep us company
and we shall make full satisfaction
thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
my heavy burdens ne'er delivered
the duke my husband and my children both
and you the calendars of their nativity
go to a gossip's feast and joy with me
after so long grief such festivity

with all my heart I'll gossip at this feast


master shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard

Dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd

your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur

he speaks to me I am your master Dromio
come go with us we'll look to that anon
embrace thy brother there rejoice with him

there is a fat friend at your master's house
that kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner
she now shall be my sister not my wife

methinks you are my glass and not my brother
I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth
will you walk in to see their gossiping

not I sir you are my elder

that's a question how shall we try it

we'll draw cuts for the senior till then lead thou first

nay then thus
we came into the world like brother and brother
and now let's go hand in hand not one before another

THE MERCHANT OF VENICE

in sooth I know not why I am so sad
it wearies me you say it wearies you
but how I caught it found it or came by it
what stuff tis made of whereof it is born
I am to learn
and such a want-wit sadness makes of me
that I have much ado to know myself

your mind is tossing on the ocean
there where your argosies with portly sail
like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
or as it were the pageants of the sea
do overpeer the petty traffickers
that curtsy to them do them reverence
as they fly by them with their woven wings

believe me sir had I such venture forth
the better part of my affections would
plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
and every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
would make me sad

my wind cooling my broth
would blow me to an ague when I thought
what harm a wind too great might do at sea
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
but I should think of shallows and of flats
and see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand
vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
to kiss her burial Should I go to church
and see the holy edifice of stone
and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
which touching but my gentle vessel's side
would scatter all her spices on the stream
enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
and now worth nothing Shall I have the thought
to think on this and shall I lack the thought
that such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad
but tell not me I know Antonio
is sad to think upon his merchandise

believe me no I thank my fortune for it
my ventures are not in one bottom trusted
nor to one place nor is my whole estate
upon the fortune of this present year
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad

why then you are in love

fie fie

not in love neither Then let's say you are sad
because you are not merry and twere as easy
for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time
some that will evermore peep through their eyes
and laugh like parrots at a bag-piper
and other of such vinegar aspect
that they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
though Nestor swear the jest be laughable


here comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman
Gratiano and Lorenzo Fare ye well
we leave you now with better company

I would have stay'd till I had made you merry
if worthier friends had not prevented me

your worth is very dear in my regard
I take it your own business calls on you
and you embrace the occasion to depart


good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
you grow exceeding strange must it be so

we'll make our leisures to attend on yours


my Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio
we too will leave you but at dinner-time
I pray you have in mind where we must meet

I will not fail you

you look not well Signior Antonio
you have too much respect upon the world
they lose it that do buy it with much care
believe me you are marvellously chang'd

I hold the world but as the world Gratiano
and mine a sad one

let me play the fool
with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
and let my liver rather heat with wine
than my heart cool with mortifying groans
why should a man whose blood is warm within
sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
by being peevish I tell thee what Antonio
I love thee and it is my love that speaks
there are a sort of men whose visages
do cream and mantle like a standing pond
and do a wilful stillness entertain
with purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
of wisdom gravity profound conceit
as who should say I am Sir Oracle
and when I ope my lips let no dog bark
O my Antonio I do know of these
for saying nothing when I am very sure
if they should speak would almost damn those ears
which hearing them would call their brothers fools
I'll tell thee more of this another time
but fish not with this melancholy bait
for this fool-gudgeon this opinion
come good Lorenzo Fare ye well awhile
I'll end my exhortation after dinner

well we will leave you then till dinner-time
I must be one of these same dumb-wise men
for Gratiano never lets me speak

well keep me company but two years moe
thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue

farewell I'll grow a talker for this gear

thanks i' faith for silence is only commendable


is that anything now

Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search

well tell me now what lady is the same
to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
that you to-day promis'd to tell me of

'Tis not unknown to you Antonio
how much I have disabled mine estate
by something showing a more swelling port
than my faint means would grant continuance
nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd
from such a noble rate but my chief care
is to come fairly off from the great debts
wherein my time something too prodigal
hath left me gag'd To you Antonio
and from your love I have a warranty
to unburthen all my plots and purposes
how to get clear of all the debts I owe

I pray you good Bassanio let me know it
and if it stand as you yourself still do
within the eye of honour be assur'd
my purse my person my extremest means
lie all unlock'd to your occasions

in my school-days when I had lost one shaft
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
the self-same way with more advised watch
to find the other forth and by adventuring both
I oft found both I urge this childhood proof
because what follows is pure innocence
I owe you much and like a wilful youth
that which I owe is lost but if you please
to shoot another arrow that self way
as I will watch the aim or to find both
or bring your latter hazard back again
and thankfully rest debtor for the first

you know me well and herein spend but time
to wind about my love with circumstance
and out of doubt you do me now more wrong
in making question of my uttermost
than if you had made waste of all I have
then do but say to me what I should do
that in your knowledge may by me be done
and I am prest unto it therefore speak

in Belmont is a lady richly left
and she is fair and fairer than that word
of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages
her name is Portia nothing undervalu'd
to Cato's daughter Brutus' Portia
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors and her sunny locks
hang on her temples like a golden fleece
which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond
and many Jasons come in quest of her
O my Antonio had I but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them
I have a mind presages me such thrift
that I should questionless be fortunate

thou knowest that all my fortunes are at sea
neither have I money nor commodity
to raise a present sum therefore go forth
try what my credit can in Venice do
that shall be rack'd even to the uttermost
to furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia
go presently inquire and so will I
where money is and I no question make
to have it of my trust or for my sake

by my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world

you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer

good sentences and well pronounced

they would be better if well followed

if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces It is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband O me the word choose I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father Is it not hard Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse none

your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come

I pray thee over-name them and as thou namest them I will describe them and according to my description level at my affection

first there is the Neapolitan prince

ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith


he doth nothing but frown as who should say An you will not have me choose He hears merry tales and smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these God defend me from these two

how say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon

God made him and therefore let him pass for a man In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a-capering he will fence with his own shadow if I should marry him I should marry twenty husbands If he would despise me I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I shall never requite him

what say you then to Falconbridge the young baron of England

you know I say nothing to him for he understands not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English He is a proper man's picture but alas who can converse with a dumb-show How oddly he is suited I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his behaviour every where

what think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour

that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another

how like you the young German the Duke of Saxony's nephew

very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast An the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall make shift to go without him


therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without I know he will choose it I will do anything Nerissa ere I will be married to a sponge

you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition depending on the caskets

if I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant them a fair departure

do you not remember lady in your father's time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in the company of the Marquis of Montferrat

yes yes it was Bassanio as I think he was so called

true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady

I remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy praise

how now what news

the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here to-night

whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door


three thousand ducats well

ay sir for three months

for three months well

for the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound

Antonio shall become bound well

may you stead me Will you pleasure me Shall I know your answer

three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound

your answer to that


have you heard any imputation to the contrary

ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient Yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and other ventures he hath squandered abroad But ships are but boards sailors but men there be land-rats and water-rats land-thieves and water-thieves I mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks The man is notwithstanding sufficient Three thousand ducats I think I may take his bond

be assured you may

I will be assured I may and that I may be assured I will bethink me May I speak with Antonio

if it please you to dine with us

yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but I will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you What news on the Rialto Who is he comes here


this is Signior Antonio

how like a fawning publican he looks
I hate him for he is a Christian
but more for that in low simplicity
the rate of usance here with us in Venice
if I can catch him once upon the hip
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him
he hates our sacred nation and he rails
even there where merchants most do congregate
on me my bargains and my well-won thrift
which he calls interest Cursed be my tribe
if I forgive him

Shylock do you hear

I am debating of my present store
and by the near guess of my memory
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
of full three thousand ducats What of that
Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe
will furnish me But soft how many months
do you desire

your worship was the last man in our mouths

Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow
by taking nor by giving of excess
yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
I'll break a custom

is he yet possess'd
how much ye would

ay ay three thousand ducats

and for three months

I had forgot three months you told me so
well then your bond and let me see But hear you
methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
upon advantage


when Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep
this Jacob from our holy Abram was
as his wise mother wrought in his behalf
the third possessor ay he was the third

and what of him did he take interest

no not take interest not as you would say
directly interest mark what Jacob did
when Laban and himself were compromis'd
that all the eanlings that were streak'd and pied
should fall as Jacob's hire the ewes being rank
in end of autumn turned to the rams
and when the work of generation was
between these woolly breeders in the act
the skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands
and in the doing of the deed of kind
he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
fall parti-colour'd lambs and those were Jacob's
this was a way to thrive and he was blest
and thrift is blessing if men steal it not

this was a venture sir that Jacob serv'd for
a thing not in his power to bring to pass
but sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven
was this inserted to make interest good
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams

I cannot tell I make it breed as fast But note me signior

mark you this Bassanio
the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose
an evil soul producing holy witness
is like a villain with a smiling cheek
a goodly apple rotten at the heart
O what a goodly outside falsehood hath

three months from twelve then let me see the rate

well Shylock shall we be beholding to you

Signior Antonio many a time and oft
in the Rialto you have rated me
about my moneys and my usances
still have I borne it with a patient shrug
for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe
you call me misbeliever cut-throat dog
and spet upon my Jewish gaberdine
and all for use of that which is mine own
well then it now appears you need my help
go to then you come to me and you say
'Shylock we would have moneys you say so
you that did void your rheum upon my beard
and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
over your threshold moneys is your suit
what should I say to you Should I not say
a cur can lend three thousand ducats or
shall I bend low and in a bondman's key
with bated breath and whispering humbleness
say this
'Fair sir you spet on me on Wednesday last
you spurn'd me such a day another time
you call'd me dog and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys

I am as like to call thee so again
to spet on thee again to spurn thee too
if thou wilt lend this money lend it not
as to thy friends for when did friendship take
a breed for barren metal of his friend
but lend it rather to thine enemy
who if he break thou mayst with better face
exact the penalty

why look you how you storm
forget the shames that you have stain'd me with
supply your present wants and take no doit
of usance for my moneys and you'll not hear me
this is kind I offer

this were kindness

this kindness will I show
go with me to a notary seal me there
your single bond and in a merry sport
if you repay me not on such a day
in such a place such sum or sums as are
express'd in the condition let the forfeit
be nominated for an equal pound
of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
in what part of your body pleaseth me

content i' faith I'll seal to such a bond
and say there is much kindness in the Jew
you shall not seal to such a bond for me
I'll rather dwell in my necessity

why fear not man I will not forfeit it
within these two months that's a month before
this bond expires I do expect return
of thrice three times the value of this bond

O father Abram what these Christians are
whose own hard dealing teaches them suspect
the thoughts of others Pray you tell me this
if he should break his day what should I gain
by the exaction of the forfeiture
a pound of man's flesh taken from a man
is not so estimable profitable neither
as flesh of muttons beefs or goats I say
to buy his favour I extend this friendship
if he will take it so if not adieu
and for my love I pray you wrong me not
yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond

then meet me forthwith at the notary's
give him direction for this merry bond
and I will go and purse the ducats straight
see to my house left in the fearful guard
of an unthrifty knave and presently
I will be with you

hie thee gentle Jew

this Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind

I like not fair terms and a villain's mind

come on in this there can be no dismay
my ships come home a month before the day


the shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun
to whom I am a neighbour and near bred
bring me the fairest creature northward born
where Ph bus' fire scarce thaws the icicles
and let us make incision for your love
to prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
I tell thee lady this aspect of mine
hath fear'd the valiant by my love I swear
the best regarded virgins of our clime
have lov'd it too I would not change this hue
except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen

in terms of choice I am not solely led
by nice direction of a maiden's eyes
besides the lottery of my destiny
bars me the right of voluntary choosing
but if my father had not scanted me
and hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself
his wife who wins me by that means I told you
as any comer I have look'd on yet
for my affection

even for that I thank you
therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets
to try my fortune By this scimitar
that slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
that won three fields of Sultan Solyman
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look
outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear
yea mock the lion when he roars for prey
to win thee lady But alas the while
if Hercules and Lichas play at dice
which is the better man the greater throw
may turn by fortune from the weaker hand
so is Alcides beaten by his page
and so may I blind fortune leading me
miss that which one unworthier may attain

you must take your chance
and either not attempt to choose at all
or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
never to speak to lady afterward
in way of marriage therefore be advis'd

nor will not come bring me unto my chance

first forward to the temple after dinner
your hazard shall be made

good fortune then
to make me blest or cursed'st among men


certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying to me Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good Launcelot or good Gobbo or good Launcelot Gobbo use your legs take the start run away My conscience says No take heed honest Launcelot take heed honest Gobbo or as aforesaid honest Launcelot Gobbo do not run scorn running with thy heels Well the most courageous fiend bids me pack Via says the fiend away says the fiend for the heavens rouse up a brave mind says the fiend and run Well my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely to me My honest friend Launcelot being an honest man's son or rather an honest woman's son for indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a kind of taste well my conscience says Launcelot budge not Budge says the fiend Budge not says my conscience Conscience say I you counsel well fiend say I you counsel well to be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master who God bless the mark is a kind of devil and to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend who saving your reverence is the devil himself Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnal and in my conscience my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew The fiend gives the more friendly counsel I will run fiend my heels are at your commandment I will run



O heavens this is my truebegotten father who being more than sandblind high-gravel blind knows me not I will try confusions with him

master young gentleman I pray you which is the way to Master Jew's

turn up on your right hand at the next turning but at the next turning of all on your left marry at the very next turning turn of no hand but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house

by God's sonties twill be a hard way to hit Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him dwell with him or no

talk you of young Master Launcelot

mark me now now will I raise the waters Talk you of young Master Launcelot

no master sir but a poor man's son his father though I say it is an honest exceeding poor man and God be thanked well to live

well let his father be what a' will we talk of young Master Launcelot

your worship's friend and Launcelot sir


of Launcelot an't please your mastership

ergo Master Launcelot Talk not of Master Launcelot father for the young gentleman according to Fates and Destinies and such odd sayings the Sisters Three and such branches of learning is indeed deceased or as you would say in plain terms gone to heaven

marry God forbid the boy was the very staff of my age my very prop

do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post a staff or a prop Do you know me father

alack the day I know you not young gentleman but I pray you tell me is my boy God rest his soul alive or dead

do you not know me father

alack sir I am sand-blind I know you not

nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me it is a wise father that knows his own child Well old man I will tell you news of your son Give me your blessing truth will come to light murder cannot be hid long a man's son may but in the end truth will out

pray you sir stand up I am sure you are not Launcelot my boy


I cannot think you are my son

I know not what I shall think of that but I am Launcelot the Jew's man and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother

her name is Margery indeed I'll be sworn if thou be Launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood Lord worshipped might he be what a beard hast thou got thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my thill-horse has on his tail

it should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows backward I am sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him

lord how art thou changed How dost thou and thy master agree I have brought him a present How gree you now

well well but for mine own part as I have set up my rest to run away so I will not rest till I have run some ground My master's a very Jew give him a present give him a halter I am farnished in his service you may tell every finger I have with my ribs Father I am glad you are come give me your present to one Master Bassanio who indeed gives rare new liveries If I serve not him I will run as far as God has any ground O rare fortune here comes the man to him father for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer


you may do so but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the very furthest by five of the clock See these letters delivered put the liveries to making and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging


to him father


gramercy wouldst thou aught with me

here's my son sir a poor boy

not a poor boy sir but the rich Jew's man that would sir as my father shall specify

he hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve

indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew and have a desire as my father shall specify

his master and he saving your worship's reverence are scarce cater-cousins

to be brief the very truth is that the Jew having done me wrong doth cause me as my father being I hope an old man shall frutify unto you

I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship and my suit is

in very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as your worship shall know by this honest old man and though I say it though old man yet poor man my father


serve you sir

that is the very defect of the matter sir

I know thee well thou hast obtain'd thy suit
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day
and hath preferr'd thee if it be preferment
to leave a rich Jew's service to become
the follower of so poor a gentleman

the old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you sir you have the grace of God sir and he hath enough

thou speak'st it well Go father with thy son
take leave of thy old master and inquire
my lodging out

give him a livery
more guarded than his fellows' see it done
father in I cannot get a service no I have ne'er a tongue in my head Well

if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book I shall have good fortune Go to here's a simple line of life here's a small trifle of wives alas fifteen wives is nothing a leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man and then to scape drowning thrice and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed here are simple scapes Well if Fortune be a woman she's a good wench for this gear Father come I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye


I pray thee good Leonardo think on this
these things being bought and orderly bestow'd
return in haste for I do feast to-night
my best-esteem'd acquaintance hie thee go

my best endeavours shall be done herein


where is your master

yonder sir he walks


Signior Bassanio
Gratiano

I have a suit to you

you have obtain'd it

you must not deny me I must go with you to Belmont

why then you must But hear thee Gratiano
thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice
parts that become thee happily enough
and in such eyes as ours appear not faults
but where thou art not known why there they show
something too liberal Pray thee take pain
to allay with some cold drops of modesty
thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behaviour
I be misconstru'd in the place I go to
and lose my hopes

if I do not put on a sober habit
talk with respect and swear but now and then
wear prayer-books in my pocket look demurely
nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes
thus with my hat and sigh and say amen
use all the observance of civility
like one well studied in a sad ostent
to please his grandam never trust me more

well we shall see your bearing

nay but I bar to-night you shall not gauge me
by what we do to-night

no that were pity
I would entreat you rather to put on
your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends
that purpose merriment But fare you well
I have some business
and I must to Lorenzo and the rest
but we will visit you at supper-time


I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so
our house is hell and thou a merry devil
didst rob it of some taste of tediousness
but fare thee well there is a ducat for thee
and Launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see
Lorenzo who is thy new master's guest
give him this letter do it secretly
and so farewell I would not have my father
see me in talk with thee

adieu tears exhibit my tongue Most beautiful pagan most sweet Jew If a Christian did not play the knave and get thee I am much deceived But adieu these foolish drops do somewhat drown my manly spirit adieu

farewell good Launcelot

alack what heinous sin is it in me
but though I am a daughter to his blood
I am not to his manners O Lorenzo
if thou keep promise I shall end this strife
become a Christian and thy loving wife


nay we will slink away in supper-time
disguise us at my lodging and return
all in an hour

we have not made good preparation

we have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers

'Tis vile unless it may be quaintly order'd
and better in my mind not undertook

'Tis now but four o'clock we have two hours
to furnish us
friend Launcelot what's the news

an it shall please you to break up this it shall seem to signify

I know the hand in faith tis a fair hand
and whiter than the paper it writ on
is the fair hand that writ

love news in faith

by your leave sir

whither goest thou

marry sir to bid my old master the Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian

hold here take this tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her speak it privately
go gentlemen
will you prepare you for this masque to-night
I am provided of a torch-bearer

ay marry I'll be gone about it straight

and so will I

meet me and Gratiano
at Gratiano's lodging some hour hence

'Tis good we do so


was not that letter from fair Jessica

I must needs tell thee all She hath directed
how I shall take her from her father's house
what gold and jewels she is furnish'd with
what page's suit she hath in readiness
it will be for his gentle daughter's sake
and never dare misfortune cross her foot
unless she do it under this excuse
that she is issue to a faithless Jew
come go with me peruse this as thou goest
fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer


well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge
the difference of old Shylock and Bassanio
what Jessical thou shalt not gormandize
as thou hast done with me What Jessical
and sleep and snore and rend apparel out
why Jessica I say

why Jessica

who bids thee call I do not bid thee call

I could do nothing without bidding


call you What is your will

I am bid forth to supper Jessica
there are my keys But wherefore should I go
I am not bid for love they flatter me
but yet I'll go in hate to feed upon
the prodigal Christian Jessica my girl
look to my house I am right loath to go
there is some ill a-brewing towards my rest
for I did dream of money-bags to-night

I beseech you sir go my young master doth expect your reproach

so do I his

and they have conspired together I will not say you shall see a masque but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in the afternoon
what are there masques Hear you me Jessica
lock up my doors and when you hear the drum
and the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife
clamber not you up to the casements then
nor thrust your head into the public street
to gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces
but stop my house's ears I mean my casements
let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
my sober house By Jacob's staff I swear
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night
but I will go Go you before me sirrah
say I will come

I will go before air Mistress look out at window for all this

there will come a Christian by
will be worth a Jewess' eye

what says that fool of Hagar's offspring ha
his words were Farewell mistress nothing else

the patch is kind enough but a huge feeder
snail-slow in profit and he sleeps by day
more than the wild cat drones hive not with me
therefore I part with him and part with him
to one that I would have him help to waste
his borrow'd purse Well Jessica go in
perhaps I will return immediately
do as I bid you shut doors after you
'Fast bind fast find
a proverb never stale in thrifty mind


farewell and if my fortune be not crost
I have a father you a daughter lost


this is the penthouse under which Lorenzo

his hour is almost past

and it is marvel he out-dwells his hour
for lovers ever run before the clock

O ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
to seal love's bonds new-made than they are wont
to keep obliged faith unforfeited

that ever holds who riseth from a feast
with that keen appetite that he sits down
where is the horse that doth untread again
his tedious measures with the unbated fire
that he did pace them first All things that are
are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd
how like a younker or a prodigal
the scarfed bark puts from her native bay
hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind
with over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails
lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind

here comes Lorenzo more of this hereafter


sweet friends your patience for my long abode
not I but my affairs have made you wait
when you shall please to play the thieves for wives
I'll watch as long for you then Approach
here dwells my father Jew Ho who's within


who are you Tell me for more certainty
albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue

Lorenzo and thy love

Lorenzo certain and my love indeed
but you Lorenzo whether I am yours

heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art

here catch this casket it is worth the pains
I am glad tis night you do not look on me
for I am much asham'd of my exchange
but love is blind and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit
for if they could Cupid himself would blush
to see me thus transformed to a boy

descend for you must be my torch-bearer

what must I hold a candle to my shames
they in themselves good sooth are too-too light
why tis an office of discovery love
and I should be obscur'd

even in the lovely garnish of a boy
but come at once
for the close night doth play the runaway
and we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast

I will make fast the doors and gild myself
with some more ducats and be with you straight


now by my hood a Gentile and no Jew

beshrew me but I love her heartily
for she is wise if I can judge of her
and fair she is if that mine eyes be true
and true she is as she hath prov'd herself
and therefore like herself wise fair and true
shall she be placed in my constant soul


our masquing mates by this time for us stay


who's there

Signior Antonio

fie fie Gratiano where are all the rest
'Tis nine o'clock our friends all stay for you
no masque to-night the wind is come about
Bassanio presently will go aboard
I have sent twenty out to seek for you

I am glad on't I desire no more delight
than to be under sail and gone to-night


go draw aside the curtains and discover
the several caskets to this noble prince

the first of gold which this inscription bears
who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
the second silver which this promise carries
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
this third dull lead with warning all as blunt
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
how shall I know if I do choose the right

the one of them contains my picture prince
if you choose that then I am yours withal

some god direct my judgment Let me see
I will survey the inscriptions back again
what says this leaden casket
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
must give For what for lead hazard for lead
this casket threatens Men that hazard all
do it in hope of fair advantages
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
what says the silver with her virgin hue
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
as much as he deserves Pause there Morocco
and weigh thy value with an even hand
if thou be'st rated by thy estimation
thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
may not extend so far as to the lady
and yet to be afeard of my deserving
were but a weak disabling of myself
as much as I deserve Why that's the lady
I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
in graces and in qualities of breeding
but more than these in love I do deserve
what if I stray'd no further but chose here
let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold
who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
why that's the lady all the world desires her
from the four corners of the earth they come
the Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
for princes to come view fair Portia
the watery kingdom whose ambitious head
spits in the face of heaven is no bar
to stop the foreign spirits but they come
as o'er a brook to see fair Portia
one of these three contains her heavenly picture
is't like that lead contains her Twere damnation
to think so base a thought it were too gross
to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
or shall I think in silver she's immur'd
being ten times undervalu'd to tried gold
O sinful thought Never so rich a gem
was set in worse than gold They have in England
a coin that bears the figure of an angel
stamped in gold but that's insculp'd upon
but here an angel in a golden bed
lies all within Deliver me the key

there take it prince and if my form lie there
then I am yours


O hell what have we here
a carrion Death within whose empty eye
there is a written scroll I'll read the writing

all that glisters is not gold
often have you heard that told
many a man his life hath sold
but my outside to behold
gilded tombs do worms infold
had you been as wise as bold
young in limbs in judgment old
your answer had not been inscroll'd
fare you well your suit is cold

then farewell heat and welcome frost
Portia adieu I have too griev'd a heart
to take a tedious leave thus losers part


a gentle riddance Draw the curtains go
let all of his complexion choose me so


why man I saw Bassanio under sail
with him is Gratiano gone along
and in their ship I'm sure Lorenzo is not

the villain Jew with outcries rais'd the duke
who went with him to search Bassanio's ship

he came too late the ship was under sail
but there the duke was given to understand
that in a gondola were seen together
besides Antonio certified the duke
they were not with Bassanio in his ship

I never heard a passion so confus'd
so strange outrageous and so variable
as the dog Jew did utter in the streets
'My daughter O my ducats O my daughter
fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats
justice the law my ducats and my daughter
a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
of double ducats stol'n from me by my daughter
and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones
stol'n by my daughter Justice find the girl
she hath the stones upon her and the ducats

why all the boys in Venice follow him
crying his stones his daughter and his ducats

let good Antonio look he keep his day

marry well remember'd
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday
who told me in the narrow seas that part
the French and English there miscarried
a vessel of our country richly fraught
I thought upon Antonio when he told me
and wish'd in silence that it were not his

you were best to tell Antonio what you hear
yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him

a kinder gentleman treads not the earth
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
of his return he answer'd Do not so
slubber not business for my sake Bassanio
but stay the very riping of the time
and for the Jew's bond which he hath of me
be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
to courtship and such fair ostents of love
as shall conveniently become you there
and even there his eye being big with tears
turning his face he put his hand behind him
and with affection wondrous sensible
he wrung Bassanio's hand and so they parted

I think he only loves the world for him
I pray thee let us go and find him out
and quicken his embraced heaviness
with some delight or other

do we so


quick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straight
the Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath
and comes to his election presently

behold there stands the caskets noble prince
if you choose that wherein I am contain'd
straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd
but if you fail without more speech my lord
you must be gone from hence immediately

I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things
first never to unfold to any one
which casket twas I chose next if I fail
of the right casket never in my life
to woo a maid in way of marriage
lastly
if I do fail in fortune of my choice
immediately to leave you and be gone

to these injunctions every one doth swear
that comes to hazard for my worthless self

to my heart's hope Gold silver and base lead
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
you shall look fairer ere I give or hazard
what says the golden chest ha let me see
who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
what many men desire that many' may be meant
by the fool multitude that choose by show
not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
which pries not to the interior but like the martlet
builds in the weather on the outward wall
even in the force and road of casualty
I will not choose what many men desire
because I will not jump with common spirits
and rank me with the barbarous multitude
why then to thee thou silver treasure-house
tell me once more what title thou dost bear
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
and well said too for who shall go about
to cozen fortune and be honourable
to wear an undeserved dignity
O that estates degrees and offices
were not deriv'd corruptly and that clear honour
were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer
how many then should cover that stand bare
how many be commanded that command
how much low peasantry would then be glean'd
from the true seed of honour and how much honour
pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
to be new varnish'd Well but to my choice
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
I will assume desert Give me a key for this
and instantly unlock my fortunes here


too long a pause for that which you find there

what's here the portrait of a blinking idiot
presenting me a schedule I will read it
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings
who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves
did I deserve no more than a fool's head
is that my prize are my deserts no better

to offend and judge are distinct offices
and of opposed natures

what is here

the fire seven times tried this
seven times tried that judgment is
that did never choose amiss
some there be that shadows kiss
such have but a shadow's bliss
there be fools alive I wis
silver'd o'er and so was this
take what wife you will to bed
I will ever be your head


still more fool I shall appear
by the time I linger here
with one fool's head I came to woo
but I go away with two
sweet adieu I'll keep my oath
patiently to bear my wroth

thus hath the candle sing'd the moth
O these deliberate fools when they do choose
they have the wisdom by their wit to lose

the ancient saying is no heresy
'Hanging and wiving goes by destiny

come draw the curtain Nerissa



here what would my lord

madam there is alighted at your gate
a young Venetian one that comes before
to signify the approaching of his lord
from whom he bringeth sensible regreets
to wit besides commends and courteous breath
gifts of rich value Yet I have not seen
so likely an embassador of love
a day in April never came so sweet
to show how costly summer was at hand
as this fore-spurrer comes before his lord

no more I pray thee I am half afeard
thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee
thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him
come come Nerissa for I long to see
quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly
Bassanio lord Love if thy will it be

now what news on the Rialto

why yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas the Goodwins I think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word

I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband But it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the honest Antonio O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company

come the full stop

ha what sayst thou Why the end is he hath lost a ship

I would it might prove the end of his losses

let me say amen' betimes lest the devil cross my prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew

how now Shylock what news among the merchants

you knew none so well none so well as you of my daughter's flight
that's certain I for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal

and Shylock for his own part knew the bird was fledged and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam

she is damned for it

that's certain if the devil may be her judge

my own flesh and blood to rebel

out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years

I say my daughter is my flesh and blood

there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish But tell us do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no

there I have another bad match a bankrupt a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart let him look to his bond he was wont to call me usurer let him look to his bond he was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy let him look to his bond

why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh what's that good for
to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else it will feed my revenge He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million laughed at my losses mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine enemies and what's his reason I am a Jew Hath not a Jew eyes hath not a Jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is If you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not revenge If we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that If a Jew wrong a Christian what is his humility Revenge If a Christian wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be by Christian example Why revenge The villany you teach me I will execute and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction


gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both

we have been up and down to seek him


here comes another of the tribe a third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew


how now Tubal what news from Genoa Hast thou found my daughter

I often came where I did hear of her but cannot find her

why there there there a diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort The curse never fell upon our nation till now I never felt it till now two thousand ducats in that and other precious precious jewels I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin No news of them Why so and I know not what's spent in the search Why thou loss upon loss the thief gone with so much and so much to find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge nor no ill luck stirring but what lights on my shoulders no sighs but of my breathing no tears but of my shedding

yes other men have ill luck too Antonio as I heard in Genoa


hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis

I thank God I thank God Is it true is it true

I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack

I thank thee good Tubal Good news good news ha ha Where in Genoa

your daughter spent in Genoa as I heard one night fourscore ducats

thou stick'st a dagger in me I shall never see my gold again fourscore ducats at a sitting fourscore ducats

there came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break

I am very glad of it I'll plague him I'll torture him I am glad of it

one of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey


but Antonio is certainly undone

nay that's true that's very true Go Tubal fee me an officer bespeak him a fortnight before I will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will Go go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue go good Tubal at our synagogue Tubal


I pray you tarry pause a day or two
before you hazard for in choosing wrong
I lose your company therefore forbear awhile
there's something tells me but it is not love
I would not lose you and you know yourself
hate counsels not in such a quality
but lest you should not understand me well
and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
I would detain you here some month or two
before you venture for me I could teach you
how to choose right but then I am forsworn
so will I never be so may you miss me
but if you do you'll make me wish a sin
they have o'erlook'd me and divided me
one half of me is yours the other half yours
mine own I would say but if mine then yours
and so all yours O these naughty times
put bars between the owners and their rights
and so though yours not yours Prove it so
let fortune go to hell for it not I
I speak too long but tis to peise the time
to eke it and to draw it out in length
to stay you from election

let me choose
for as I am I live upon the rack

upon the rack Bassanio then confess
what treason there is mingled with your love

none but that ugly treason of mistrust
which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love
'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love

ay but I fear you speak upon the rack
where men enforced do speak anything

promise me life and I'll confess the truth

well then confess and live

'Confess' and love'
had been the very sum of my confession
O happy torment when my torturer
doth teach me answers for deliverance
but let me to my fortune and the caskets

away then I am lock'd in one of them
if you do love me you will find me out
Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
let music sound while he doth make his choice
fading in music that the comparison
may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
and watery death-bed for him He may win
and what is music then then music is
even as the flourish when true subjects bow
to a new-crowned monarch such it is
as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
and summon him to marriage Now he goes
with no less presence but with much more love
than young Alcides when he did redeem
the virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
to the sea-monster I stand for sacrifice
the rest aloof are the Dardanian wives
with bleared visages come forth to view
the issue of the exploit Go Hercules
live thou I live with much much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray

tell me where is fancy bred
or in the heart or in the head
how begot how nourished
reply reply
it is engender'd in the eyes
with gazing fed and fancy dies
in the cradle where it lies
let us all ring fancy's knell
I'll begin it Ding dong bell


ding dong bell

so may the outward shows be least themselves
the world is still deceiv'd with ornament
in law what plea so tainted and corrupt
but being season'd with a gracious voice
obscures the show of evil In religion
what damned error but some sober brow
hiding the grossness with fair ornament
there is no vice so simple but assumes
some mark of virtue on his outward parts
how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
the beards of Hercules and frowning Mars
who inward search'd have livers white as milk
and these assume but valour's excrement
to render them redoubted Look on beauty
and you shall see tis purchas'd by the weight
which therein works a miracle in nature
making them lightest that wear most of it
so are those crisped snaky golden locks
which make such wanton gambols with the wind
upon supposed fairness often known
to be the dowry of a second head
the skull that bred them in the sepulchre
thus ornament is but the guiled shore
to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
the seeming truth which cunning times put on
to entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold
hard food for Midas I will none of thee
nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
which rather threat'nest than dost promise aught
thy plainness moves me more than eloquence
and here choose I joy be the consequence

how all the other passions fleet to air
as doubtful thoughts and rash-embrac'd despair
and shuddering fear and green-ey'd jealousy
O love be moderate allay thy ecstasy
in measure rain thy joy scant this excess
I feel too much thy blessing make it less
for fear I surfeit

what find I here

hath come so near creation Move these eyes
or whether riding on the balls of mine
seem they in motion Here are sever'd lips
parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs
the painter plays the spider and hath woven
a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes
how could he see to do them having made one
methinks it should have power to steal both his
and leave itself unfurnish'd yet look how far
the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
in underprizing it so far this shadow
doth limp behind the substance Here's the scroll
the continent and summary of my fortune

you that choose not by the view
chance as fair and choose as true
since this fortune falls to you
if you be well pleas'd with this
and hold your fortune for your bliss
turn you where your lady is
and claim her with a loving kiss

a gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave

I come by note to give and to receive
like one of two contending in a prize
that thinks he hath done well in people's eyes
hearing applause and universal shout
giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
whether those peals of praise be his or no
so thrice-fair lady stand I even so
as doubtful whether what I see be true
until confirm'd sign'd ratified by you

you see me Lord Bassanio where I stand
such as I am though for myself alone
to wish myself much better yet for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself
a thousand times more fair ten thousand times
more rich
that only to stand high in your account
I might in virtues beauties livings friends
exceed account but the full sum of me
is sum of nothing which to term in gross
is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractis'd
happy in this she is not yet so old
but she may learn happier than this
she is not bred so dull but she can learn
happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
commits itself to yours to be directed
as from her lord her governor her king
myself and what is mine to you and yours
is now converted but now I was the lord
of this fair mansion master of my servants
queen o'er myself and even now but now
are yours my lord I give them with this ring
which when you part from lose or give away
let it presage the ruin of your love
and be my vantage to exclaim on you

madam you have bereft me of all words
only my blood speaks to you in my veins
and there is such confusion in my powers
as after some oration fairly spoke
by a beloved prince there doth appear
among the buzzing pleased multitude
where every something being blent together
turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
express'd and not express'd But when this ring
parts from this finger then parts life from hence
O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead

my lord and lady it is now our time
that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper

my Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady
I wish you all the joy that you can wish
for I am sure you can wish none from me
and when your honours mean to solemnize
the bargain of your faith I do beseech you
even at that time I may be married too

with all my heart so thou canst get a wife

I thank your lordship you have got me one
my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
you saw the mistress I beheld the maid
you lov'd I lov'd for intermission
no more pertains to me my lord than you
your fortune stood upon the caskets there
and so did mine too as the matter falls
for wooing here until I sweat again
and swearing till my very roof was dry
I got a promise of this fair one here
to have her love provided that your fortune
achiev'd her mistress

is this true Nerissa

madam it is so you stand pleas'd withal

and do you Gratiano mean good faith

yes faith my lord

our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage

we'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats

what and stake down

no we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down
what and my old Venetian friend Salanio


Lorenzo and Salanio welcome hither
if that the youth of my new interest here
have power to bid you welcome By your leave
I bid my very friends and countrymen
sweet Portia welcome

so do I my lord
they are entirely welcome

I thank your honour For my part my lord
my purpose was not to have seen you here
but meeting with Salanio by the way
he did entreat me past all saying nay
to come with him along

I did my lord
commends him to you


ere I ope his letter
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth

not sick my lord unless it be in mind
nor well unless in mind his letter there
will show you his estate

Nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
your hand Salanio What's the news from Venice
how doth that royal merchant good Antonio
I know he will be glad of our success
we are the Jasons we have won the fleece

I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost

there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
could turn so much the constitution
of any constant man What worse and worse
with leave Bassanio I am half yourself
and I must freely have the half of anything
that this same paper brings you

O sweet Portia
here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
that ever blotted paper Gentle lady
when I did first impart my love to you
I freely told you all the wealth I had
ran in my veins I was a gentleman
and then I told you true and yet dear lady
rating myself at nothing you shall see
how much I was a braggart When I told you
my state was nothing I should then have told you
that I was worse than nothing for indeed
I have engag'd myself to a dear friend
to feed my means Here is a letter lady
the paper as the body of my friend
and every word in it a gaping wound
issuing life-blood But is it true Salanio
hath all his ventures fail'd What not one hit
from Tripolis from Mexico and England
from Lisbon Barbary and India
and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
of merchant-marring rocks

not one my lord
besides it should appear that if he had
the present money to discharge the Jew
he would not take it Never did I know
a creature that did bear the shape of man
so keen and greedy to confound a man
he plies the duke at morning and at night
and doth impeach the freedom of the state
if they deny him justice twenty merchants
of greatest port have all persuaded with him
but none can drive him from the envious plea
of forfeiture of justice and his bond

when I was with him I have heard him swear
to Tubal and to Chus his countrymen
that he would rather have Antonio's flesh
than twenty times the value of the sum
that he did owe him and I know my lord
if law authority and power deny not
it will go hard with poor Antonio

is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble

the dearest friend to me the kindest man
the best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
in doing courtesies and one in whom
the ancient Roman honour more appears
than any that draws breath in Italy
what sum owes he the Jew

for me three thousand ducats

what no more
pay him six thousand and deface the bond
double six thousand and then treble that
before a friend of this description
shall lose a hair thorough Bassanio's fault
first go with me to church and call me wife
and then away to Venice to your friend
for never shall you lie by Portia's side
with an unquiet soul You shall have gold
to pay the petty debt twenty times over
when it is paid bring your true friend along
my maid Nerissa and myself meantime
will live as maids and widows Come away
for you shall hence upon your wedding-day
bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
but let me hear the letter of your friend

sweet Bassanio my ships have all miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I should live all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death Notwithstanding use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter

O love dispatch all business and be gone

since I have your good leave to go away
I will make haste but till I come again
no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay
nor rest be interposer twixt us twain


gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy
this is the fool that lent out money gratis
gaoler look to him

hear me yet good Shylock

I'll have my bond speak not against my bond
thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause
but since I am a dog beware my fangs
the duke shall grant me justice I do wonder
thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
to come abroad with him at his request

I pray thee hear me speak

I'll have my bond I will not hear thee speak
I'll have my bond and therefore speak no more
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool
to shake the head relent and sigh and yield
to Christian intercessors Follow not
I'll have no speaking I will have my bond


it is the most impenetrable cur
that ever kept with men

I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers
he seeks my life his reason well I know
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
many that have at times made moan to me
therefore he hates me

I am sure the duke
will never grant this forfeiture to hold

the duke cannot deny the course of law
for the commodity that strangers have
with us in Venice if it be denied
'Twill much impeach the justice of the state
since that the trade and profit of the city
consisteth of all nations Therefore go
these griefs and losses have so bated me
that I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
to-morrow to my bloody creditor
well gaoler on Pray God Bassanio come


madam although I speak it in your presence
you have a noble and a true conceit
of god-like amity which appears most strongly
in bearing thus the absence of your lord
but if you knew to whom you show this honour
how true a gentleman you send relief
how dear a lover of my lord your husband
I know you would be prouder of the work
than customary bounty can enforce you

I never did repent for doing good
nor shall not now for in companions
that do converse and waste the time together
whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
there must be needs a like proportion
of lineaments of manners and of spirit
which makes me think that this Antonio
must needs be like my lord If it be so
how little is the cost I have bestow'd
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out the state of hellish cruelty
this comes too near the praising of myself
therefore no more of it hear other things
Lorenzo I commit into your hands
the husbandry and manage of my house
until my lord's return for mine own part
I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow
to live in prayer and contemplation
only attended by Nerissa here
until her husband and my lord's return
there is a monastery two miles off
and there will we abide I do desire you
not to deny this imposition
the which my love and some necessity
now lays upon you

I shall obey you in all fair commands

my people do already know my mind
and will acknowledge you and Jessica
in place of Lord Bassanio and myself
so fare you well till we shall meet again

fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you

I wish your ladyship all heart's content

I thank you for your wish and am well pleas'd
to wish it back on you fare you well Jessica

now Balthazar
as I have ever found thee honest-true
so let me find thee still Take this same letter
and use thou all the endeavour of a man
in speed to Padua see thou render this
and look what notes and garments he doth give thee
bring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed
unto the traject to the common ferry
which trades to Venice Waste no time in words
but get thee gone I shall be there before thee

madam I go with all convenient speed


come on Nerissa I have work in hand
that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands
before they think of us

shall they see us

they shall Nerissa but in such a habit
that they shall think we are accomplished
with that we lack I'll hold thee any wager
when we are both accoutred like young men
and wear my dagger with the braver grace
and speak between the change of man and boy
with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
into a manly stride and speak of frays
like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
how honourable ladies sought my love
which I denying they fell sick and died
I could not do withal then I'll repent
and wish for all that that I had not kill'd them
and twenty of these puny lies I'll tell
that men shall swear I have discontinu'd school
above a twelvemonth I have within my mind
a thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks
which I will practise

why shall we turn to men

fie what a question's that
if thou wert near a lewd interpreter
when I am in my coach which stays for us
at the park gate and therefore haste away
for we must measure twenty miles to-day


yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore I promise you I fear you I was always plain with you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter therefore be of good cheer for truly I think you are damned There is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither

and what hope is that I pray thee

marry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the Jew's daughter

that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me

truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways

I shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a Christian

truly the more to blame he we were Christians enow before e'en as many as could well live one by another This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be pork-eaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money



I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners

nay you need not fear us Lorenzo Launcelot and I are out He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew's daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork

I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro's belly the Moor is with child by you Launcelot

it is much that the Moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her for

how every fool can play upon the word I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots Go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner

that is done sir they have all stomachs

goodly Lord what a wit-snapper are you then bid them prepare dinner

that is done too sir only cover' is the word

will you cover then sir
not so sir neither I know my duty

yet more quarrelling with occasion Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner

for the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern


O dear discretion how his words are suited
the fool hath planted in his memory
an army of good words and I do know
a many fools that stand in better place
garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word
defy the matter How cheer'st thou Jessica
and now good sweet say thy opinion
how dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife

past all expressing It is very meet
the Lord Bassanio live an upright life
for having such a blessing in his lady
and if on earth he do not mean it then
in reason he should never come to heaven
why if two gods should play some heavenly match
and on the wager lay two earthly women
and Portia one there must be something else
pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world
hath not her fellow

even such a husband
hast thou of me as she is for a wife

nay but ask my opinion too of that

I will anon first let us go to dinner

nay let me praise you while I have a stomach

no pray thee let it serve for table-talk Then howsoe'er thou speak'st mong other things I shall digest it


what is Antonio here

ready so please your Grace

I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
a stony adversary an inhuman wretch
uncapable of pity void and empty
from any dram of mercy

I have heard
your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
and that no lawful means can carry me
out of his envy's reach I do oppose
my patience to his fury and am arm'd
to suffer with a quietness of spirit
the very tyranny and rage of his


he's ready at the door he comes my lord


make room and let him stand before our face
Shylock the world thinks and I think so too
that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
to the last hour of act and then tis thought
thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
than is thy strange-apparent cruelty
and where thou now exact'st the penalty
which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh
thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
but touch'd with human gentleness and love
forgive a moiety of the principal
glancing an eye of pity on his losses
that have of late so huddled on his back
enow to press a royal merchant down
and pluck commiseration of his state
from stubborn Turks and Tartars never train'd
to offices of tender courtesy
we all expect a gentle answer Jew

I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose
and by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
to have the due and forfeit of my bond
if you deny it let the danger light
upon your charter and your city's freedom
you'll ask me why I rather choose to have
a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
three thousand ducats I'll not answer that
but say it is my humour is it answer'd
what if my house be troubled with a rat
and I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats
to have it ban'd What are you answer'd yet
some men there are love not a gaping pig
some that are mad if they behold a cat
and others when the bagpipe sings i' the nose
mistress of passion sways it to the mood
of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer
as there is no firm reason to be render'd
why he cannot abide a gaping pig
why he a harmless necessary cat
why he a wauling bagpipe but of force
must yield to such inevitable shame
as to offend himself being offended
so can I give no reason nor I will not
more than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio that I follow thus
a losing suit against him Are you answer'd

this is no answer thou unfeeling man
to excuse the current of thy cruelty

I am not bound to please thee with my answer

do all men kill the things they do not love
hates any man the thing he would not kill

every offence is not a hate at first

what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice

I pray you think you question with the Jew
you may as well go stand upon the beach
and bid the main flood bate his usual height
you may as well use question with the wolf
why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
you may as well forbid the mountain pines
to wag their high tops and to make no noise
when they are fretted with the gusts of heaven
you may as well do anything most hard
as seek to soften that than which what's harder
his Jewish heart therefore I do beseech you
make no more offers use no further means
but with all brief and plain conveniency

for thy three thousand ducats here is six

if every ducat in six thousand ducats
were in six parts and every part a ducat
I would not draw them I would have my bond

how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none

what judgment shall I dread doing no wrong
you have among you many a purchas'd slave
which like your asses and your dogs and mules
you use in abject and in slavish parts
because you bought them shall I say to you
let them be free marry them to your heirs
why sweat they under burdens let their beds
be made as soft as yours and let their palates
be season'd with such viands You will answer
'The slaves are ours so do I answer you
is dearly bought tis mine and I will have it
if you deny me fie upon your law
there is no force in the decrees of Venice
I stand for judgment answer shall I have it

upon my power I may dismiss this court
unless Bellario a learned doctor
whom I have sent for to determine this
come here to-day

my lord here stays without
a messenger with letters from the doctor
new come from Padua

bring us the letters call the messenger

good cheer Antonio What man courage yet
the Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
I am a tainted wether of the flock
meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
drops earliest to the ground and so let me
you cannot better be employ'd Bassanio
than to live still and write mine epitaph


came you from Padua from Bellario

from both my lord Bellario greets your Grace


why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly

to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there

not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew
thou mak'st thy knife keen but no metal can
no not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness

no none that thou hast wit enough to make

O be thou damn'd inexecrable dog
and for thy life let justice be accus'd
thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith
to hold opinion with Pythagoras
that souls of animals infuse themselves
into the trunks of men thy currish spirit
govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter
even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
and whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam
infus'd itself in thee for thy desires
are wolfish bloody starv'd and ravenous

till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
to cureless ruin I stand here for law
this letter from Bellario doth commend
a young and learned doctor to our court
where is he

he attendeth here hard by
to know your answer whether you'll admit him

with all my heart some three or four of you
go give him courteous conduct to this place
meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter

your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome his name is Balthazar I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant we turned o'er many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Grace's request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation

you hear the learn'd Bellario what he writes
and here I take it is the doctor come

give me your hand Came you from old Bellario

I did my lord
you are welcome take your place
are you acquainted with the difference
that holds this present question in the court

I am informed throughly of the cause
which is the merchant here and which the Jew

Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth

is your name Shylock

Shylock is my name

of a strange nature is the suit you follow
yet in such rule that the Venetian law
cannot impugn you as you do proceed


you stand within his danger do you not
ay so he says

do you confess the bond

I do

then must the Jew be merciful

on what compulsion must I tell me that

the quality of mercy is not strain'd
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath it is twice bless'd
it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
the throned monarch better than his crown
his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
the attribute to awe and majesty
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
it is an attribute to God himself
and earthly power doth then show likest God's
when mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew
though justice be thy plea consider this
that in the course of justice none of us
should see salvation we do pray for mercy
and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
the deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much
to mitigate the justice of thy plea
which if thou follow this strict court of Venice
must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there

my deeds upon my head I crave the law
the penalty and forfeit of my bond

is he not able to discharge the money

yes here I tender it for him in the court
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er
on forfeit of my hands my head my heart
if this will not suffice it must appear
that malice bears down truth And I beseech you
wrest once the law to your authority
to do a great right do a little wrong
and curb this cruel devil of his will

it must not be There is no power in Venice
can alter a decree established
'Twill be recorded for a precedent
and many an error by the same example
will rush into the state It cannot be

a Daniel come to judgment yea a Daniel
O wise young judge how I do honour thee

I pray you let me look upon the bond


Shylock there's thrice thy money offer'd thee

an oath an oath I have an oath in heaven
shall I lay perjury upon my soul
no not for Venice

why this bond is forfeit
and lawfully by this the Jew may claim
a pound of flesh to be by him cut off
nearest the merchant's heart Be merciful
take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond

when it is paid according to the tenour
it doth appear you are a worthy judge
you know the law your exposition
hath been most sound I charge you by the law
whereof you are a well-deserving pillar
proceed to judgment by my soul I swear
to alter me I stay here on my bond

most heartily I do beseech the court
to give the judgment

why then thus it is
you must prepare your bosom for his knife

O noble judge O excellent young man

for the intent and purpose of the law
hath full relation to the penalty
which here appeareth due upon the bond

'Tis very true O wise and upright judge
how much more elder art thou than thy looks

therefore lay bare your bosom

so says the bond doth it not noble judge
'Nearest his heart those are the very words

it is so Are there balance here to weigh
the flesh

I have them ready

have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge
to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death

is it so nominated in the bond

it is not so express'd but what of that
'Twere good you do so much for charity

I cannot find it tis not in the bond

you merchant have you anything to say
but little I am arm'd and well prepar'd
give me your hand Bassanio fare you well
grieve not that I am fallen to this for you
for herein Fortune shows herself more kind
than is her custom it is still her use
to let the wretched man outlive his wealth
to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
an age of poverty from which lingering penance
of such a misery doth she cut me off
commend me to your honourable wife
tell her the process of Antonio's end
say how I lov'd you speak me fair in death
and when the tale is told bid her be judge
whether Bassanio had not once a love
repent not you that you shall lose your friend
and he repents not that he pays your debt
for if the Jew do cut but deep enough
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart

which is as dear to me as life itself
but life itself my wife and all the world
are not with me esteem'd above thy life
I would lose all ay sacrifice them all
here to this devil to deliver you

your wife would give you little thanks for that
if she were by to hear you make the offer

I have a wife whom I protest I love
I would she were in heaven so she could
entreat some power to change this currish Jew

'Tis well you offer it behind her back
the wish would make else an unquiet house

these be the Christian husbands I have a daughter
would any of the stock of Barabbas
had been her husband rather than a Christian

a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine
the court awards it and the law doth give it

most rightful judge

and you must cut this flesh from off his breast
the law allows it and the court awards it

most learned judge A sentence come prepare

tarry a little there is something else
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
the words expressly are a pound of flesh
then take thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
but in the cutting it if thou dost shed
one drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods
are by the laws of Venice confiscate
unto the state of Venice
O upright judge Mark Jew O learned judge

is that the law

thyself shalt see the act
for as thou urgest justice be assur'd
thou shalt have justice more than thou desir'st

O learned judge Mark Jew a learned judge

I take this offer then pay the bond thrice
and let the Christian go

here is the money

soft
the Jew shall have all justice soft no haste
he shall have nothing but the penalty


therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
but just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more
or less than a just pound be it but so much
as makes it light or heavy in the substance
or the division of the twentieth part
of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
but in the estimation of a hair
thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate

a second Daniel a Daniel Jew
now infidel I have thee on the hip

why doth the Jew pause take thy forfeiture

give me my principal and let me go

I have it ready for thee here it is
he hath refus'd it in the open court
he shall have merely justice and his bond

a Daniel still say I a second Daniel
I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word

shall I not have barely my principal

thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
to be so taken at thy peril Jew

why then the devil give him good of it
I'll stay no longer question

tarry Jew
the law hath yet another hold on you
it is enacted in the laws of Venice
if it be prov'd against an alien
that by direct or indirect attempts
the party gainst the which he doth contrive
shall seize one half his goods the other half
comes to the privy coffer of the state
and the offender's life lies in the mercy
of the duke only gainst all other voice
in which predicament I say thou stand'st
for it appears by manifest proceeding
that indirectly and directly too
thou hast contriv'd against the very life
of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd
the danger formerly by me rehears'd
down therefore and beg mercy of the duke

beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
thou hast not left the value of a cord
therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge

that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits
for half thy wealth it is Antonio's
the other half comes to the general state
which humbleness may drive into a fine

ay for the state not for Antonio

nay take my life and all pardon not that
you take my house when you do take the prop
that doth sustain my house you take my life
when you do take the means whereby I live

what mercy can you render him Antonio

a halter gratis nothing else for God's sake

so please my lord the duke and all the court
to quit the fine for one half of his goods
I am content so he will let me have
the other half in use to render it
that lately stole his daughter
two things provided more that for this favour
he presently become a Christian
the other that he do record a gift
here in the court of all he dies possess'd
unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter

he shall do this or else I do recant
the pardon that I late pronounced here

art thou contented Jew what dost thou say

I am content

clerk draw a deed of gift

I pray you give me leave to go from hence
I am not well Send the deed after me
and I will sign it
get thee gone but do it

in christening thou shalt have two godfathers
had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
to bring thee to the gallows not the font


sir I entreat you home with me to dinner

I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon
I must away this night toward Padua
and it is meet I presently set forth

I am sorry that your leisure serves you not
Antonio gratify this gentleman
for in my mind you are much bound to him


most worthy gentleman I and my friend
of grievous penalties in lieu whereof
three thousand ducats due unto the Jew
we freely cope your courteous pains withal

and stand indebted over and above
in love and service to you evermore

he is well paid that is well satisfied
and I delivering you am satisfied
and therein do account myself well paid
my mind was never yet more mercenary
I pray you know me when we meet again
I wish you well and so I take my leave

dear sir of force I must attempt you further
take some remembrance of us as a tribute
not as a fee Grant me two things I pray you
not to deny me and to pardon me



give me your gloves I'll wear them for your sake


and for your love I'll take this ring from you
do not draw back your hand I'll take no more
and you in love shall not deny me this

this ring good sir alas it is a trifle
I will not shame myself to give you this

I will have nothing else but only this
and now methinks I have a mind to it

there's more depends on this than on the value
the dearest ring in Venice will I give you
and find it out by proclamation
only for this I pray you pardon me
I see sir you are liberal in offers
you taught me first to beg and now methinks
you teach me how a beggar should be answer'd

good sir this ring was given me by my wife
and when she put it on she made me vow
that I should never sell nor give nor lose it

that scuse serves many men to save their gifts
an if your wife be not a mad-woman
and know how well I have deserv'd the ring
she would not hold out enemy for ever
for giving it to me Well peace be with you


my Lord Bassanio let him have the ring
let his deservings and my love withal
be valu'd gainst your wife's commandment

give him the ring and bring him if thou canst
unto Antonio's house Away make haste

come you and I will thither presently
and in the morning early will we both
fly toward Belmont Come Antonio


inquire the Jew's house out give him this deed
and let him sign it We'll away to-night
and be a day before our husbands home
this deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo


fair sir you are well o'erta'en
my Lord Bassanio upon more advice
hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat
your company at dinner

his ring I do accept most thankfully
and so I pray you tell him furthermore
I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house

that will I do

sir I would speak with you


I'll see if I can get my husband's ring
which I did make him swear to keep for ever

thou mayst I warrant We shall have old swearing
that they did give the rings away to men
but we'll outface them and outswear them too
away make haste thou know'st where I will tarry

come good sir will you show me to this house

when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
and they did make no noise in such a night
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
and sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents
where Cressid lay that night

in such a night
did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
and saw the lion's shadow ere himself
and ran dismay'd away

in such a night
stood Dido with a willow in her hand
upon the wild sea-banks and waft her love
to come again to Carthage

in such a night
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
that did renew old son
in such a night
did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
and with an unthrift love did run from Venice
as far as Belmont

in such a night
did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well
stealing her soul with many vows of faith
and ne'er a true one

in such a night
did pretty Jessica like a little shrew
slander her love and he forgave it her

I would out-night you did no body come
but hark I hear the footing of a man


who comes so fast in silence of the night
a friend

a friend what friend your name I pray you friend

Stephano is my name and I bring word
my mistress will before the break of day
be here at Belmont she doth stray about
by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
for happy wedlock hours

who comes with her

none but a holy hermit and her maid
I pray you is my master yet return'd

he is not nor we have not heard from him
but go we in I pray thee Jessica
and ceremoniously let us prepare
some welcome for the mistress of the house

sola sola wo ha ho sola sola

who calls

sola did you see Master Lorenzo
master Lorenzo sola sola

leave hollaing man here

sola where where

here

tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning


sweet soul let's in and there expect their coming
and yet no matter why should we go in
within the house your mistress is at hand
and bring your music forth into the air

how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
here will we sit and let the sounds of music
creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
become the touches of sweet harmony
sit Jessica look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
there's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
but in his motion like an angel sings
still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins
such harmony is in immortal souls
but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it

come ho and wake Diana with a hymn
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear
and draw her home with music

I am never merry when I hear sweet music

the reason is your spirits are attentive
for do but note a wild and wanton herd
or race of youthful and unhandled colts
fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
which is the hot condition of their blood
if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
or any air of music touch their ears
you shall perceive them make a mutual stand
their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
by the sweet power of music therefore the poet
did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods
since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
but music for the time doth change his nature
the man that hath no music in himself
nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds
is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
and his affections dark as Erebus
let no such man be trusted Mark the music


that light we see is burning in my hall
how far that little candle throws his beams
so shines a good deed in a naughty world

when the moon shone we did not see the candle

so doth the greater glory dim the less
a substitute shines brightly as a king
until a king be by and then his state
empties itself as doth an inland brook
into the main of waters Music hark

it is your music madam of the house

nothing is good I see without respect

silence bestows that virtue on it madam

the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
when neither is attended and I think
the nightingale if she should sing by day
when every goose is cackling would be thought
no better a musician than the wren
how many things by season season'd are
to their right praise and true perfection
peace ho the moon sleeps with Endymion
and would not be awak'd


that is the voice
or I am much deceiv'd of Portia

he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
by the bad voice
dear lady welcome home

we have been praying for our husbands' welfare
which speed we hope the better for our words
are they return'd

madam they are not yet
but there is come a messenger before
to signify their coming

go in Nerissa
give order to my servants that they take
no note at all of our being absent hence
nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you


your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet
we are no tell-tales madam fear you not

it looks a little paler tis a day
such as the day is when the sun is hid


we should hold day with the Antipodes
if you would walk in absence of the sun

let me give light but let me not be light
for a light wife doth make a heavy husband
and never be Bassanio so for me
but God sort all You are welcome home my lord

I thank you madam Give welcome to my friend
this is the man this is Antonio
to whom I am so infinitely bound

you should in all sense be much bound to him
for as I hear he was much bound for you


sir you are very welcome to our house
it must appear in other ways than words
therefore I scant this breathing courtesy

by yonder moon I swear you do me wrong
in faith I gave it to the judge's clerk
would he were gelt that had it for my part
since you do take it love so much at heart

a quarrel ho already what's the matter

about a hoop of gold a paltry ring
that she did give me whose poesy was
for all the world like cutlers' poetry
upon a knife Love me and leave me not

what talk you of the posy or the value
you swore to me when I did give it you
and that it should lie with you in your grave
though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
you should have been respective and have kept it
gave it a judge's clerk no God's my judge
the clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it

he will an if he live to be a man

ay if a woman live to be a man

now by this hand I gave it to a youth
a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
no higher than thyself the judge's clerk
a prating boy that begg'd it as a fee
I could not for my heart deny it him

you were to blame I must be plain with you
to part so slightly with your wife's first gift
a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
never to part with it and here he stands
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
that the world masters Now in faith Gratiano
you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
an twere to me I should be mad at it

why I were best to cut my left hand off
and swear I lost the ring defending it

my Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
deserv'd it too and then the boy his clerk
that took some pains in writing he begg'd mine
and neither man nor master would take aught
but the two rings

what ring gave you my lord

if I could add a lie unto a fault
I would deny it but you see my finger
hath not the ring upon it it is gone

even so void is your false heart of truth
by heaven I will ne'er come in your bed
until I see the ring

nor I in yours
till I again see mine

sweet Portia
if you did know to whom I gave the ring
if you did know for whom I gave the ring
and would conceive for what I gave the ring
and how unwillingly I left the ring
when naught would be accepted but the ring
you would abate the strength of your displeasure
if you had known the virtue of the ring
or half her worthiness that gave the ring
or your own honour to contain the ring
you would not then have parted with the ring
what man is there so much unreasonable
if you had pleas'd to have defended it
with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
to urge the thing held as a ceremony
Nerissa teaches me what to believe
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring

no by my honour madam by my soul
no woman had it but a civil doctor
which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
and begg'd the ring the which I did deny him
and suffer'd him to go displeas'd away
even he that did uphold the very life
of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady
I was enforc'd to send it after him
my honour would not let ingratitude
so much besmear it Pardon me good lady
for by these blessed candles of the night
had you been there I think you would have begg'd
the ring of me to give the worthy doctor

let not that doctor e'er come near my house
since he hath got the jewel that I lov'd
and that which you did swear to keep for me
I will become as liberal as you
I'll not deny him anything I have
no not my body nor my husband's bed
know him I shall I am well sure of it
lie not a night from home watch me like Argus
if you do not if I be left alone
now by mine honour which is yet mine own
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow

and I his clerk therefore be well advis'd

well do you so let me not take him then
for if I do I'll mar the young clerk's pen

I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels

sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding

Portia forgive me this enforced wrong
and in the hearing of these many friends
I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
wherein I see myself

mark you but that
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself
in each eye one swear by your double self
and there's an oath of credit

nay but hear me
I never more will break an oath with thee

I once did lend my body for his wealth
which but for him that had your husband's ring
had quite miscarried I dare be bound again
my soul upon the forfeit that your lord
will never more break faith advisedly

then you shall be his surety Give him this
and bid him keep it better than the other

here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring

by heaven it is the same I gave the doctor

I had it of him pardon me Bassanio
for by this ring the doctor lay with me

and pardon me my gentle Gratiano
in lieu of this last night did lie with me

why this is like the mending of highways
in summer where the ways are fair enough
what are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it

speak not so grossly You are all amaz'd
here is a letter read it at your leisure
it comes from Padus from Bellario
there you shall find that Portia was the doctor
Nerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here
shall witness I set forth as soon as you
and even but now return'd I have not yet
enter'd my house Antonio you are welcome
and I have better news in store for you
than you expect unseal this letter soon
there you shall find three of your argosies
are richly come to harbour suddenly
you shall not know by what strange accident

I am dumb

were you the doctor and I knew you not

were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold

ay but the clerk that never means to do it
unless he live until he be a man

sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
when I am absent then lie with my wife

sweet lady you have given me life and living
for here I read for certain that my ships
are safely come to road

how now Lorenzo
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you
ay and I'll give them him without a fee
there do I give to you and Jessica
from the rich Jew a special deed of gift
after his death of all he dies possess'd of

fair ladies you drop manna in the way
of starved people

it is almost morning
and yet I am sure you are not satisfied
of these events at full Let us go in
and charge us there upon inter'gatories
and we will answer all things faithfully

let it be so the first inter'gatory
that my Nerissa shall be sworn on is
whe'r till the next night she had rather stay
or go to bed now being two hours to day
but were the day come I should wish it dark
well while I live I'll fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring

I have spoke let him follow
let me see thee forth and lime I am at a word follow


Bardolph follow him A tapster is a good trade an old cloak makes a new jerkin a withered serving-man a fresh tapster Go adieu

it is a life that I have desired I will thrive

O base Hungarian wight wilt thou the spigot wield


he was gotten in drink is not the humour conceited

I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox his thefts were too open his filching was like an unskilful singer he kept not time

the good humour is to steal at a minim's rest

'Convey the wise it call Steal foh a fico for the phrase

well sirs I am almost out at heels
why then let kibes ensue

there is no remedy I must conycatch I must shift

young ravens must have food

which of you know Ford of this town

I ken the wight he is of substance good

my honest lads I will tell you what I am about

two yards and more

no quips now Pistol Indeed I am in the waist two yards about but I am now about no waste I am about thrift Briefly I do mean to make love to Ford's wife I spy entertainment in her she discourses she carves she gives the leer of invitation I can construe the action of her familiar style and the hardest voice of her behaviour to be Englished rightly is I am Sir John Falstaff's

he hath studied her well and translated her well out of honesty into English

the anchor is deep will that humour pass
now the report goes she has all the rule of her husband's purse he hath a legion of angels

as many devils entertain and To her boy say I

the humour rises it is good humour me the angels

I have writ me here a letter to her and here another to Page's wife who even now gave me good eyes too examined my parts with most judicious illiades sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot sometimes my portly belly

then did the sun on dunghill shine

I thank thee for that humour

O she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a greedy intention that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass Here's another letter to her she bears the purse too she is a region in Guiana all gold and bounty I will be cheator to them both and they shall be exchequers to me they shall be my East and West Indies and I will trade to them both Go bear thou this letter to Mistress Page and thou this to Mistress Ford We will thrive lads we will thrive

shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become
and by my side wear steel then Lucifer take all

I will run no base humour here take the humour-letter I will keep the haviour of reputation

sail like my pinnace to these golden shores
rogues hence avaunt vanish like hailstones go
trudge plod away o'the hoof seek shelter pack
Falstaff will learn the humour of this age
French thrift you rogues myself and skirted page


let vultures gripe thy guts for gourd and fullam holds
and high and low beguile the rich and poor
tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack
base Phrygian Turk

I have operations in my head which be humours of revenge

wilt thou revenge

by welkin and her star

with wit or steel
with both the humours I
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page


and I to Ford shall eke unfold
how Falstaff varlet vile
his dove will prove his gold will hold
and his soft couch defile


my humour shall not cool I will incense Page to deal with poison I will possess him with yellowness for the revolt of mine is dangerous that is my true humour

thou art the Mars of malcontents I second thee troop on


what John Rugby

I pray thee go to the casement and see if you can see my master Master Doctor Caius coming if he do i' faith and find anybody in the house here will be an old abusing of God's patience and the king's English


go and we'll have a posset for't soon at night in faith at the latter end of a sea-coal fire

an honest willing kind fellow as ever servant shall come in house withal and I warrant you no tell-tale nor no breed-bate his worst fault is that he is given to prayer he is something peevish that way but nobody but has his fault but let that pass Peter Simple you say your name is

ay for fault of a better

and Master Slender's your master

ay forsooth

does he not wear a great round beard like a glover's paring-knife

no forsooth he hath but a little wheyface with a little yellow beard a cane-coloured beard

a softly-sprighted man is he not

ay forsooth but he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head he hath fought with a warrener

yes marry have I what of that

well thereby hangs a tale Good faith it is such another Nan but I detest an honest maid as ever broke bread we had an hour's talk of that wart I shall never laugh but in that maid's company but indeed she is given too much to allicholy and musing But for you well go to

well I shall see her to-day Hold there's money for thee let me have thy voice in my behalf if thou seest her before me commend me

will I i' faith that we will and I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence and of other wooers

well farewell I am in great haste now

farewell to your worship

truly an honest gentleman but Anne loves him not for I know Anne's mind as well as another does Out upon't what have I forgot

what have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty and am I now a subject for them Let me see
ask me no reason why I love you for though Love use Reason for his physician he admits him not for his counsellor You are not young no more am I go to then there's sympathy you are merry so am I ha ha then there's more sympathy you love sack and so do I would you desire better sympathy Let it suffice thee Mistress Page at the least if the love of a soldier can suffice that I love thee I will not say pity me tis not a soldier-like phrase but I say love me By me

thine own true knight
by day or night
or any kind of light
with all his might
for thee to fight

what a Herod of Jewry is this O wicked wicked world one that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show himself a young gallant What an unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard picked with the devil's name out of my conversation that he dares in this manner assay me Why he hath not been thrice in my company What should I say to him I was then frugal of my mirth heaven forgive me Why I'll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men How shall I be revenged on him for revenged I will be as sure as his guts are made of puddings


mistress Page trust me I was going to your house

and trust me I was coming to you You look very ill

nay I'll ne'er believe that I have to show to the contrary

faith but you do in my mind


what's the matter woman

O woman if it were not for one trifling respect I could come to such honour

hang the trifle woman take the honour What is it dispense with trifles what is it

if I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so I could be knighted

what thou liest Sir Alice Ford These knights will hack and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry

we burn daylight here read read perceive how I might be knighted I shall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make difference of men's liking and yet he would not swear praised women's modesty and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of Green Sleeves What tempest I trow threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his belly ashore at Windsor How shall I be revenged on him I think the best way were to entertain him with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease Did you ever hear the like

letter for letter but that the name of Page and Ford differs To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions here's the twin brother of thy letter but let thine inherit first for I protest mine never shall I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters writ with blank space for different names sure more and these are of the second edition He will print them out of doubt for he cares not what he puts into the press when he would put us two I had rather be a grantess and lie under Mount Pelion Well I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man

why this is the very same the very hand the very words What doth he think of us

nay I know not it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty I'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal for sure unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury


so will I if he come under my hatches I'll never to sea again Let's be revenged on him let's appoint him a meeting give him a show of comfort in his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter

nay I will consent to act any villany against him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty O that my husband saw this letter it would give eternal food to his jealousy

why look where he comes and my good man too he's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance

you are the happier woman

let's consult together against this greasy knight Come hither

well I hope it be not so

hope is a curtal dog in some affairs
sir John affects thy wife

why sir my wife is not young

he woos both high and low both rich and poor
he loves the galimaufry Ford perpend

love my wife

with liver burning hot prevent or go thou
like Sir Act on he with Ringwood at thy heels
O odious is the name

what name sir

the horn I say Farewell
take heed have open eye for thieves do foot by night
take heed ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing
away sir Corporal Nym
believe it Page he speaks sense


I will be patient I will find out this



'The humour of it quoth'a here's a fellow frights humour out of his wits

I will seek out Falstaff

I never heard such a drawling affecting rogue

if I do find it well

I will not believe such a Cataian though the priest o' the town commended him for a true man

'Twas a good sensible fellow well

how now Meg

whither go you George Hark you

how now sweet Frank why art thou melancholy
I melancholy I am not melancholy Get you home go

faith thou hast some crotchets in thy head now Will you go Mistress Page

have with you You'll come to dinner George

look who comes yonder she shall be our messenger to this paltry knight

trust me I thought on her she'll fit it


you are come to see my daughter Anne

ay forsooth and I pray how does good Mistress Anne

go in with us and see we'd have an hour's talk with you


how now Master Ford
you heard what this knave told me did you not

yes and you heard what the other told me

do you think there is truth in them

hang em slaves I do not think the knight would offer it but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men very rogues now they be out of service

were they his men

marry were they

I like it never the better for that Does he lie at the Garter

ay marry does he If he should intend this voyage towards my wife I would turn her loose to him and what he gets more of her than sharp words let it lie on my head

I do not misdoubt my wife but I would be loth to turn them together A man may be too confident I would have nothing lie on my head I cannot be thus satisfied

look where my ranting host of the Garter comes There is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily
how now mine host

how now bully-rook thou'rt a gentleman Cavaliero-justice I say

sir John there's one Master Brook below would fain speak with you and be acquainted with you and hath sent your worship a morning's draught of sack

Brook is his name

ay sir

call him in

such Brooks are welcome to me that o'erflow such liquor Ah ha Mistress Ford and Mistress Page have I encompassed you go to via

bless your sir

and you sir would you speak with me

I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you

you're welcome What's your will Give us leave drawer


sir I am a gentleman that have spent much my name is Brook

good Master Brook I desire more acquaintance of you

good Sir John I sue for yours not to charge you for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion for they say if money go before all ways do lie open

money is a good soldier sir and will on

troth and I have a bag of money here troubles me if you will help to bear it Sir John take all or half for easing me of the carriage


I will tell you sir if you will give me the hearing

speak good Master Brook I shall be glad to be your servant

sir I hear you are a scholar I will be brief with you and you have been a man long known to me though I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you I shall discover a thing to you wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection but good Sir John as you have one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded turn another into the register of your own that I may pass with a reproof the easier sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender

very well sir proceed

there is a gentlewoman in this town her husband's name is Ford

well sir

I have long loved her and I protest to you bestowed much on her followed her with a doting observance engrossed opportunities to meet her fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given largely to many to know what she would have given Briefly I have pursued her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all occasions But whatsoever I have merited either in my mind or in my means meed I am sure I have received none unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say this

love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues



never

have you importuned her to such a purpose

never

of what quality was your love then

like a fair house built upon another man's ground so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it

to what purpose have you unfolded this to me

when I have told you that I have told you all Some say that though she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her Now Sir John here is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in your place and person generally allowed for your many war-like court-like and learned preparations

O sir

believe it for you know it There is money spend it spend it spend more spend all I have only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife use your art of wooing win her to consent to you if any man may you may as soon as any


O understand my drift She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too bright to be looked against Now could I come to her with any detection in my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves I could drive her then from the ward of her purity her reputation her marriage vow and a thousand other her defences which now are too-too strongly embattled against me What say you to't Sir John

master Brook I will first make bold with your money next give me your hand and last as I am a gentleman you shall if you will enjoy Ford's wife

O good sir

I say you shall

want no money Sir John you shall want none

want no Mistress Ford Master Brook you shall want none I shall be with her I may tell you by her own appointment even as you came in to me her assistant or go-between parted from me I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth Come you to me at night you shall know how I speed

I am blest in your acquaintance Do you know Ford sir

hang him poor cuckoldly knave I know him not Yet I wrong him to call him poor they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money for the which his wife seems to me well-favoured I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer and there's my harvest-home

I would you knew Ford sir that you might avoid him if you saw him



what a damned Epicurean rascal is this My heart is ready to crack with impatience Who says this is improvident jealousy my wife hath sent to him the hour is fixed the match is made Would any man have thought this See the hell of having a false woman My bed shall be abused my coffers ransacked my reputation gnawn at and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong but stand under the adoption of abominable terms and by him that does me this wrong Terms names Amaimon sounds well Lucifer well Barbason well yet they are devils' additions the names of fiends but Cuckold Wittol Cuckold the devil himself hath not such a name Page is an ass a secure ass he will trust his wife he will not be jealous I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese an Irishman with my aqua-vit bottle or a thief to walk my ambling gelding than my wife with herself then she plots then she ruminates then she devises and what they think in their hearts they may effect they will break their hearts but they will effect God be praised for my jealousy Eleven o'clock the hour I will prevent this detect my wife be revenged on Falstaff and laugh at Page I will about it better three hours too soon than a minute too late Fie fie fie cuckold cuckold cuckold

'Have I caught my heavenly jewel Why now let me die for I have lived long enough this is the period of my ambition O this blessed hour

O sweet Sir John

mistress Ford I cannot cog I cannot prate Mistress Ford Now shall I sin in my wish I would thy husband were dead I'll speak it before the best lord I would make thee my lady

I your lady Sir John alas I should be a pitiful lady

let the court of France show me such another I see how thine eye would emulate the diamond thou hast the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the ship-tire the tire-valiant or any tire of Venetian admittance
a plain kerchief Sir John my brows become nothing else nor that well neither

by the Lord thou art a traitor to say so thou wouldst make an absolute courtier and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale I see what thou wert if Fortune thy foe were not Nature thy friend Come thou canst not hide it

believe me there's no such thing in me

what made me love thee let that persuade thee there's something extraordinary in thee Come I cannot cog and say thou art this and that like a many of these lisping hawthornbuds that come like women in men s apparel and smell like Bucklersbury in simple-time I cannot but I love thee none but thee and thou deservest it

do not betray me sir I fear you love Mistress Page

thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter-gate which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln

well heaven knows how I love you and you shall one day find it

keep in that mind I'll deserve it

nay I must tell you so you do or else I could not be in that mind

mistress Ford Mistress Ford here's Mistress Page at the door sweating and blowing and looking wildly and would needs speak with you presently
she shall not see me I will ensconce me behind the arras

pray you do so she's a very tattling woman


what's the matter how now

O Mistress Ford what have you done You're shamed you are overthrown you're undone for ever

what's the matter good Mistress Page

O well-a-day Mistress Ford having an honest man to your husband to give him such cause of suspicion

what cause of suspicion

what cause of suspicion Out upon you how am I mistook in you

why alas what's the matter


speak louder Tis not so I hope

pray heaven it be not so that you have such a man here but tis most certain your husband's coming with half Windsor at his heels to search for such a one I come before to tell you If you know yourself clear why I am glad of it but if you have a friend here convey convey him out Be not amazed call all your senses to you defend your reputation or bid farewell to your good life for ever

what shall I do There is a gentleman my dear friend and I fear not mine own shame so much as his peril I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the house

for shame never stand you had rather' and you had rather your husband's here at hand bethink you of some conveyance in the house you cannot hide him O how have you deceived me Look here is a basket if he be of any reasonable stature he may creep in here and throw foul linen upon him as if it were going to bucking or it is whiting-time send him by your two men to Datchet-mead

he's too big to go in there What shall I do

let me see't let me see't O let me see't I'll in I'll in Follow your friend's counsel I'll in

what Sir John Falstaff Are these your letters knight

I love thee and none but thee help me away let me creep in here I'll never

gentlemen I have dreamed to-night I'll tell you my dream Here here here be my keys ascend my chambers search seek find out I'll warrant we'll unkennel the fox Let me stop this way first [Locking the door ] So now uncape

good Master Ford be contented you wrong yourself too much

true Master Page Up gentlemen you shall see sport anon follow me gentlemen



by gar tis no de fashion of France it is not jealous in France

nay follow him gentlemen see the issue of his search


is there not a double excellency in this

I know not which pleases me better that my husband is deceived or Sir John

what a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket

I am half afraid he will have need of washing so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit

hang him dishonest rascal I would all of the same strain were in the same distress

I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff's being here for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now

I will lay a plot to try that and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine
shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress Quickly to him and excuse his throwing into the water and give him another hope to betray him to another punishment

we will do it let him be sent for to-morrow eight o'clock to have amends


I cannot find him may be the knave bragged of that he could not compass

heard you that

ay ay peace You use me well Master Ford do you

ay I do so

heaven make you better than your thoughts

my riots past my wild societies
and tells me tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property

may be he tells you true

no heaven so speed me in my time to come
albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
was the first motive that I woo'd thee Anne
yet wooing thee I found thee of more value
than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags
and tis the very riches of thyself
that now I aim at

gentle Master Fenton
yet seek my father's love still seek it sir
if opportunity and humblest suit

break their talk Mistress Quickly my kinsman shall speak for himself

'Till then farewell sir she must needs go in
her father will be angry

this is my doing now Nay said I will you cast away your child on a fool and a physician Look on Master Fenton This is my doing

I thank thee and I pray thee once to-night
give my sweet Nan this ring There's for thy pains

a kind heart he hath a woman would run through fire and water for such a kind heart But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne or I would Master Slender had her or in sooth I would Master Fenton had her I will do what I can for them all three for so I have promised and I'll be as good as my word but speciously for Master Fenton Well I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses what a beast am I to slack it


Bardolph I say

here sir

go fetch me a quart of sack put a toast in't

have I lived to be carried in a basket and to be thrown in the Thames like a barrow of butcher's offal Well if I be served such another trick I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered and give them to a dog for a new year's gift The rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies fifteen i' the litter and you may know by my size that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking if the bottom were as deep as hell I should down I had been drowned but that the shore was shelvy and shallow a death that I abhor for the water swells a man and what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled I should have been a mountain of mummy


here's Mistress Quickly sir to speak with you

come let me pour in some sack to the Thames water for my belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins Call her in

come in woman

by your leave I cry you mercy give your worship good morrow

take away these chalices Go brew me a pottle of sack finely

with eggs sir

simple of itself I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage

how now

marry sir I come to your worship from Mistress Ford

mistress Ford I have had ford enough I was thrown into the ford I have my belly full of ford

alas the day good heart that was not her fault she does so take on with her men they mistook their erection

so did I mine to build upon a foolish woman's promise


well I will visit her tell her so and bid her think what a man is let her consider his frailty and then judge of my merit

I will tell her

do so Between nine and ten sayest thou

eight and nine sir

well be gone I will not miss her

peace be with you sir


I marvel I hear not of Master Brook he sent me word to stay within I like his money well O here he comes


bless you sir


that indeed Sir John is my business

master Brook I will not lie to you I was at her house the hour she appointed me

and how sped you sir

very ill-favouredly Master Brook

how so sir did she change her determination

no Master Brook but the peaking cornuto her husband Master Brook dwelling in a continual larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embraced kissed protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife's love

what while you were there

while I was there

and did he search for you and could not find you


a buck-basket

by the Lord a buck-basket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that Master Brook there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril

and how long lay you there

nay you shall hear Master Brook what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good Being thus crammed in the basket a couple of Ford's knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but Fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand Well on went he for a search and away went I for foul clothes But mark the sequel Master Brook I suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable-fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that a man of my kidney think of that that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation And in the height of this bath when I was more than half stewed in grease like a Dutch dish to be thrown into the Thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horse-shoe think of that hissing hot think of that Master Brook

in good sadness sir I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all this My suit then is desperate you'll undertake her no more

master Brook I will be thrown into Etna as I have been into Thames ere I will leave her thus Her husband is this morning gone a-birding I have received from her another embassy of meeting twixt eight and nine is the hour Master Brook

'Tis past eight already sir

is it I will then address me to my appointment Come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall know how I speed and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her adieu You shall have her Master Brook Master Brook you shall cuckold Ford


hum ha is this a vision is this a dream do I sleep Master Ford awake awake Master Ford there's a hole made in your best coat Master Ford This tis to be married this tis to have linen and buck-baskets Well I will proclaim myself what I am I will now take the lecher he is at my house he cannot scape me tis impossible he should he cannot creep into a half-penny purse nor into a pepper-box but lest the devil that guides him should aid him I will search impossible places Though what I am I cannot avoid yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame if I have horns to make me mad let the proverb go with me I'll be horn-mad
is he at Master Ford's already thinkest thou

sure he is by this or will be presently but truly he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the water Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly

I'll be with her by and by I'll but bring my young man here to school Look where his master comes tis a playing-day I see

adieu good Sir Hugh

get you home boy Come we stay too long



he's a-birding sweet Sir John

what ho gossip Ford what ho

step into the chamber Sir John

how now sweetheart who's at home besides yourself

why none but mine own people

indeed

no certainly

speak louder

truly I am so glad you have nobody here


why woman your husband is in his old lunes again he so takes on yonder with my husband so rails against all married mankind so curses all Eve's daughters of what complexion soever and so buffets himself on the forehead crying Peer out peer out that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness civility and patience to this his distemper he is in now I am glad the fat knight is not here

why does he talk of him

of none but him and swears he was carried out the last time he searched for him in a basket protests to my husband he is now here and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport to make another experiment of his suspicion But I am glad the knight is not here now he shall see his own foolery

how near is he Mistress Page

hard by at street end he will be here anon

I am undone the knight is here

why then you are utterly shamed and he's but a dead man What a woman are you Away with him away with him better shame than murder

which way should he go how should I bestow him Shall I put him into the basket again


no I'll come no more i' the basket May I not go out ere he come
alas three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door with pistols that none shall issue out otherwise you might slip away ere he came But what make you here

what shall I do I'll creep up into the chimney

there they always use to discharge their birding-pieces

creep into the kiln-hole

where is it

he will seek there on my word Neither press coffer chest trunk well vault but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places and goes to them by his note there is no hiding you in the house

I'll go out then

if you go out in your own semblance you die Sir John Unless you go out disguised

how might we disguise him

alas the day I know not There is no woman's gown big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat a muffler and a kerchief and so escape
good hearts devise something any extremity rather than a mischief

my maid's aunt the fat woman of Brainford has a gown above

on my word it will serve him she's as big as he is and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler too Run up Sir John

go go sweet Sir John Mistress Page and I will look some linen for your head

quick quick we'll come dress you straight put on the gown the while


I would my husband would meet him in this shape he cannot abide the old woman of Brainford he swears she's a witch forbade her my house and hath threatened to beat her

heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards

but is my husband coming

ay in good sadness is he and talks of the basket too howsoever he hath had intelligence


nay but he'll be here presently let's go dress him like the witch of Brainford

I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket Go up I'll bring linen for him straight


hang him dishonest varlet we cannot misuse him enough
we'll leave a proof by that which we will do
wives may be merry and yet honest too
we do not act that often jest and laugh
'Tis old but true Still swine eats all the draff

go sirs take the basket again on your shoulders your master is hard at door if he bid you set it down obey him Quickly dispatch


come come take it up

pray heaven it be not full of knight again



ay but if it prove true Master Page have you any way then to unfool me again Set down the basket villains Somebody call my wife Youth in a basket O you panderly rascals there's a knot a ging a pack a conspiracy against me now shall the devil be shamed What wife I say Come come forth Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching

why this passes Master Ford you are not to go loose any longer you must be pinioned

why this is lunatics this is mad as a mad dog

indeed Master Ford this is not well indeed

so say I too sir

come hither Mistress Ford the honest woman the modest wife the virtuous creature that hath the jealous fool to her husband I suspect without cause mistress do I

heaven by my witness you do if you suspect me in any dishonesty

well said brazen-face hold it out Come forth sirrah



are you not ashamed let the clothes alone

I shall find you anon

'Tis unreasonable Will you take up your wife's clothes Come away

empty the basket I say

why man why

master Page as I am an honest man there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket why may not he be there again In my house I am sure he is my intelligence is true my jealousy is reasonable Pluck me out all the linen

if you find a man there he shall die a flea's death

here's no man

by my fidelity this is not well Master Ford this wrongs you


well he's not here I seek for

no nor nowhere else but in your brain


help to search my house this one time if I find not what I seek show no colour for my extremity let me for ever be your table-sport let them say of me As jealous as Ford that searched a hollow walnut for his wife's leman Satisfy me once more once more search with me

what ho Mistress Page come you and the old woman down my husband will come into the chamber

old woman What old woman's that

why it is my maid's aunt of Brainford

a witch a quean an old cozening quean Have I not forbid her my house She comes of errands does she We are simple men we do not know what's brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling She works by charms by spells by the figure and such daubery as this is beyond our element we know nothing Come down you witch you hag you come down I say

nay good sweet husband good gentlemen let him not strike the old woman



I'll prat' her

out of my door you witch you rag you baggage you polecat you ronyon out out I'll conjure you I'll fortune-tell you


are you not ashamed I think you have killed the poor woman

nay he will do it Tis a goodly credit for you

hang her witch

by yea and no I think the oman is a witch indeed I like not when a oman has a great peard I spy a great peard under her muffler

will you follow gentlemen I beseech you follow see but the issue of my jealousy If I cry out thus upon no trail never trust me when I open again

let's obey his humour a little further Come gentlemen



nay by the mass that he did not he beat him most unpitifully methought

I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the altar it hath done meritorious service

what think you May we with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience pursue him with any further revenge

the spirit of wantonness is sure scared out of him if the devil have him not in fee-simple with fine and recovery he will never I think in the way of waste attempt us again

shall we tell our husbands how we have served him

yes by all means if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband's brains If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted we two will still be the ministers

I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed and methinks there would be no period to the jest should he not be publicly shamed

come to the forge with it then shape it I would not have things cool


sir the Germans desire to have three of your horses the duke himself will be to-morrow at court and they are going to meet him
what duke should that be comes so secretly I hear not of him in the court Let me speak with the gentlemen they speak English

ay sir I'll call them to you

they shall have my horses but I'll make them pay I'll sauce them they have had my house a week at command I have turned away my other guests they must come off I'll sauce them Come


'Tis one of the pest discretions of a oman as ever I did look upon

and did he send you both these letters at an instant

within a quarter of an hour

pardon me wife Henceforth do what thou wilt
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
than thee with wantonness now doth thy honour stand
in him that was of late an heretic
as firm as faith

be not as extreme in submission
as in ofrence
but let our plot go forward let our wives
yet once again to make us public sport
appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow
where we may take him and disgrace him for it

there is no better way than that they spoke of

how to send him word they'll meet him in the Park at midnight Fie fie he'll never come

you say he has been thrown into the rivers and has been grievously peaten as an old oman methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come methinks his flesh is punished he shall have no desires

so think I too

devise but how you'll use him when he comes
and let us two devise to bring him thither

there is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter
doth all the winter-time at still midnight
walk round about an oak with great ragg'd horns
and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
and makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
in a most hideous and dreadful manner
you have heard of such a spirit and well you know
the superstitious idle-headed eld
receiv'd and did deliver to our age
this tale of Herne the hunter for a truth

why yet there want not many that do fear
in deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak
but what of this

marry this is our device
that Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us
disguis'd like Herne with huge horns on his head

well let it not be doubted but he'll come
what shall be done with him what is your plot

that likewise have we thought upon and thus
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
and three or four more of their growth we'll dress
like urchins ouphs and fairies green and white
with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
and rattles in their hands Upon a sudden
as Falstaff she and I are newly met
let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
with some diffused song upon their sight
we two in great amazedness will fly
then let them all encircle him about
and fairy-like to-pinch the unclean knight
and ask him why that hour of fairy revel
in their so sacred paths he dares to tread
in shape profane

and till he tell the truth
and burn him with their tapers

the truth being known
we'll all present ourselves dis-horn the spirit
and mock him home to Windsor

the children must
be practis'd well to this or they'll ne'er do't

I will teach the children their behaviours and I will be like a jack-an-apes also to burn the knight with my taber

that will be excellent I'll go buy them vizards

my Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies
finely attired in a robe of white

that silk will I go buy

and in that time
and marry her at Eton Go send to Falstaff straight

nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
he'll tell me all his purpose Sure he'll come

fear not you that Go get us properties
and tricking for our fairies

let us about it it is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries


go Mistress Ford
send Quickly to Sir John to know his mind

I'll to the doctor he hath my good will
and none but he to marry with Nan Page
that Slender though well landed is an idiot
and him my husband best of all affects
the doctor is well money'd and his friends
though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her


what wouldst thou have boor what thick-skin speak breathe discuss brief short quick snap

marry sir I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender

there's his chamber his house his castle his standing-bed and truckle-bed tis painted about with the story of the Prodigal fresh and new Go knock and call he'll speak like an Anthropophaginian unto thee knock I say

there's an old woman a fat woman gone up into his chamber I'll be so bold as stay sir till she come down I come to speak with her indeed

ha a fat woman the knight may be robbed I'll call Bully knight Bully Sir John speak from thy lungs military art thou there it is thine host thine Ephesian calls

how now mine host

here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of thy fat woman Let her descend bully let her descend my chambers are honourable fie privacy fie


there was mine host an old fat woman even now with me but she's gone
pray you sir was't not the wise woman of Brainford

ay marry was it muscle-shell what would you with her

my Master sir Master Slender sent to her seeing her go thorough the streets to know sir whether one Nym sir that beguiled him of a chain had the chain or no

I spake with the old woman about it

and what says she I pray sir

marry she says that the very same man that beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of it

I would I could have spoken with the woman herself I had other things to have spoken with her too from him

what are they let us know

ay come quick

I may not conceal them sir
conceal them or thou diest

why sir they were nothing but about Mistress Anne Page to know if it were my master's fortune to have her or no

'Tis tis his fortune

what sir

to have her or no Go say the woman told me so

may I be bold to say so sir

ay Sir Tike who more bold

I thank your worship I shall make my master glad with these tidings


thou art clerkly thou art clerkly Sir John Was there a wise woman with thee



out alas sir cozenage mere cozenage

where be my horses speak well of them varletto

run away with the cozeners for so soon as I came beyond Eton they threw me off from behind one of them in a slough of mire and set spurs and away like three German devils three Doctor Faustuses

they are gone but to meet the duke villain Do not say they be fled Germans are honest men


where is mine host

what is the matter sir

have a care of your entertainments there is a friend of mine come to town tells me there is three cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of Readins of Maidenhead of Colebrook of horses and money I tell you for good will look you you are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stogs and tis not convenient you should be cozened Fare you well

Vere is mine host de Jarteer


I cannot tell vat is dat but it is tell-a me dat you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany by my trot dere is no duke dat de court is know to come I tell you for good vill adieu


hue and cry villain go Assist me knight I am undone Fly run hue and cry villain I am undone


I would all the world might be cozened for I have been cozened and beaten too If it should come to the ear of the court how I have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were as crest-fallen as a dried pear I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero Well if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers I would repent

now whence come you

from the two parties forsooth

the devil take one party and his dam the other and so they shall be both bestowed I have suffered more for their sakes more than the villanous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bear

and have not they suffered Yes I warrant speciously one of them Mistress Ford good heart is beaten black and blue that you cannot see a white spot about her

what tellest thou me of black and blue I was beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brainford but that my admirable dexterity of wit my counterfeiting the action of an old woman delivered me the knave constable had set me i' the stocks i' the common stocks for a witch


come up into my chamber


master Fenton talk not to me my mind is heavy I will give over all

yet hear me speak Assist me in my purpose
and as I am a gentleman I'll give thee
a hundred pound in gold more than your loss

I will hear you Master Fenton and I will at the least keep your counsel

from time to time I have acquainted you
with the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page
who mutually hath answer'd my affection
so far forth as herself might be her chooser
even to my wish I have a letter from her
of such contents as you will wonder at
the mirth whereof so larded with my matter
without the show of both wherein fat Falstaff
hath a great scare the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large

hark good mine host
to-night at Herne's oak just twixt twelve and one
must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen
the purpose why is here in which disguise
while other jests are something rank on foot
her father hath commanded her to slip
away with Slender and with him at Eton
immediately to marry she hath consented
now sir
her mother even strong against that match
and firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed
that he shall likewise shuffle her away
while other sports are tasking of their minds
and at the deanery where a priest attends
straight marry her to this her mother's plot
made promise to the doctor Now thus it rests
her father means she shall be all in white
and in that habit when Slender sees his time
to take her by the hand and bid her go
she shall go with him her mother hath intended
the better to denote her to the doctor
for they must all be mask'd and vizarded
that quaint in green she shall be loose enrob'd
with ribands pendent flaring bout her head
and when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
to pinch her by the hand and on that token
the maid hath given consent to go with him

which means she to deceive father or mother

both my good host to go along with me
and here it rests that you'll procure the vicar
to stay for me at church twixt twelve and one
and in the lawful name of marrying

well husband your device I'll to the vicar
bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest

so shall I evermore be bound to thee
besides I'll make a present recompense

prithee no more prattling go I'll hold This is the third time I hope good luck lies in odd numbers Away go They say there is divinity in odd numbers either in nativity chance or death Away

I'll provide you a chain and I'll do what I can to get you a pair of horns

away I say time wears hold up your head and mince


how now Master Brook Master Brook the matter will be known to-night or never Be you in the Park about midnight at Herne's oak and you shall see wonders

went you not to her yesterday sir as you told me you had appointed

I went to her Master Brook as you see like a poor old man but I came from her Master Brook like a poor old woman That same knave Ford her husband hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him Master Brook that ever governed frenzy I will tell you he beat me grievously in the shape of a woman for in the shape of a man Master Brook I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam because I know also life is a shuttle I am in haste go along with me I'll tell you all Master Brook Since I plucked geese played traunt and whipped top I knew not what it was to be beaten till lately Follow me I'll tell you strange things of this knave Ford on whom to-night I will be revenged and I will deliver his wife into your hand Follow Strange things in hand Master Brook Follow

come come we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we see the light of our fairies Remember son Slender my daughter

ay forsooth I have spoke with her and we have a nayword how to know one another I come to her in white and cry mum she cries budget and by that we know one another

that's good too but what needs either your mum or her budget the white will decipher her well enough It hath struck ten o'clock

the night is dark light and spirits will become it well Heaven prosper our sport No man means evil but the devil and we shall know him by his horns Let's away follow me


master Doctor my daughter is in green when you see your time take her by the hand away with her to the deanery and dispatch it quickly Go before into the Park we two must go together

I know vat I have to do Adieu

fare you well sir

my husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying my daughter but tis no matter better a little chiding than a great deal of heart break

where is Nan now and her troop of fairies and the Welsh devil Hugh
they are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak with obscured lights which at the very instant of Falstaff's and our meeting they will at once display to the night

that cannot choose but amaze him

if he be not amazed he will be mocked if he be amazed he will every way be mocked

we'll betray him finely

against such lewdsters and their lechery
those that betray them do no treachery

the hour draws on to the oak to the oak


trib trib fairies come and remember your parts Be pold I pray you follow me into the pit and when I give the watch-ords do as I pid you Come come trib trib


the Windsor bell hath struck twelve the minute draws on Now the hot-blooded gods assist me Remember Jove thou wast a bull for thy Europa love set on thy horns O powerful love that in some respects makes a beast a man in some other a man a beast You were also Jupiter a swan for the love of Leda O omnipotent love how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose A fault done first in the form of a beast O Jove a beastly fault and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl think on t Jove a foul fault When gods have hot backs what shall poor men do For me I am here a Windsor stag and the fattest I think i' the forest send me a cool rut-time Jove or who can blame me to piss my tallow Who comes here my doe

sir John art thou there my deer my male deer

my doe with the black scut Let the sky rain potatoes let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes let there come a tempest of provocation I will shelter me here


mistress Page is come with me sweetheart

divide me like a brib'd buck each a haunch I will keep my sides to myself my shoulders for the fellow of this walk and my horns I bequeath your husbands Am I a woodman ha Speak I like Herne the hunter Why now is Cupid a child of conscience he makes restitution As I am a true spirit welcome


alas what noise

heaven forgive our sins

what should this be

away away

away away

I think the devil will not have me damned lest the oil that is in me should set hell on fire he would never else cross me thus


fairies black grey green and white
you moonshine revellers and shades of night
you orphan heirs of fixed destiny
attend your office and your quality
crier Hobgoblin make the fairy oyes

elves list your names silence you airy toys
cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap
where fires thou find'st unrak'd and hearths unswept
there pinch the maids as blue as bilberry
our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery

they are fairies he that speaks to them shall die
I'll wink and couch no man their works must eye

where's Bede Go you and where you find a maid
that ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said
rein up the organs of her fantasy
sleep she as sound as careless infancy
but those that sleep and think not on their sins
pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shins

about about
search Windsor castle elves within and out
strew good luck ouphs on every sacred room
that it may stand till the perpetual doom
in state as wholesome as in state tis fit
worthy the owner and the owner it
the several chairs of order look you scour
with juice of balm and every precious flower
each fair instalment coat and several crest
with loyal blazon ever more be blest
and nightly meadow-fairies look you sing
like to the Garter's compass in a ring
more fertile-fresh than all the field to see
and Honi soit qui mal y pense write
in emerald tufts flowers purple blue and white
like sapphire pearl and rich embroidery
buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee
fairies use flowers for their charactery
away disperse But till tis one o'clock
our dance of custom round about the oak
of Herne the hunter let us not forget

pray you lock hand in hand yourselves in order set
and twenty glow-worms shall our lanthorns be
to guide our measure round about the tree
but stay I smell a man of middle-earth

heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy lest he transform me to a piece of cheese

vile worm thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth

if he be chaste the flame will back descend
and turn him to no pain but if he start
it is the flesh of a corrupted heart

a trial come

come will this wood take fire


oh oh oh

corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
about him fairies sing a scornful rime
and as you trip still pinch him to your time

fie on sinful fantasy
fie on lust and luxury
lust is but a bloody fire
kindled with unchaste desire
as thoughts do blow them higher and higher
pinch him fairies mutually
pinch him for his villany
pinch him and burn him and turn him about
till candles and star-light and moonshine be out


nay do not fly I think we have watch'd you now
will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn

I pray you come hold up the jest no higher
now good Sir John how like you Windsor wives
see you these husband do not these fair yokes
become the forest better than the town

now sir who's a cuckold now Master Brook Falstaff's a knave a cuckoldly knave here are his horns Master Brook and Master Brook he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket his cudgel and twenty pounds of money which must be paid too Master Brook his horses are arrested for it Master Brook

sir John we have had ill luck we could never meet I will never take you for my love again but I will always count you my deer


ay and an ox too both the proofs are extant

and these are not fairies I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief in despite of the teeth of all rime and reason that they were fairies See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-lent when tis upon ill employment

sir John Falstaff serve Got and leave your desires and fairies will not pinse you

well said fairy Hugh

and leave you your jealousies too I pray you

I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good English

have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it that it wants matter to prevent so gross o'er-reaching as this Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too shall I have a coxcomb of frize Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese

seese is not goot to give putter your pelly is all putter

'Seese' and putter have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm


what a hodge-pudding a bag of flax

a puffed man

old cold withered and of intolerable entrails

and one that is as slanderous as Satan

and as poor as Job

and as wicked as his wife

and given to fornications and to taverns and sack and wine and metheglins and to drinkings and swearings and starings pribbles and prabbles

well I am your theme you have the start of me I am dejected I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel Ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me use me as you will

marry sir we'll bring you to Windsor to one Master Brook that you have cozened of money to whom you should have been a pander over and above that you have suffered I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction

forgive that sum and so we'll all be friends

well here's my hand all is forgiven at last

yet be cheerful knight thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife that now laughs at thee Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter

doctors doubt that if Anne Page be my daughter she is by this Doctor Caius' wife


Whoa ho ho father Page

son how now how now son have you dispatched

dispatched I'll make the best in Gloster-shire know on t would I were hanged la else

of what son

I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page and she's a great lubberly boy if it had not been i' the church I would have swinged him or he should have swinged me If I did not think it had been Anne Page would I might never stir and tis a postmaster's boy


what need you tell me that I think so when I took a boy for a girl If I had been married to him for all he was in woman's apparel I would not have had him

why this is your own folly Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments

I went to her in white and cried mum and she cried budget as Anne and I had appointed and yet it was not Anne but a postmaster's boy

Jeshu Master Slender cannot you see put marry poys

O I am vexed at heart what shall I do

good George be not angry I knew of your purpose turned my daughter into green and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery and there married


Vere is Mistress Page By gar I am cozened I ha' married un gar on a boy un paysan by gar a boy it is not Anne Page by gar I am cozened

why did you not take her in green

ay by gar and tis a boy by gar I'll raise all Windsor

this is strange Who hath got the right Anne

my heart misgives me here comes Master Fenton

how now Master Fenton

pardon good father good my mother pardon

now mistress how chance you went not with Master Slender

why went you not with Master Doctor maid

you do amaze her hear the truth of it
you would have married her most shamefully
where there was no proportion held in love
the truth is she and I long since contracted
are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
the offence is holy that she hath committed
of disobedience or unduteous title
since therein she doth evitate and shun
a thousand irreligious cursed hours
which forced marriage would have brought upon her

stand not amaz'd here is no remedy
in love the heavens themselves do guide the state
money buys lands and wives are sold by fate

I am glad though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me that your arrow hath glanced

well what remedy Fenton heaven give thee joy
what cannot be eschew'd must be embrac'd

when night dogs run all sorts of deer are chas'd

well I will muse no further Master Fenton
heaven give you many many merry days
good husband let us every one go home
sir John and all

let it be so Sir John
to Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
for he to-night shall lie with Mistress Ford

THE TAMING OF THE SHREW


I'll pheeze you in faith

a pair of stocks you rogue

y'are a baggage the Slys are no rogues look in the chronicles we came in with Richard Conqueror Therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide Sessa

you will not pay for the glasses you have burst

no not a denier Go by Jeronimy go to thy cold bed and warm thee



third or fourth or fifth borough I'll answer him by law I'll not budge an inch boy let him come and kindly

huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds
brach Merriman the poor cur is emboss'd
and couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach
saw'st thou not boy how Silver made it good
at the hedge-corner in the coldest fault
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound

why Bellman is as good as he my lord
he cried upon it at the merest loss
and twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent
trust me I take him for the better dog

thou art a fool if Echo were as fleet
I would esteem him worth a dozen such
but sup them well and look unto them all

I will my lord

what's here one dead or drunk See doth he breathe

he breathes my lord Were he not warm'd with ale
this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly

O monstrous beast how like a swine he lies
grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
sirs I will practise on this drunken man
what think you if he were convey'd to bed
wrapp'd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers
a most delicious banquet by his bed
and brave attendants near him when he wakes
would not the beggar then forget himself

believe me lord I think he cannot choose


even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy
then take him up and manage well the jest
carry him gently to my fairest chamber
and hang it round with all my wanton pictures
balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
procure me music ready when he wakes
to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
and if he chance to speak be ready straight
and with a low submissive reverence
say What is it your honour will command
let one attend him with a silver basin
full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers
another bear the ewer the third a diaper
and say Will't please your lordship cool your hands
some one be ready with a costly suit
and ask him what apparel he will wear
another tell him of his hounds and horse
persuade him that he hath been lunatic
and when he says he is say that he dreams
for he is nothing but a mighty lord
this do and do it kindly gentle sirs
it will be pastime passing excellent
if it be husbanded with modesty

my lord I warrant you we will play our part
as he shall think by our true diligence
he is no less than what we say he is

take him up gently and to bed with him
and each one to his office when he wakes

sirrah go see what trumpet tis that sounds

belike some noble gentleman that means
travelling some journey to repose him here


an it please your honour
players that offer service to your lordship

bid them come near

now fellows you are welcome

we thank your honour

do you intend to stay with me to-night

so please your lordship to accept our duty

with all my heart This fellow I remember
since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well
I have forgot your name but sure that part
was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd
I think twas Soto that your honour means

'Tis very true thou didst it excellent
well you are come to me in happy time
the rather for I have some sport in hand
wherein your cunning can assist me much
there is a lord will hear you play to-night
but I am doubtful of your modesties
lest over-eyeing of his odd behaviour
for yet his honour never heard a play
you break into some merry passion
and so offend him for I tell you sirs
if you should smile he grows impatient

fear not my lord we can contain ourselves
were he the veriest antick in the world

go sirrah take them to the buttery
and give them friendly welcome every one

sirrah go you to Barthol'mew my page
and see him dress'd in all suits like a lady
that done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber
and call him madam do him obeisance
tell him from me as he will win my love
he bear himself with honourable action
such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies
unto their lords by them accomplished
such duty to the drunkard let him do
with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
and say What is't your honour will command
wherein your lady and your humble wife
may show her duty and make known her love
and then with kind embracements tempting kisses
and with declining head into his bosom
bid him shed tears as being overjoy'd
to see her noble lord restor'd to health
who for this seven years hath esteemed him
and if the boy have not a woman's gift
to rain a shower of commanded tears
an onion will do well for such a shift
which in a napkin being close convey'd
shall in despite enforce a watery eye
see this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst
anon I'll give thee more instructions

I know the boy will well usurp the grace
voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband
and how my men will stay themselves from laughter
when they do homage to this simple peasant
I'll in to counsel them haply my presence
may well abate the over merry spleen
which otherwise would grow into extremes


for God's sake a pot of small ale
will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack

will't please your honour taste of these conserves

what raiment will your honour wear to-day

I am Christophero Sly call not me honour nor lordship I ne'er drank sack in my life and if you give me any conserves give me conserves of beef Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear for I have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay sometime more feet than shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather

heaven cease this idle humour in your honour
O that a mighty man of such descent
of such possessions and so high esteem
should be infused with so foul a spirit

what would you make me mad Am not I Christopher Sly old Sly's son of Burtonheath by birth a pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bear-herd and now by present profession a tinker Ask Marian Hacket the fat ale-wife of Wincot if she know me not if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom What I am not bestraught here's

O this it is that makes your lady mourn

O this it is that makes your servants droop

as beaten hence by your strange lunacy
O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth
call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
and banish hence these abject lowly dreams
look how thy servants do attend on thee
each in his office ready at thy beck
wilt thou have music hark Apollo plays

and twenty caged nightingales do sing
or wilt thou sleep we'll have thee to a couch
softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
on purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis
say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground
or wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trapp'd
their harness studded all with gold and pearl
dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar
above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt
thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth
say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift
as breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe

dost thou love pictures we will fetch thee straight
adonis painted by a running brook
and Cytherea all in sedges hid
which seem to move and wanton with her breath
even as the waving sedges play with wind

we'll show thee Io as she was a maid
and how she was beguiled and surpris'd
as lively painted as the deed was done

or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood
scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds
and at that sight shall sad Apollo weep
so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn

thou art a lord and nothing but a lord
than any woman in this waning age

and till the tears that she hath shed for thee
like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face
she was the fairest creature in the world
and yet she is inferior to none

am I a lord and have I such a lady
or do I dream or have I dream'd till now
I do not sleep I see I hear I speak
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things
upon my life I am a lord indeed
and not a tinker nor Christophero Sly
well bring our lady hither to our sight
and once again a pot o' the smallest ale

will't please your mightiness to wash your hands

O how we joy to see your wit restor'd
these fifteen years you have been in a dream
or when you wak'd so wak'd as if you slept

these fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap
but did I never speak of all that time

O yes my lord but very idle words
for though you lay here in this goodly chamber
yet would you say ye were beaten out of door
and rail upon the hostess of the house
and say you would present her at the leet
because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts
sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket

ay the woman's maid of the house

why sir you know no house nor no such maid
nor no such men as you have reckon'd up
as Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece
and twenty more such names and men as these
which never were nor no man ever saw

now Lord be thanked for my good amends

amen

I thank thee thou shalt not lose by it


how fares my noble lord

marry I fare well for here is cheer enough
where is my wife

here noble lord what is thy will with her

are you my wife and will not call me husband
my men should call me lord I am your goodman
my husband and my lord my lord and husband
I am your wife in all obedience

I know it well What must I call her

madam

al'ce madam or Joan madam

madam and nothing else so lords call ladies

madam wife they say that I have dream'd
and slept above some fifteen year or more

ay and the time seems thirty unto me
being all this time abandon'd from your bed

'Tis much Servants leave me and her alone
madam undress you and come now to bed
thrice noble lord let me entreat of you
to pardon me yet for a night or two
or if not so until the sun be set
for your physicians have expressly charg'd
in peril to incur your former malady
that I should yet absent me from your bed
I hope this reason stands for my excuse

ay it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again I will therefore tarry in spite of the flesh and the blood


your honour's players hearing your amendment
are come to play a pleasant comedy
for so your doctors hold it very meet
seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood
and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
therefore they thought it good you hear a play
and frame your mind to mirth and merriment
which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
marry I will let them play it Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick

no my good lord it is more pleasing stuff

what household stuff

it is a kind of history

well we'll see't Come madam wife sit by my side
and let the world slip we shall ne'er be younger


Tranio since for the great desire I had
to see fair Padua nursery of arts
I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy
the pleasant garden of great Italy
and by my father's love and leave am arm'd
with his good will and thy good company
my trusty servant well approv'd in all
a course of learning and ingenious studies
Pisa renowned for grave citizens
gave me my being and my father first
a merchant of great traffic through the world
Vincentio come of the Bentivolii
Vincentio's son brought up in Florence
it shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd
to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds
and therefore Tranio for the time I study
virtue and that part of philosophy
will I apply that treats of happiness
by virtue specially to be achiev'd
tell me thy mind for I have Pisa left
and am to Padua come as he that leaves
a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst

mi perdonate gentle master mine
I am in all affected as yourself
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
only good master while we do admire
this virtue and this moral discipline
let's be no stoics nor no stocks I pray
or so devote to Aristotle's checks
as Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd
balk logic with acquaintance that you have
and practise rhetoric in your common talk
music and poesy use to quicken you
the mathematics and the metaphysics
fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en
in brief sir study what you most affect

gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise
if Biondello thou wert come ashore
we could at once put us in readiness
and take a lodging fit to entertain
such friends as time in Padua shall beget

master some show to welcome us to town


gentlemen importune me no further
for how I firmly am resolv'd you know
that is not to bestow my youngest daughter
before I have a husband for the elder
if either of you both love Katharina
because I know you well and love you well
leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure

to cart her rather she's too rough for me
there there Hortensio will you any wife

I pray you sir is it your will
to make a stale of me amongst these mates

mates maid how mean you that no mates for you

i' faith sir you shall never need to fear
I wis it is not half way to her heart
but if it were doubt not her care should be
to comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
and paint your face and use you like a fool

from all such devils good Lord deliver us

and me too good Lord

hush master here is some good pastime toward
that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward

but in the other's silence do I see
maid's mild behaviour and sobriety
peace Tranio

well said master mum and gaze your fill
gentlemen that I may soon make good
what I have said Bianca get you in
and let it not displease thee good Bianca
for I will love thee ne'er the less my girl

a pretty peat it is best
put finger in the eye an she knew why

sister content you in my discontent
sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe
my books and instruments shall be my company
on them to look and practise by myself

hark Tranio thou mayst hear Minerva speak

Signior Baptista will you be so strange
sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief

Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell
and make her bear the penance of her tongue

gentlemen content ye I am resolv'd
go in Bianca

and for I know she taketh most delight
in music instruments and poetry
schoolmasters will I keep within my house
fit to instruct her youth If you Hortensio
or Signior Gremio you know any such
prefer them hither for to cunning men
I will be very kind and liberal
to mine own children in good bringing up
and so farewell Katharina you may stay
for I have more to commune with Bianca


why and I trust I may go too may I not
I knew not what to take and what to leave Ha


you may go to the devil's dam your gifts are so good here's none will hold you Their love is not so great Hortensio but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out our cake's dough on both sides Farewell yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights I will wish him to her father

so will I Signior Gremio but a word I pray Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love to labour and effect one thing specially

what's that I pray

marry sir to get a husband for her sister

a husband a devil

I say a husband

I say a devil Thinkest thou Hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell

tush Gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough


faith as you say there's small choice in rotten apples But come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have to't afresh Sweet Bianca Happy man be his dole He that runs fastest gets the ring How say you Signior Gremio

I am agreed and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her Come on


I pray sir tell me is it possible
that love should of a sudden take such hold

O Tranio till I found it to be true
I never thought it possible or likely
but see while idly I stood looking on
I found the effect of love in idleness
and now in plainness do confess to thee
that art to me as secret and as dear
as Anna to the Queen of Carthage was
Tranio I burn I pine I perish Tranio
if I achieve not this young modest girl
counsel me Tranio for I know thou canst

master it is no time to chide you now
affection is not rated from the heart
if love have touch'd you nought remains but so
redime te captum quam queas minimo

gramercies lad go forward this contents
the rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound

master you look'd so longly on the maid
perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all

O yes I saw sweet beauty in her face
such as the daughter of Agenor had
that made great Jove to humble him to her hand
when with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand

saw you no more mark'd you not how her sister
began to scold and raise up such a storm

Tranio I saw her coral lips to move
and with her breath she did perfume the air
sacred and sweet was all I saw in her

nay then tis time to stir him from his trance
I pray awake sir if you love the maid
bend thoughts and wits to achieve her Thus it stands
her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
that till the father rid his hands of her
master your love must live a maid at home
and therefore has he closely mew'd her up
because she will not be annoy'd with suitors

Ah Tranio what a cruel father's he
but art thou not advis'd he took some care
to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her

ay marry am I sir and now tis plotted
I have it Tranio

master for my hand
both our inventions meet and jump in one

tell me thine first

you will be schoolmaster
and undertake the teaching of the maid
that's your device

it is may it be done

not possible for who shall bear your part
and be in Padua here Vincentio's son
keep house and ply his book welcome his friends
visit his countrymen and banquet them

basta content thee for I have it full
nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
for man or master then it follows thus
thou shalt be master Tranio in my stead
keep house and port and servants as I should
I will some other be some Florentine
some Neapolitan or meaner man of Pisa
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so Tranio at once
uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak
when Biondello comes he waits on thee
but I will charm him first to keep his tongue


so had you need
in brief then sir sith it your pleasure is
and I am tied to be obedient
for so your father charg'd me at our parting
'Be serviceable to my son quoth he
although I think twas in another sense
I am content to be Lucentio

Tranio be so because Lucentio loves
and let me be a slave to achieve that maid
whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye
here comes the rogue

sirrah where have you been

where have I been Nay how now where are you
master has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes
or you stol'n his or both pray what's the news

sirrah come hither tis no time to jest
and therefore frame your manners to the time
your fellow Tranio here to save my life
puts my apparel and my countenance on
and I for my escape have put on his
for in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried
while I make way from hence to save my life
you understand me

I sir ne'er a whit

and not a jot of Tranio in your mouth
Tranio is changed to Lucentio

the better for him would I were so too

so would I faith boy to have the next wish after
that Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter
but sirrah not for my sake but your master's I advise
you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
when I am alone why then I am Tranio
but in all places else your master Lucentio

Tranio let's go One thing more rests that thyself execute to make one among these wooers if thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty


yes by Saint Anne I do A good matter surely comes there any more of it

my lord tis but begun

'Tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady would twere done


Verona for awhile I take my leave
to see my friends in Padua but of all
my best beloved and approved friend
Hortensio and I trow this is his house
here sirrah Grumio knock I say

knock sir whom should I knock is there any man has rebused your worship

villain I say knock me here soundly

knock you here sir why sir what am I sir that I should knock you here sir
villain I say knock me at this gate
and rap me well or I'll knock your knave's pate

my master is grown quarrelsome I should knock you first
and then I know after who comes by the worst

will it not be
faith sirrah an you'll not knock I'll ring it
I'll try how you can sol fa and sing it


help masters help my master is mad

now knock when I bid you sirrah villain


how now what's the matter My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio How do you all at Verona

Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray

alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signior mio Petruchio
rise Grumio rise we will compound this quarrel

nay tis no matter sir what he leges in Latin If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir well was it fit for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught I see two-and-thirty a pip out
whom would to God I had well knock'd at first
then had not Grumio come by the worst

a senseless villain Good Hortensio
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
and could not get him for my heart to do it

knock at the gate O heavens Spake you not these words plain Sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly And come you now with knocking at the gate

sirrah be gone or talk not I advise you

Petruchio patience I am Grumio's pledge
why this's a heavy chance twixt him and you
your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio
blows you to Padua here from old Verona

such wind as scatters young men through the world
to seek their fortunes further than at home
where small experience grows But in a few
Signior Hortensio thus it stands with me
Antonio my father is deceas'd
and I have thrust myself into this maze
haply to wive and thrive as best I may
crowns in my purse I have and goods at home
and so am come abroad to see the world

Petruchio shall I then come roundly to thee
and wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife
thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel
and yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
and very rich but thou'rt too much my friend
and I'll not wish thee to her

few words suffice and therefore if thou know
one rich enough to be Petruchio's wife
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance
be she as foul as was Florentius' love
as old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
as Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse
she moves me not or not removes at least
affection's edge in me were she as rough
as are the swelling Adriatic seas
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua
if wealthily then happily in Padua

nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal

Petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in
I will continue that I broach'd in jest
I can Petruchio help thee to a wife
with wealth enough and young and beauteous
brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
is that she is intolerable curst
and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
that were my state far worser than it is
I would not wed her for a mine of gold

Hortensio peace thou know'st not gold's effect
tell me her father's name and tis enough
for I will board her though she chide as loud
as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack

her father is Baptista Minola
an affable and courteous gentleman
her name is Katharina Minola
renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue

I know her father though I know not her
and he knew my deceased father well
I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her
and therefore let me be thus bold with you
unless you will accompany me thither

I pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts O' my word an she knew him as well as I do she would think scolding would do little good upon him She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so why that's nothing an he begin once he'll rail in his ropetricks I'll tell you what sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat You know him not sir

tarry Petruchio I must go with thee
for in Baptista's keep my treasure is
he hath the jewel of my life in hold
his youngest daughter beautiful Bianca
and her withholds from me and other more
suitors to her and rivals in my love
supposing it a thing impossible
for those defects I have before rehears'd
that ever Katharina will be woo'd
therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en
that none shall have access unto Bianca
till Katharine the curst have got a husband

Katharine the curst
a title for a maid of all titles the worst
now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace
and offer me disguis'd in sober robes
to old Baptista as a schoolmaster
well seen in music to instruct Bianca
that so I may by this device at least
have leave and leisure to make love to her
and unsuspected court her by herself

here's no knavery See to beguile the old folks how the young folks lay their heads together

master master look about you who goes there ha

peace Grumio tis the rival of my love
Petruchio stand by awhile

a proper stripling and an amorous

O very well I have perus'd the note
hark you sir I'll have them very fairly bound
and see you read no other lectures to her
you understand me Over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality
I'll mend it with a largess Take your papers too
and let me have them very well perfum'd
for she is sweeter than perfume itself
to whom they go to What will you read to her

whate'er I read to her I'll plead for you
as for my patron stand you so assur'd
as firmly as yourself were still in place
yea and perhaps with more successful words
than you unless you were a scholar sir

O this learning what a thing it is

O this woodcock what an ass it is

peace sirrah
Grumio mum God save you Signior Gremio

and you're well met Signior Hortensio
trow you whither I am going To Baptista Minola
I promis'd to inquire carefully
about a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca
and by good fortune I have lighted well
on this young man for learning and behaviour
fit for her turn well read in poetry
and other books good ones I warrant ye

'Tis well and I have met a gentleman
hath promis'd me to help me to another
a fine musician to instruct our mistress
so shall I no whit be behind in duty
to fair Bianca so belov'd of me

belov'd of me and that my deeds shall prove


Gremio tis now no time to vent our love
listen to me and if you speak me fair
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either
here is a gentleman whom by chance I met
upon agreement from us to his liking
will undertake to woo curst Katharine
yea and to marry her if her dowry please

so said so done is well
Hortensio have you told him all her faults

I know she is an irksome brawling scold
if that be all masters I hear no harm

no sayst me so friend What countryman

born in Verona old Antonio's son
my father dead my fortune lives for me

O sir such a life with such a wife were strange
but if you have a stomach to't i' God's name
you shall have me assisting you in all
but will you woo this wild-cat

will I live

will he woo her ay or I'll hang her

why came I hither but to that intent
think you a little din can daunt mine ears
have I not in my time heard lions roar
have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
have I not heard great ordnance in the field
and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies
have I not in a pitched battle heard
loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets' clang
that gives not half so great a blow to hear
as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire
tush tush fear boys with bugs

for he fears none

Hortensio hark
this gentleman is happily arriv'd
my mind presumes for his own good and ours

I promis'd we would be contributors
and bear his charge of wooing whatsoe'er

and so we will provided that he win her

I would I were as sure of a good dinner


gentlemen God save you If I may be bold
to the house of Signior Baptista Minola

he that has the two fair daughters is't he you mean

even he Biondello

hark you sir you mean not her to

perhaps him and her sir what have you to do

not her that chides sir at any hand I pray

I love no chiders sir Biondello let's away

well begun Tranio

sir a word ere you go
are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no


no if without more words you will get you hence

why sir I pray are not the streets as free
for me as for you

but so is not she

for what reason I beseech you

for this reason if you'll know
that she's the choice love of Signior Gremio

that she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio

softly my masters if you be gentlemen
do me this right hear me with patience
Baptista is a noble gentleman
to whom my father is not all unknown
she may more suitors have and me for one
fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers
then well one more may fair Bianca have
and so she shall Lucentio shall make one
though Paris came in hope to speed alone

what this gentleman will out-talk us all

sir give him head I know he'll prove a jade

Hortensio to what end are all these words

sir let me be so bold as ask you
did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter

no sir but hear I do that he hath two
the one as famous for a scolding tongue
as is the other for beauteous modesty


yea leave that labour to great Hercules
and let it be more than Alcides' twelve

sir understand you this of me in sooth
the youngest daughter whom you hearken for
her father keeps from all access of suitors
and will not promise her to any man
until the elder sister first be wed
the younger then is free and not before

if it be so sir that you are the man
must stead us all and me among the rest
and if you break the ice and do this feat
achieve the elder set the younger free
for our access whose hap shall be to have her
will not so graceless be to be ingrate

sir you say well and well you do conceive
you must as we do gratify this gentleman
to whom we all rest generally beholding

sir I shall not be slack in sign whereof
please ye we may contrive this afternoon
and quaff carouses to our mistress' health
and do as adversaries do in law
strive mightily but eat and drink as friends

O excellent motion Fellows let's be gone

O excellent motion Fellows let's be gone

the motion's good indeed and be it so
Petruchio I shall be your ben venuto

good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself
to make a bondmaid and a slave of me
that I disdain but for these other gawds
yea all my raiment to my petticoat
or what you will command me will I do
so well I know my duty to my elders

of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
whom thou lov'st best see thou dissemble not

believe me sister of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
which I could fancy more than any other

minion thou liest Is't not Hortensio

if you affect him sister here I swear
I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him

O then belike you fancy riches more
you will have Gremio to keep you fair

nay then you jest and now I well perceive
you have but jested with me all this while
I prithee sister Kate untie my hands

if that be jest then all the rest was so

why how now dame whence grows this insolence
Bianca stand aside Poor girl she weeps
go ply thy needle meddle not with her
for shame thou hilding of a devilish spirit
why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee
when did she cross thee with a bitter word

her silence flouts me and I'll be reveng'd


what in my sight Bianca get thee in


she is your treasure she must have a husband
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day
and for your love to her lead apes in hell
talk not to me I will go sit and weep
till I can find occasion of revenge


was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I
but who comes here


good morrow neighbour Baptista

good morrow neighbour Gremio God save you gentlemen

and you good sir Pray have you not a daughter
call'd Katharina fair and virtuous

I have a daughter sir call'd Katharina
you are too blunt go to it orderly

you wrong me Signior Gremio give me leave
I am a gentleman of Verona sir
that hearing of her beauty and her wit
her affability and bashful modesty
her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour
am bold to show myself a forward guest
within your house to make mine eye the witness
of that report which I so oft have heard
and for an entrance to my entertainment
I do present you with a man of mine

cunning in music and the mathematics
to instruct her fully in those sciences
whereof I know she is not ignorant
accept of him or else you do me wrong
his name is Licio born in Mantua

but for my daughter Katharine this I know
she is not for your turn the more my grief

I see you do not mean to part with her
or else you like not of my company

mistake me not I speak but as I find
whence are you sir what may I call your name

Petruchio is my name Antonio's son
a man well known throughout all Italy

I know him well you are welcome for his sake

saving your tale Petruchio I pray
let us that are poor petitioners speak too
backare you are marvellous forward

O pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing
I doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing
neighbour this is a gift very grateful I am sure of it To express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar

that has been long studying at Rheims as cunning in Greek Latin and other languages as the other in music and mathematics His name is Cambio pray accept his service

a thousand thanks Signior Gremio welcome good Cambio

but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming

pardon me sir the boldness is mine own
that being a stranger in this city here
do make myself a suitor to your daughter
unto Bianca fair and virtuous
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
in the preferment of the eldest sister
this liberty is all that I request
that upon knowledge of my parentage
I may have welcome mongst the rest that woo
and free access and favour as the rest
I here bestow a simple instrument
and this small packet of Greek and Latin books
if you accept them then their worth is great

Lucentio is your name of whence I pray

of Pisa sir son to Vincentio

a mighty man of Pisa by report
I know him well you are very welcome sir


and you the set of books
you shall go see your pupils presently
holla within


sirrah lead these gentlemen
to my two daughters and then tell them both

we will go walk a little in the orchard
and then to dinner You are passing welcome

and so I pray you all to think yourselves

Signior Baptista my business asketh haste
and every day I cannot come to woo
you knew my father well and in him me
left solely heir to all his lands and goods
which I have better'd rather than decreas'd
then tell me if I get your daughter's love
what dowry shall I have with her to wife

after my death the one half of my lands
and in possession twenty thousand crowns

and for that dowry I'll assure her of
her widowhood be it that she survive me
let specialties be therefore drawn between us
that covenants may be kept on either hand

ay when the special thing is well obtain'd
that is her love for that is all in all

why that is nothing for I tell you father
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded
and where two raging fires meet together
they do consume the thing that feeds their fury
though little fire grows great with little wind
yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
so I to her and so she yields to me
for I am rough and woo not like a babe

well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words

ay to the proof as mountains are for winds


how now my friend why dost thou look so pale

for fear I promise you if I look pale

what will my daughter prove a good musician

I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
iron may hold with her but never lutes

why then thou canst not break her to the lute

why no for she hath broke the lute to me
I did but tell her she mistook her frets
and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering
when with a most impatient devilish spirit
'Frets call you these quoth she I'll fume with them
and with that word she struck me on the head
and there I stood amazed for a while
as on a pillory looking through the lute
while she did call me rascal fiddler
and twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms
as she had studied to misuse me so

now by the world it is a lusty wench
I love her ten times more than e'er I did
O how I long to have some chat with her

well go with me and be not so discomfited
proceed in practice with my younger daughter
she's apt to learn and thankful for good turns
Signior Petruchio will you go with us
or shall I send my daughter Kate to you

I pray you do I will attend her here

and woo her with some spirit when she comes
she sings as sweetly as a nightingale
say that she frown I'll say she looks as clear
as morning roses newly wash'd with dew
say she be mute and will not speak a word
then I'll commend her volubility
and say she uttereth piercing eloquence
if she do bid me pack I'll give her thanks
as though she bid me stay by her a week
if she deny to wed I'll crave the day
when I shall ask the banns and when be married
but here she comes and now Petruchio speak

good morrow Kate for that's your name I hear

well have you heard but something hard of hearing
they call me Katharine that do talk of me

you lie in faith for you are call'd plain Kate
and bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst
Kate of Kate-Hall my super-dainty Kate
for dainties are all cates and therefore Kate
take this of me Kate of my consolation
hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town
thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife

mov'd in good time let him that mov'd you hither
remove you hence I knew you at the first
you were a moveable

why what's a moveable

a joint-stool

thou hast hit it come sit on me

asses are made to bear and so are you
women are made to bear and so are you

no such jade as bear you if me you mean

alas good Kate I will not burden thee
for knowing thee to be but young and light

too light for such a swain as you to catch
and yet as heavy as my weight should be

should be should buz

well ta'en and like a buzzard

O slow-wing'd turtle shall a buzzard take thee

ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard

come come you wasp i' faith you are too angry
if I be waspish best beware my sting

my remedy is then to pluck it out

ay if the fool could find it where it lies

who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting
in his tail

in his tongue

whose tongue

yours if you talk of tails and so farewell

what with my tongue in your tail nay come again
good Kate I am a gentleman

that I'll try

I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again

so may you lose your arms
if you strike me you are no gentleman
and if no gentleman why then no arms

a herald Kate O put me in thy books

what is your crest a coxcomb

a combless cock so Kate will be my hen

no cock of mine you crow too like a craven

nay come Kate come you must not look so sour

it is my fashion when I see a crab


there is there is

then show it me

had I a glass I would

what you mean my face

well aim'd of such a young one

now by Saint George I am too young for you

yet you are wither'd

'Tis with cares

I care not


I chafe you if I tarry let me go

no not a whit I find you passing gentle
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
and now I find report a very liar
for thou art pleasant gamesome passing courteous
but slow in speech yet sweet as spring-time flowers
thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers
with gentle conference soft and affable
why does the world report that Kate doth limp
O slanderous world Kate like the hazel-twig
is straight and slender and as brown in hue
as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
O let me see thee walk thou dost not halt


did ever Dian so become a grove
as Kate this chamber with her princely gait
O be thou Dian and let her be Kate
and then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful

where did you study all this goodly speech

it is extempore from my mother-wit

a witty mother witless else her son

am I not wise

yes keep you warm

marry so I mean sweet Katharine in thy bed
and therefore setting all this chat aside
thus in plain terms your father hath consented
and will you nill you I will marry you
now Kate I am a husband for your turn
for by this light whereby I see thy beauty
thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
thou must be married to no man but me
for I am he am born to tame you Kate
and bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
conformable as other household Kates
here comes your father never make denial
I must and will have Katharine to my wife


now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter

how but well sir how but well
it were impossible I should speed amiss

why how now daughter Katharine in your dumps

you have show'd a tender fatherly regard
to wish me wed to one half lunatic
a mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out

father tis thus yourself and all the world
that talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her
if she be curst it is for policy
for she's not froward but modest as the dove
she is not hot but temperate as the morn
for patience she will prove a second Grissel
and Roman Lucrece for her chastity
and to conclude we have greed so well together
that upon Sunday is the wedding-day

I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first

hark Petruchio she says she'll see thee hang'd first


be patient gentlemen I choose her for myself
if she and I be pleas'd what's that to you
'Tis bargain'd twixt us twain being alone
that she shall still be curst in company
I tell you tis incredible to believe
how much she loves me O the kindest Kate
she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
she vied so fast protesting oath on oath
that in a twink she won me to her love
O you are novices tis a world to see
how tame when men and women are alone
a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
give me thy hand Kate I will unto Venice
to buy apparel gainst the wedding-day
provide the feast father and bid the guests
I will be sure my Katharine shall be fine

I know not what to say but give me your hands

amen say we we will be witnesses

amen say we we will be witnesses

father and wife and gentlemen adieu
I will to Venice Sunday comes apace
we will have rings and things and fine array
and kiss me Kate we will be married o' Sunday


was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly

faith gentlemen now I play a merchant's part
and venture madly on a desperate mart

'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you
'Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas


no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
but now Baptista to your younger daughter
now is the day we long have looked for
I am your neighbour and was suitor first

and I am one that love Bianca more
than words can witness or your thoughts can guess

youngling thou canst not love so dear as I

greybeard thy love doth freeze

but thine doth fry
skipper stand back tis age that nourisheth

but youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth

content you gentlemen I'll compound this strife
that can assure my daughter greatest dower
shall have my Bianca's love
say Signior Gremio what can you assure her

first as you know my house within the city
is richly furnished with plate and gold
basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands
my hangings all of Tyrian tapestry
in ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns
in cypress chests my arras counterpoints
costly apparel tents and canopies
fine linen Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl
valance of Venice gold in needle-work
pewter and brass and all things that belong
to house or housekeeping then at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail
six score fat oxen standing in my stalls
and all things answerable to this portion
myself am struck in years I must confess
if whilst I live she will be only mine

that only' came well in Sir list to me
I am my father's heir and only son
if I may have your daughter to my wife
I'll leave her houses three or four as good
within rich Pisa walls as any one
old Signior Gremio has in Padua
besides two thousand ducats by the year
of fruitful land all of which shall be her jointure
what have I pinch'd you Signior Gremio

two thousand ducats by the year of land
my land amounts not to so much in all
that she shall have besides an argosy
that now is lying in Marseilles' road
what have I chok'd you with an argosy

Gremio tis known my father hath no less
and twelve tight galleys these I will assure her
and twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next

nay I have offer'd all I have no more
and she can have no more than all I have
if you like me she shall have me and mine

why then the maid is mine from all the world
by your firm promise Gremio is out-vied

I must confess your offer is the best
and let your father make her the assurance
she is your own else you must pardon me
if you should die before him where's her dower

that's but a cavil he is old I young

and may not young men die as well as old

I am thus resolv'd On Sunday next you know
my daughter Katharine is to be married
now on the Sunday following shall Bianca
be bride to you if you make this assurance
if not to Signior Gremio
and so I take my leave and thank you both

adieu good neighbour

now I fear thee not
sirrah young gamester your father were a fool
to give thee all and in his waning age
set foot under thy table Tut a toy
an old Italian fox is not so kind my boy


a vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide
yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten
'Tis in my head to do my master good
must get a father called suppos'd Vincentio
and that's a wonder fathers commonly
do get their children but in this case of wooing
a child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning

fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir
have you so soon forgot the entertainment
her sister Katharine welcom'd you withal

but wrangling pedant this is
the patroness of heavenly harmony
then give me leave to have prerogative
and when in music we have spent an hour
your lecture shall have leisure for as much

preposterous ass that never read so far
to know the cause why music was ordain'd
was it not to refresh the mind of man
after his studies or his usual pain
and while I pause serve in your harmony

sirrah I will not bear these braves of thine

why gentlemen you do me double wrong
to strive for that which resteth in my choice
I am no breeching scholar in the schools
I'll not be tied to hours nor pointed times
but learn my lessons as I please myself
and to cut off all strife here sit we down
take you your instrument play you the whiles
his lecture will be done ere you have tun'd

you'll leave his lecture when I am in tune


that will be never tune vour instrument

where left we last
here madam

hac ibat Simois hic est Sigeia tellus
hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis


construe them

hac ibat as I told you before Simois I am Lucentio hic est son unto Vincentio of Pisa Sigeia tellus disguised thus to get your love Hic steterat and that Lucentio that comes a wooing Priami is my man Tranio regia bearing my port celsa senis that we might beguile the old pantaloon

madam my instrument's in tune

let's hear

O fie the treble jars

spit in the hole man and tune again

now let me see if I can construe it Hac ibat Simois I know you not hic est Sigeia tellus I trust you not Hic steterat Priami take heed he hear us not regia presume not celsa senis despair not
madam tis now in tune

all but the base

the base is right tis the base knave that jars
how fiery and forward our pedant is


now for my life the knave doth court my love
pedascule I'll watch you better yet

in time I may believe yet I mistrust

mistrust it not for sure acides
was Ajax call'd so from his grandfather

I must believe my master else I promise you
I should be arguing still upon that doubt
but let it rest Now Licio to you
that I have been thus pleasant with you both

you may go walk and give me leave a while
my lessons make no music in three parts

are you so formal sir

well I must wait
and watch withal for but I be deceiv'd
our fine musician groweth amorous

madam before you touch the instrument
to learn the order of my fingering
I must begin with rudiments of art
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort
more pleasant pithy and effectual
than hath been taught by any of my trade
and there it is in writing fairly drawn


yet read the gamut of Hortensio


'Gamut' I am the ground of all accord
'A re to plead Hortensio's passion
'B mi Bianca take him for thy lord
'C fa ut that loves with all affection
'D sol re one clef two notes have I
'E la mi show pity or I die

call you this gamut tut I like it not
old fashions please me best I am not so nice
to change true rules for odd inventions


mistress your father prays you leave your books
and help to dress your sister's chamber up
you know to-morrow is the wedding-day
farewell sweet masters both I must be gone


faith mistress then I have no cause to stay


but I have cause to pry into this pedant
methinks he looks as though he were in love
yet if thy thoughts Bianca be so humble
to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale
seize thee that list if once I find thee ranging
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing


Signior Lucentio this is the pointed day
that Katharine and Petruchio should be married
and yet we hear not of our son-in-law
what will be said what mockery will it be
to want the bridegroom when the priest attends
what says Lucentio to this shame of ours

no shame but mine I must forsooth be forc'd
to give my hand oppos'd against my heart
unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen
who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure
I told you I he was a frantic fool
hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour
and to be noted for a merry man
he'll woo a thousand point the day of marriage
make friends invite and proclaim the banns
yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd
now must the world point at poor Katharine
and say Lo there is mad Petruchio's wife
if it would please him come and marry her

patience good Katharine and Baptista too
upon my life Petruchio means but well
whatever fortune stays him from his word
though he be merry yet withal he's honest

would Katharine had never seen him though


go girl I cannot blame thee now to weep
for such an injury would vex a very saint
much more a shrew of thy impatient humour


master master news old news and such news as you never heard of

is it new and old too how may that be

why is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming

is he come

why no sir
what then

he is coming

when will he be here

when he stands where I am and sees you there

but say what to thine old news

why Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair of boots that have been candle-cases one buckled another laced an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town-armoury with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten near-legged before and with a half-checked bit and a head-stall of sheep's leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six times pieced and a woman's crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthread

who comes with him

O sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies' pricked in't for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey

'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion
yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd


why sir he comes not

didst thou not say he comes

who that Petruchio came

ay that Petruchio came

no sir I say his horse comes with him on his back

why that's all one


nay by Saint Jamy
I hold you a penny
a horse and a man
is more than one
and yet not many
come where be these gallants who is at home

you are welcome sir

and yet I come not well

and yet you halt not

not so well apparell'd
as I wish you were

were it better I should rush in thus
but where is Kate where is my lovely bride
how does my father Gentles methinks you frown
and wherefore gaze this goodly company
as if they saw some wondrous monument
some comet or unusual prodigy

why sir you know this is your weddingday
now sadder that you come so unprovided
fie doff this habit shame to your estate
an eye-sore to our solemn festival

and tell us what occasion of import
hath all so long detain'd you from your wife
and sent you hither so unlike yourself

tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
sufficeth I am come to keep my word
though in some part enforced to digress
which at more leisure I will so excuse
as you shall well be satisfied withal
but where is Kate I stay too long from her
the morning wears tis time we were at church

see not your bride in these unreverent robes
go to my chamber put on clothes of mine


but thus I trust you will not marry her

good sooth even thus therefore ha' done with words
to me she's married not unto my clothes
could I repair what she will wear in me
as I can change these poor accoutrements
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself
but what a fool am I to chat with you
when I should bid good morrow to my bride
and seal the title with a lovely kiss


he hath some meaning in his mad attire
we will persuade him be it possible
to put on better ere he go to church

I'll after him and see the event of this

but to her love concerneth us to add
her father's liking which to bring to pass
as I before imparted to your worship
I am to get a man whate'er he be
it skills not much we'll fit him to our turn
and he shall be Vincentio of Pisa
and make assurance here in Padua
of greater sums than I have promised
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope
and marry sweet Bianca with consent

were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly
'Twere good methinks to steal our marriage
which once perform'd let all the world say no
I'll keep mine own despite of all the world

that by degrees we mean to look into
and watch our vantage in this business
the narrow-prying father Minola
the quaint musician amorous Licio
all for my master's sake Lucentio

Signior Gremio came you from the church

as willingly as e'er I came from school

and is the bride and bridegroom coming home

a bridegroom say you Tis a groom indeed
a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find

curster than she why tis impossible

why he's a devil a devil a very fiend

why she's a devil a devil the devil's dam

I'll tell you Sir Lucentio when the priest
should ask if Katharine should be his wife
'Ay by gogs-wouns quoth he and swore so loud
that all amaz'd the priest let fall the book
and as he stoop'd again to take it up
the mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
that down fell priest and book and book and priest
'Now take them up quoth he if any list

what said the wench when he arose again

trembled and shook for why he stampt and swore
as if the vicar meant to cozen him
but after many ceremonies done
he calls for wine A health quoth he as if
he had been aboard carousing to his mates
after a storm quaff'd off the muscadel
and threw the sops all in the sexton's face
having no other reason
and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking
this done he took the bride about the neck
and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
that at the parting all the church did echo
and I seeing this came thence for very shame
and after me I know the rout is coming
such a mad marriage never was before
hark hark I hear the minstrels play

gentlemen and friends I thank you for your pains
I know you think to dine with me to-day
and have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
but so it is my haste doth call me hence
and therefore here I mean to take my leave

is't possible you will away to-night

I must away to-day before night come
make it no wonder if you knew my business
and honest company I thank you all
that have beheld me give away myself
to this most patient sweet and virtuous wife
dine with my father drink a health to me
for I must hence and farewell to you all

let us entreat you stay till after dinner

it may not be

let me entreat you

it cannot be

let me entreat you

I am content

Grumio my horse

ay sir they be ready the oats have eaten the horses

nay then
do what thou canst I will not go to-day
no nor to-morrow nor till I please myself
the door is open sir there lies your way
you may be jogging whiles your boots are green
for me I'll not be gone till I please myself
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
that take it on you at the first so roundly

O Kate content thee prithee be not angry
I will be angry what hast thou to do
father be quiet he shall stay my leisure

ay marry sir now it begins to work

gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner
I see a woman may be made a fool
if she had not a spirit to resist

they shall go forward Kate at thy command
obey the bride you that attend on her
go to the feast revel and domineer
carouse full measure to her maidenhead
be mad and merry or go hang yourselves
but for my bonny Kate she must with me
nay look not big nor stamp nor stare nor fret
I will be master of what is mine own
she is my goods my chattels she is my house
my household stuff my field my barn
and here she stands touch her whoever dare
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
that stops my way in Padua Grumio
draw forth thy weapon we're beset with thieves
rescue thy mistress if thou be a man
fear not sweet wench they shall not touch thee Kate
I'll buckler thee against a million


nay let them go a couple of quiet ones

went they not quickly I should die with laughing

of all mad matches never was the like

mistress what's your opinion of your sister

that being mad herself she's madly mated


neighbours and friends though bride and bridegroom wants
for to supply the places at the table
you know there wants no junkets at the feast
Lucentio you shall supply the bridegroom's place
and let Bianca take her sister's room

shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it

she shall Lucentio Come gentlemen let's go

fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and all foul ways Was ever man so beaten was ever man so rayed was ever man so weary I am sent before to make a fire and they are coming after to warm them Now were not I a little pot and soon hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my belly ere I should come by a fire to thaw me but I with blowing the fire shall warm myself for considering the weather a taller man than I will take cold Holla ho Curtis


who is that calls so coldly

a piece of ice if thou doubt it thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck A fire good Curtis

is my master and his wife coming Grumio
O ay Curtis ay and therefore fire fire cast on no water

is she so hot a shrew as she's reported

she was good Curtis before this frost but thou knowest winter tames man woman and beast for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself fellow Curtis

away you three-inch-fool I am no beast

am I but three inches why thy horn is a foot and so long am I at the least But wilt thou make a fire or shall I complain on thee to our mistress whose hand she being now at hand thou shalt soon feel to thy cold comfort for being slow in thy hot office

I prithee good Grumio tell me how goes the world

a cold world Curtis in every office but thine and therefore fire Do thy duty and have thy duty for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death

there's fire ready and therefore good Grumio the news

why Jack boy ho boy and as much news as thou wilt

come you are so full of cony-catching
why therefore fire for I have caught extreme cold Where's the cook is supper ready the house trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept the serving-men in their new fustian their white stockings and every officer his wedding-garment on Be the Jacks fair within the Jills fair without and carpets laid and everything in order

all ready and therefore I pray thee news

first know my horse is tired my master and mistress fallen out

how

out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a tale

let's ha't good Grumio

lend thine ear

here

there

this is to feel a tale not to hear a tale
and therefore it is called a sensible tale and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening Now I begin Imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress

both of one horse

what's that to thee

why a horse

tell thou the tale but hadst thou not crossed me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place how she was bemoiled how he left her with the horse upon her how he beat me because her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed that never prayed before how I cried how the horses ran away how her bridle was burst how I lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion and thou return unexperienced to thy grave

by this reckoning he is more shrew than she

ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home But what talk I of this Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip Walter Sugarsop and the rest let their heads be sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their garters of an indifferent knit let them curtsy with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horsetail till they kiss their hands Are they all ready

they are

call them forth

do you hear ho you must meet my master to countenance my mistress
why she hath a face of her own

who knows not that

thou it seems that callest for company to countenance her

I call them forth to credit her

why she comes to borrow nothing of them


welcome home Grumio

how now Grumio

what Grumio

fellow Grumio


welcome you how now you what you fellow you and thus much for greeting Now my spruce companions is all ready and all things neat

all things is ready How near is our master

e'en at hand alighted by this and therefore be not Cock's passion silence I hear my master


where be these knaves What no man at door
to hold my stirrup nor to take my horse
where is Nathaniel Gregory Philip

here here sir here sir

here sir here sir here sir here sir
you logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms
what no attendance no regard no duty
where is the foolish knave I sent before


you peasant swain you whoreson malt-horse drudge
did I not bid thee meet me in the park
and bring along these rascal knaves with thee

nathaniel's coat sir was not fully made
and Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel
there was no link to colour Peter's hat
and Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing
there were none fine but Adam Ralph and Gregory
the rest were ragged old and beggarly
yet as they are here are they come to meet you

go rascals go and fetch my supper in

where is the life that late I led
where are those Sit down Kate and welcome
soud soud soud soud

why when I say Nay good sweet Kate be merry
off with my boots you rogues you villains When

it was the friar of orders grey
as he forth walked on his way

out you rogue you pluck my foot awry

take that and mend the plucking off the other
be merry Kate Some water here what ho
where's my spaniel Troilus Sirrah get you hence
and bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither

one Kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with
where are my slippers Shall I have some water
come Kate and wash and welcome heartily


you whoreson villain will you let it fall
patience I pray you twas a fault unwilling

a whoreson beetle-headed flap-ear'd knave
come Kate sit down I know you have a stomach
will you give thanks sweet Kate or else shall I
what's this mutton

ay

who brought it

I 

'Tis burnt and so is all the meat
what dogs are these Where is the rascal cook
how durst you villains bring it from the dresser
and serve it thus to me that love it not

there take it to you trenchers cups and all
what do you grumble I'll be with you straight

I pray you husband be not so disquiet
the meat was well if you were so contented

I tell thee Kate twas burnt and dried away
and I expressly am forbid to touch it
for it engenders choler planteth anger
and better twere that both of us did fast
since of ourselves ourselves are choleric
than feed it with such over-roasted flesh
be patient to-morrow't shall be mended
and for this night we'll fast for company
come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber


Peter didst ever see the like

he kills her in her own humour

where is he

in her chamber making a sermon of continency to her
and rails and swears and rates that she poor soul
knows not which way to stand to look to speak
and sits as one new-risen from a dream
away away for he is coming hither

thus have I politicly begun my reign
and tis my hope to end successfully
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
and till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd
for then she never looks upon her lure
another way I have to man my haggard
to make her come and know her keeper's call
that is to watch her as we watch these kites
that bate and beat and will not be obedient
she eat no meat to-day nor none shall eat
as with the meat some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed
and here I'll fling the pillow there the bolster
this way the coverlet another way the sheets
ay and amid this hurly I intend
that all is done in reverend care of her
and in conclusion she shall watch all night
and if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
and with the clamour keep her still awake
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness
and thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour
he that knows better how to tame a shrew
now let him speak tis charity to show


is't possible friend Licio that Mistress Bianca
doth fancy any other but Lucentio
I tell you sir she bears me fair in hand

stand by and mark the manner of his teaching

now mistress profit you in what you read

what master read you first resolve me that

I read that I profess the Art to Love

and may you prove sir master of your art

while you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart


quick proceeders marry Now tell me I pray
you that durst swear that your mistress Bianca
lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio

O despiteful love unconstant womankind
I tell thee Licio this is wonderful
mistake no more I am not Licio
nor a musician as I seem to be
but one that scorns to live in this disguise
for such a one as leaves a gentleman
and makes a god of such a cullion
know sir that I am call'd Hortensio

Signior Hortensio I have often heard
of your entire affection to Bianca
and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
I will with you if you be so contented
forswear Bianca and her love for ever

see how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio
here is my hand and here I firmly vow
never to woo her more but I do forswear her
as one unworthy all the former favours
that I have fondly flatter'd her withal

never to marry with her though she would entreat
fie on her see how beastly she doth court him

would all the world but he had quite forsworn
for me that I may surely keep mine oath
I will be married to a wealthy widow
ere three days pass which hath as long lov'd me
as I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard
and so farewell Signior Lucentio
kindness in women not their beauteous looks
shall win my love and so I take my leave
in resolution as I swore before


mistress Bianca bless you with such grace
as longeth to a lover's blessed case
nay I have ta'en you napping gentle love
and have forsworn you with Hortensio


mistress we have

then we are rid of Licio

i' faith he'll have a lusty widow now That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day

God give him joy

ay and he'll tame her

he says so Tranio

faith he is gone unto the taming-school

the taming-school what is there such a place

ay mistress and Petruchio is the master
that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long


O master master I have watch'd so long
that I'm dog-weary but at last I spied
an ancient angel coming down the hill
will serve the turn

what is he Biondello

master a mercatante or a pedant
I know not what but formal in apparel
in gait and countenance surely like a father

and what of him Tranio

if he be credulous and trust my tale
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio
and give assurance to Baptista Minola
as if he were the right Vincentio

God save you sir

and you sir you are welcome
travel you far on or are you at the furthest

sir at the furthest for a week or two
but then up further and as far as Rome
and so to Tripoli if God lend me life

what countryman I pray

of Mantua

of Mantua sir marry God forbid
and come to Padua careless of your life

my life sir how I pray for that goes hard

to come to Padua Know you not the cause
your ships are stay'd at Venice and the duke
for private quarrel twixt your duke and him
hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly
'Tis marvel but that you are but newly come
you might have heard it else proclaim'd about

alas sir it is worse for me than so
for I have bills for money by exchange
from Florence and must here deliver them

well sir to do you courtesy
this will I do and this I will advise you
first tell me have you ever been at Pisa

ay sir in Pisa have I often been
Pisa renowned for grave citizens

among them know you one Vincentio
I know him not but I have heard of him
a merchant of incomparable wealth

he is my father sir and sooth to say
in countenance somewhat doth resemble you

as much as an apple doth an oyster and all one

to save your life in this extremity
this favour will I do you for his sake
and think it not the worst of all your fortunes
that you are like to Sir Vincentio
his name and credit shall you undertake
and in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd
look that you take upon you as you should
you understand me sir so shall you stay
till you have done your business in the city
if this be courtesy sir accept of it

the patron of my life and liberty

then go with me to make the matter good
this by the way I let you understand
my father is here look'd for every day
to pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here
in all these circumstances I'll instruct you
go with me to clothe you as becomes you


no no forsooth I dare not for my life

the more my wrong the more his spite appears
what did he marry me to famish me
beggars that come unto my father's door
upon entreaty have a present alms
if not elsewhere they meet with charity
but I who never knew how to entreat
am starv'd for meat giddy for lack of sleep
with oaths kept waking and with brawling fed
and that which spites me more than all these wants
he does it under name of perfect love
as who should say if I should sleep or eat
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death
I prithee go and get me some repast
I care not what so it be wholesome food

what say you to a neat's foot

'Tis passing good I prithee let me have it

I fear it is too choleric a meat
how say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd

I like it well good Grumio fetch it me

I cannot tell I fear tis choleric

a dish that I do love to feed upon

ay but the mustard is too hot a little

why then the beef and let the mustard rest

nay then I will not you shall have the mustard
or else you get no beef of Grumio

then both or one or anything thou wilt

why then the mustard without the beef

go get thee gone thou false deluding slave

that feed'st me with the very name of meat
sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
that triumph thus upon my misery


how fares my Kate What sweeting all amort

mistress what cheer

faith as cold as can be

pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me
here love thou seest how diligent I am
to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee

I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks
what not a word Nay then thou lov'st it not
and all my pains is sorted to no proof
here take away this dish

I pray you let it stand

and so shall mine before you touch the meat

I thank you sir

Signior Petruchio fie you are to blame
come Mistress Kate I'll bear you company

eat it up all Hortensio if thou lov'st me
much good do it unto thy gentle heart
Kate eat apace and now my honey love
will we return unto thy father's house
and revel it as bravely as the best
with silken coats and caps and golden rings
with ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things
with scarfs and fans and double change of bravery
with amber bracelets beads and all this knavery
what hast thou din'd The tailor stays thy leisure
to deck thy body with his ruffling treasure

come tailor let us see these ornaments
lay forth the gown


what news with you sir

here is the cap your worship did bespeak

why this was moulded on a porringer
a velvet dish fie fie tis lewd and filthy
why tis a cockle or a walnut-shell
a knack a toy a trick a baby's cap
away with it come let me have a bigger

I'll have no bigger this doth fit the time
and gentlewomen wear such caps as these

when you are gentle you shall have one too
and not till then
that will not be in haste

why sir I trust I may have leave to speak
and speak I will I am no child no babe
your betters have endur'd me say my mind
and if you cannot best you stop your ears
my tongue will tell the anger of my heart
or else my heart concealing it will break
and rather than it shall I will be free
even to the uttermost as I please in words

why thou sayst true it is a paltry cap
a custard-coffin a bauble a silken pie
I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not

love me or love me not I like the cap
and it I will have or I will have none


O mercy God what masquing stuff is here
what's this a sleeve tis like a demi-cannon
what up and down carv'd like an apple-tart
here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash
like to a censer in a barber's shop
why what i' devil's name tailor call'st thou this

I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown

you bid me make it orderly and well
according to the fashion and the time

marry and did but if you be remember'd
I did not bid you mar it to the time
go hop me over every kennel home
for you shall hop without my custom sir
I'll none of it hence make your best of it

I never saw a better-fashion'd gown
belike you mean to make a puppet of me

why true he means to make a puppet of thee

she says your worship means to make a puppet of her

O monstrous arrogance Thou liest thou thread
thou thimble
thou yard three-quarters half-yard quarter nail
thou flea thou nit thou winter-cricket thou
brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread
away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant
or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st
I tell thee I that thou hast marr'd her gown

your worship is deceiv'd the gown is made
just as my master had direction
Grumio gave order how it should be done
I gave him no order I gave him the stuff

but how did you desire it should be made

marry sir with needle and thread

but did you not request to have it cut

thou hast faced many things

I have

face not me thou hast braved many men brave not me I will neither be faced nor braved I say unto thee I bid thy master cut out the gown but I did not bid him cut it to pieces ergo thou liest

why here is the note of the fashion to testify

read it

the note lies in's throat if he say I said so
Imprimis A loose-bodied gown

master if ever I said loose-bodied gown sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread I said a gown

proceed

with a small compassed cape

I confess the cape

with a trunk sleeve

I confess two sleeves

the sleeves curiously cut

ay there's the villany

error i' the bill sir error i' the bill I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again and that I'll prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
this is true that I say an I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it

I am for thee straight take thou the bill give me thy mete-yard and spare not me

God-a-mercy Grumio then he shall have no odds

well sir in brief the gown is not for me

you are i' the right sir tis for my mistress

go take it up unto thy master's use

villain not for thy life take up my mistress' gown for thy master's use

why sir what's your conceit in that

O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for
take up my mistress' gown to his master's use
O fie fie fie
Hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid


go take it hence be gone and say no more

tailor I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow
take no unkindness of his hasty words
away I say commend me to thy master


well come my Kate we will unto your father's
even in these honest mean habiliments
our purses shall be proud our garments poor
for tis the mind that makes the body rich
and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds
so honour peereth in the meanest habit
what is the jay more precious than the lark
because his feathers are more beautiful
or is the adder better than the eel
O no good Kate neither art thou the worse
for this poor furniture and mean array
if thou account'st it shame lay it on me
and therefore frolic we will hence forthwith
to feast and sport us at thy father's house
go call my men and let us straight to him
and bring our horses unto Long-lane end
there will we mount and thither walk on foot
let's see I think tis now some seven o'clock
and well we may come there by dinner-time

I dare assure you sir tis almost two
and twill be supper-time ere you come there

it shall be seven ere I go to horse
look what I speak or do or think to do
you are still crossing it Sirs let't alone
I will not go to-day and ere I do
it shall be what o'clock I say it is
why so this gallant will command the sun


sir this is the house please it you that I call

ay what else and but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me
near twenty years ago in Genoa
where we were lodgers at the Pegasus

'Tis well and hold your own in any case
with such austerity as longeth to a father

I warrant you But sir here comes your boy
'Twere good he were school'd


fear you not him Sirrah Biondello
now do your duty throughly I advise you

tut fear not me

but hast thou done thy errand to Baptista

I told him that your father was at Venice
and that you look'd for him this day in Padua

thou'rt a tall fellow hold thee that to drink
here comes Baptista Set your countenance sir


Signior Baptista you are happily met


sir this is the gentleman I told you of
I pray you stand good father to me now

give me Bianca for my patrimony
soft son
sir by your leave having come to Padua
to gather in some debts my son Lucentio
made me acquainted with a weighty cause
of love between your daughter and himself
and for the good report I hear of you
and for the love he beareth to your daughter
and she to him to stay him not too long
I am content in a good father's care
to have him match'd and if you please to like
no worse than I upon some agreement
me shall you find ready and willing
with one consent to have her so bestow'd
for curious I cannot be with you
Signior Baptista of whom I hear so well

sir pardon me in what I have to say
your plainness and your shortness please me well
right true it is your son Lucentio here
or both dissemble deeply their affections
and therefore if you say no more than this
that like a father you will deal with him
and pass my daughter a sufficient dower
the match is made and all is done
your son shall have my daughter with consent

I thank you sir Where then do you know best
we be affied and such assurance ta'en
as shall with either part's agreement stand

not in my house Lucentio for you know
pitchers have ears and I have many servants
besides old Gremio is hearkening still
and happily we might be interrupted

then at my lodging an it like you
there doth my father lie and there this night
we'll pass the business privately and well
my boy shall fetch the scrivener presently
the worst is this that at so slender warning
you're like to have a thin and slender pittance

it likes me well Cambio hie you home
and bid Bianca make her ready straight
and if you will tell what hath happened
Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua
and how she's like to be Lucentio's wife

I pray the gods she may with all my heart

dally not with the gods but get thee gone
Signior Baptista shall I lead the way
welcome one mess is like to be your cheer
come sir we will better it in Pisa

I follow you

Cambio

what sayst thou Biondello

you saw my master wink and laugh upon you

Biondello what of that

faith nothing but he has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens

I pray thee moralize them

then thus Baptista is safe talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son

and what of him

his daughter is to be brought by you to the supper

and then
the old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command at all hours

and what of all this

I cannot tell expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum To the church take the priest clerk and some sufficient honest witnesses
if this be not that you look for I have no more to say
but bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day


hearest thou Biondello

I cannot tarry I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir and so adieu sir My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix


I may and will if she be so contented
she will be pleas'd then wherefore should I doubt
hap what hap may I'll roundly go about her
it shall go hard if Cambio go without her

come on i' God's name once more toward our father's
good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon

the moon the sun it is not moonlight now

I say it is the moon that shines so bright

I know it is the sun that shines so bright

now by my mother's son and that's myself
it shall be moon or star or what I list
or ere I journey to your father's house
go one and fetch our horses back again
evermore cross'd and cross'd nothing but cross'd

say as he says or we shall never go

forward I pray since we have come so far
and be it moon or sun or what you please
henceforth I vow it shall be so for me

I say it is the moon

I know it is the moon

nay then you lie it is the blessed sun

then God be bless'd it is the blessed sun
but sun it is not when you say it is not
and the moon changes even as your mind
what you will have it nam'd even that it is
and so it shall be so for Katharine

Petruchio go thy ways the field is won

well forward forward thus the bowl should run
and not unluckily against the bias
but soft what company is coming here

good morrow gentle mistress where away
tell me sweet Kate and tell me truly too
hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman
such war of white and red within her cheeks
what stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
as those two eyes become that heavenly face
fair lovely maid once more good day to thee

sweet Kate embrace her for her beauty's sake

a' will make the man mad to make a woman of him

young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet
whither away or where is thy abode
happy the parents of so fair a child
happier the man whom favourable stars
allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow

this is a man old wrinkled faded wither'd
and not a maiden as thou sayst he is

pardon old father my mistaking eyes
that have been so bedazzled with the sun
that everything I look on seemeth green
now I perceive thou art a reverend father
pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking

do good old grandsire and withal make known
which way thou travellest if along with us
we shall be joyful of thy company

fair sir and you my merry mistress
that with your strange encounter much amaz'd me
my name is called Vincentio my dwelling Pisa
and bound I am to Padua there to visit
a son of mine which long I have not seen


Lucentio gentle sir

happily met the happier for thy son
and now by law as well as reverend age
I may entitle thee my loving father
the sister to my wife this gentlewoman
thy son by this hath married Wonder not
nor be not griev'd she is of good esteem
her dowry wealthy and of worthy birth
beside so qualified as may beseem
the spouse of any noble gentleman
let me embrace with old Vincentio
and wander we to see thy honest son
who will of thy arrival be full joyous

but is this true or is it else your pleasure
like pleasant travellers to break a jest
upon the company you overtake
I do assure thee father so it is

come go along and see the truth hereof
for our first merriment hath made thee jealous


well Petruchio this has put me in heart
have to my widow and if she be froward
then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward

softly and swiftly sir for the priest is ready

I fly Biondello but they may chance to need thee at home therefore leave us

nay faith I'll see the church o' your back and then come back to my master as soon as I can


I marvel Cambio comes not all this while

sir here's the door this is Lucentio's house
my father's bears more toward the marketplace
thither must I and here I leave you sir

you shall not choose but drink before you go
I think I shall command your welcome here
and by all likelihood some cheer is toward


they're busy within you were best knock louder


what's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate

is Signior Lucentio within sir

he's within sir but not to be spoken withal

what if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal
keep your hundred pounds to yourself he shall need none so long as I live

nay I told you your son was well beloved in Padua Do you hear sir To leave frivolous circumstances I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him

thou liest his father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window

art thou his father

ay sir so his mother says if I may believe her

why how now gentleman why this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name

lay hands on the villain I believe a' means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance


I have seen them in the church together God send em good shipping But who is here mine old master Vincentio now we are undone and brought to nothing

come hither crack-hemp


come hither you rogue What have you forgot me

forgot you no sir I could not forget you for I never saw you before in all my life

what you notorious villain didst thou never see thy master's father Vincentio

what my old worshipful old master yes marry sir see where he looks out of the window

is't so indeed


help help help here's a madman will murder me


help son help Signior Baptista


prithee Kate let's stand aside and see the end of this controversy
sir what are you that offer to beat my servant

what am I sir nay what are you sir O immortal gods O fine villain A silken doublet a velvet hose a scarlet cloak and a copatain hat O I am undone I am undone while I play the good husband at home my son and my servant spend all at the university

how now what's the matter

what is the man lunatic

sir you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit but your words show you a madman Why sir what cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold I thank my good father I am able to maintain it

thy father O villain he is a sailmaker in Bergamo

you mistake sir you mistake sir Pray what do you think is his name

his name as if I knew not his name I have brought him up ever since he was three years old and his name is Tranio

away away mad ass his name is Lucentio and he is mine only son and heir to the lands of me Signior Vincentio

Lucentio O he hath murdered his master Lay hold on him I charge you in the duke's name O my son my son tell me thou villain where is my son Lucentio
call forth an officer

carry this mad knave to the gaol Father Baptista I charge you see that he be forthcoming

carry me to the gaol

stay officer he shall not go to prison

talk not Signior Gremio I say he shall go to prison

take heed Signior Baptista lest you be cony-catched in this business I dare swear this is the right Vincentio

swear if thou darest

nay I dare not swear it

then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio

yes I know thee to be Signior Lucentio
away with the dotard to the gaol with him

thus strangers may be haled and abused O monstrous villain


O we are spoiled and yonder he is deny him forswear him or else we are all undone

pardon sweet father

lives my sweetest son


pardon dear father

how hast thou offended
where is Lucentio

here's Lucentio
right son to the right Vincentio
while counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne

here's packing with a witness to deceive us all

where is that damned villain Tranio
that fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so

why tell me is not this my Cambio

Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio

love wrought these miracles Bianca's love
made me exchange my state with Tranio
while he did bear my countenance in the town
and happily I have arriv'd at last
unto the wished haven of my bliss
what Tranio did myself enforc'd him to
then pardon him sweet father for my sake


but do you hear sir
have you married my daughter without asking my good will

fear not Baptista we will content you go to but I will in to be revenged for this villany


and I to sound the depth of this knavery


look not pale Bianca thy father will not frown


my cake is dough but I'll in among the rest
out of hope of all but my share of the feast

husband let's follow to see the end of this ado

first kiss me Kate and we will
what in the midst of the street

what art thou ashamed of me

no sir God forbid but ashamed to kiss

why then let's home again Come sirrah let's away

nay I will give thee a kiss now pray thee love stay

is not this well Come my sweet Kate
better once than never for never too late


at last though long our jarring notes agree
and time it is when raging war is done
to smile at scapes and perils overblown
my fair Bianca bid my father welcome
while I with self-same kindness welcome thine
and thou Hortensio with thy loving widow
feast with the best and welcome to my house
my banquet is to close our stomachs up
after our great good cheer Pray you sit down
for now we sit to chat as well as eat


nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat

Padua affords this kindness son Petruchio

Padua affords nothing but what is kind

for both our sakes I would that word were true

now for my life Hortensio fears his widow

then never trust me if I be afeard

I mean Hortensio is afeard of you

he that is giddy thinks the world turns round

roundly replied

mistress how mean you that

thus I conceive by him

conceives by me How likes Hortensio that

my widow says thus she conceives her tale

very well mended Kiss him for that good widow

'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round
I pray you tell me what you meant by that

measures my husband's sorrow by his woe
and now you know my meaning

a very mean meaning

right I mean you

and I am mean indeed respecting you

to her Kate

to her widow

a hundred marks my Kate does put her down

that's my office

spoke like an officer ha' to thee lad

how likes Gremio these quick-witted folks

believe me sir they butt together well

head and butt a hasty-witted body
would say your head and butt were head and horn

ay mistress bride hath that awaken'd you

ay but not frighted me therefore I'll sleep again

nay that you shall not since you have begun
have at you for a bitter jest or two

am I your bird I mean to shift my bush
and then pursue me as you draw your bow
you are welcome all


this bird you aim'd at though you hit her not
therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd

O sir Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound
which runs himself and catches for his master

a good swift simile but something currish

'Tis well sir that you hunted for yourself
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay

O ho Petruchio Tranio hits you now

I thank thee for that gird good Tranio

confess confess hath he not hit you here

a' has a little gall'd me I confess
and as the jest did glance away from me

now in good sadness son Petruchio
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all

well I say no and therefore for assurance
let's each one send unto his wife
and he whose wife is most obedient
to come at first when he doth send for her
shall win the wager which we will propose

content What is the wager

twenty crowns

twenty crowns
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound
but twenty times so much upon my wife

a hundred then
content

a match tis done

who shall begin

that will I
go Biondello bid your mistress come to me

I go


son I will be your half Bianca comes

I'll have no halves I'll bear it all myself

how now what news

sir my mistress sends you word

how she is busy and she cannot come
is that an answer

ay and a kind one too
pray God sir your wife send you not a worse

I hope better

sirrah Biondello go and entreat my wife
to come to me forthwith


O ho entreat her
nay then she must needs come

I am afraid sir
do what you can yours will not be entreated


she says you have some goodly jest in hand
she will not come she bids you come to her

worse and worse she will not come O vile
intolerable not to be endur'd
sirrah Grumio go to your mistress say
I command her come to me


I know her answer

what

she will not

the fouler fortune mine and there an end



what is your will sir that you send for me

where is your sister and Hortensio's wife

they sit conferring by the parlour fire

go fetch them hither if they deny to come
swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
away I say and bring them hither straight


here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder

and so it is I wonder what it bodes

marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
an awful rule and right supremacy
and to be short what not that's sweet and happy
now fair befall thee good Petruchio
the wager thou hast won and I will add
unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
another dowry to another daughter
for she is chang'd as she had never been

nay I will win my wager better yet
and show more sign of her obedience
her new-built virtue and obedience
see where she comes and brings your froward wives
as prisoners to her womanly persuasion


Katharine that cap of yours becomes you not
off with that bauble throw it under foot

lord let me never have a cause to sigh
till I be brought to such a silly pass


I would your duty were as foolish too
the wisdom of your duty fair Bianca
hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time

the more fool you for laying on my duty

Katharine I charge thee tell these headstrong women
what duty they do owe their lords and husbands

come come you're mocking we will have no telling

come on I say and first begin with her

she shall not

I say she shall and first begin with her

fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
to wound thy lord thy king thy governor
it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
and in no sense is meet or amiable
a woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled
muddy ill-seeming thick bereft of beauty
and while it is so none so dry or thirsty
will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
and for thy maintenance commits his body
to painful labour both by sea and land
to watch the night in storms the day in cold
whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
and craves no other tribute at thy hands
but love fair looks and true obedience
too little payment for so great a debt
such duty as the subject owes the prince
even such a woman oweth to her husband
and not obedient to his honest will
what is she but a foul contending rebel
and graceless traitor to her loving lord
I am asham'd that women are so simple
to offer war where they should kneel for peace
or seek for rule supremacy and sway
when they are bound to serve love and obey
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
unapt to toil and trouble in the world
but that our soft conditions and our hearts
should well agree with our external parts
come come you froward and unable worms
my mind hath been as big as one of yours
my heart as great my reason haply more
to bandy word for word and frown for frown
but now I see our lances are but straws
our strength as weak our weakness past compare
that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
in token of which duty if he please
my hand is ready may it do him ease

why there's a wench Come on and kiss me Kate

well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't

'Tis a good hearing when children are toward

but a harsh hearing when women are froward

come Kate we'll to bed
we three are married but you two are sped
'Twas I won the wager

though you hit the white
and being a winner God give you good night



'Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tam'd so

THE TEMPEST

boatswain

here master what cheer

good speak to the mariners fall to't yarely or we run ourselves aground bestir bestir

heigh my hearts cheerly cheerly my hearts yare yare Take in the topsail Tend to the master's whistle Blow till thou burst thy wind if room enough


good boatswain have care Where's the master Play the men

I pray now keep below

where is the master boson
do you not hear him You mar our labour keep your cabins you do assist the storm

nay good be patient

when the sea is Hence What cares these roarers for the name of king To cabin silence trouble us not

good yet remember whom thou hast aboard

none that I more love than myself You are a counsellor if you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present we will not hand a rope more use your authority if you cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour if it so hap Cheerly good hearts Out of our way I say


I have great comfort from this fellow methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him his complexion is perfect gallows Stand fast good Fate to his hanging make the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage If he be not born to be hanged our case is miserable

down with the topmast yare lower lower Bring her to try with main-course

a plague upon this howling they are louder than the weather or our office

yet again what do you here Shall we give o'er and drown Have you a mind to sink


work you then

hang cur hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art

I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench

lay her a-hold a-hold Set her two courses off to sea again lay her off


all lost to prayers to prayers all lost


what must our mouths be cold

the king and prince at prayers let us assist them
for our case is as theirs

I am out of patience
we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards
this wide-chapp'd rascal would thou might'st lie drowning
the washing of ten tides

he'll be hang'd yet
though every drop of water swear against it
and gape at wid'st to glut him

'We split we split Farewell my wife and children
'Farewell brother We split we split we split ]

let's all sink wi' the king


let's take leave of him


now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any thing The wills above be done but I would fain die a dry death

if by your art my dearest father you have
put the wild waters in this roar allay them
the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
but that the sea mounting to th' welkin's cheek
dashes the fire out O I have suffer'd
with those that I saw suffer a brave vessel
who had no doubt some noble creatures in her
dash'd all to pieces O the cry did knock
against my very heart Poor souls they perish'd
had I been any god of power I would
have sunk the sea within the earth or e'er
it should the good ship so have swallow'd and
the fraughting souls within her

be collected
no more amazement Tell your piteous heart
there's no harm done

O woe the day
no harm
I have done nothing but in care of thee
of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
of whence I am nor that I am more better
than Prospero master of a full poor cell
and thy no greater father

more to know
did never meddle with my thoughts

'Tis time
I should inform thee further Lend thy hand
and pluck my magic garment from me So

lie there my art Wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
the direful spectacle of the wrack which touch'd
the very virtue of compassion in thee
I have with such provision in mine art
no not so much perdition as an hair
betid to any creature in the vessel
which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink Sit down
for thou must now know further

you have often
begun to tell me what I am but stopp'd
and left me to a bootless inquisition
concluding Stay not yet

the hour's now come
the very minute bids thee ope thine ear
obey and be attentive Canst thou remember
a time before we came unto this cell
I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
out three years old

certainly sir I can

of anything the image tell me that
hath kept with thy remembrance

'Tis far off
and rather like a dream than an assurance
that my remembrance warrants Had I not
four or five women once that tended me

thou hadst and more Miranda But how is it
that this lives in thy mind What seest thou else
in the dark backward and abysm of time
if thou remember'st aught ere thou cam'st here
how thou cam'st here thou may'st

but that I do not

twelve year since Miranda twelve year since
thy father was the Duke of Milan and
a prince of power
sir are not you my father

thy mother was a piece of virtue and
she said thou wast my daughter and thy father
was Duke of Milan and his only heir
a princess no worse issued

O the heavens
what foul play had we that we came from thence
or blessed was't we did

both both my girl
by foul play as thou say'st were we heav'd thence
but blessedly holp hither

O my heart bleeds
to think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to
which is from my remembrance Please you further

I pray thee mark me that a brother should
be so perfidious he whom next thyself
of all the world I lov'd and to him put
the manage of my state as at that time
through all the signiories it was the first
and Prospero the prime duke being so reputed
in dignity and for the liberal arts
without a parallel those being all my study
the government I cast upon my brother
and to my state grew stranger being transported
and rapt in secret studies Thy false uncle
dost thou attend me

sir most heedfully

being once perfected how to grant suits
how to deny them who t'advance and who
to trash for over-topping new created
the creatures that were mine I say or chang'd em
of officer and office set all hearts i' the state
to what tune pleas'd his ear that now he was
the ivy which had hid my princely trunk
and suck'd my verdure out on't Thou attend'st not

O good sir I do

I pray thee mark me
I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
to closeness and the bettering of my mind
with that which but by being so retir'd
o'erpriz'd all popular rate in my false brother
awak'd an evil nature and my trust
like a good parent did beget of him
a falsehood in its contrary as great
as my trust was which had indeed no limit
a confidence sans bound He being thus lorded
not only with what my revenue yielded
but what my power might else exact like one
made such a sinner of his memory
to credit his own lie he did believe
he was indeed the duke out o' the substitution
and executing th' outward face of royalty
with all prerogative Hence his ambition growing
dost thou hear

your tale sir would cure deafness

to have no screen between this part he play'd
and him he play'd it for he needs will be
absolute Milan Me poor man my library
was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties
he thinks me now incapable confederates
so dry he was for sway wi' the king of Naples
to give him annual tribute do him homage
subject his coronet to his crown and bend
the dukedom yet unbow'd alas poor Milan
to most ignoble stooping
O the heavens

mark his condition and the event then tell me
if this might be a brother

I should sin
to think but nobly of my grandmother
good wombs have borne bad sons

now the condition
this King of Naples being an enemy
to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit
which was that he in lieu o' the premises
of homage and I know not how much tribute
should presently extirpate me and mine
out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
with all the honours on my brother whereon
a treacherous army levied one midnight
fated to the purpose did Antonio open
the ministers for the purpose hurried thence
me and thy crying self

alack for pity
I not rememb'ring how I cried out then
will cry it o'er again it is a hint
that wrings mine eyes to t

hear a little further
and then I'll bring thee to the present business
which now's upon us without the which this story
were most impertinent

wherefore did they not
that hour destroy us

well demanded wench
my tale provokes that question Dear they durst not
so dear the love my people bore me nor set
with colours fairer painted their foul ends
in few they hurried us aboard a bark
bore us some leagues to sea where they prepar'd
a rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd
nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
instinctively have quit it there they hoist us
to cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh
to the winds whose pity sighing back again
did us but loving wrong

alack what trouble
was I then to you

O a cherubin
thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile
infused with a fortitude from heaven
when I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt
under my burden groan'd which rais'd in me
an undergoing stomach to bear up

how came we ashore

by Providence divine
some food we had and some fresh water that
a noble Neapolitan Gonzalo
out of his charity who being then appointed
master of this design did give us with
rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
knowing I lov'd my books he furnish'd me
from mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom

would I might
but ever see that man

now I arise

here in this island we arriv'd and here
have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
than other princes can that have more time
for vainer hours and tutors not so careful

heavens thank you for't And now I pray you sir
for still tis beating in my mind your reason
for raising this sea-storm

know thus far forth
by accident most strange bountiful Fortune
now my dear lady hath mine enemies
brought to this shore and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
a most auspicious star whose influence
if now I court not but omit my fortunes
will ever after droop Here cease more questions
thou art inclin'd to sleep tis a good dulness
and give it way I know thou canst not choose
come away servant come I'm ready now
approach my Ariel come


all hail great master grave sir hail I come
to answer thy best pleasure be't to fly
to swim to dive into the fire to ride
on the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality

hast thou spirit
perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee

to every article
I boarded the king's ship now on the beak
now in the waist the deck in every cabin
I flam'd amazement sometime I'd divide
and burn in many places on the topmast
the yards and boresprit would I flame distinctly
o' the dreadful thunder-claps more momentary
and sight-outrunning were not the fire and cracks
of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
yea his dread trident shake

my brave spirit
who was so firm so constant that this coil
would not infect his reason

not a soul
but felt a fever of the mad and play'd
some tricks of desperation All but mariners
plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel
then all a-fire with me the king's son Ferdinand
with hair up-staring then like reeds not hair
was the first man that leap'd cried Hell is empty
and all the devils are here

but was not this nigh shore

close by my master

but are they Ariel safe

not a hair perish'd
on their sustaining garments not a blemish
but fresher than before and as thou bad'st me
in troops I have dispers'd them bout the isle
the king's son have I landed by himself
whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting
his arms in this sad knot

of the king's ship
the mariners say how thou hast dispos'd
and all the rest o' the fleet

is the king's ship in the deep nook where once
thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
from the still-vex'd Bermoothes there she's hid
the mariners all under hatches stow'd
who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour
I have left asleep and for the rest o' the fleet
which I dispers'd they all have met again
and are upon the Mediterranean flote
bound sadly home for Naples
supposing that they saw the king's ship wrack'd
and his great person perish

Ariel thy charge
exactly is perform'd but there's more work
what is the time o' th' day

past the mid season

at least two glasses The time twixt six and now

is there more toil Since thou dost give me pains
let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd
which is not yet perform'd me

how now moody
what is't thou canst demand

my liberty

before the time be out no more

I prithee
remember I have done thee worthy service
told thee no lies made no mistakings serv'd
without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise
to bate me a full year

dost thou forget

no

thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze
of the salt deep
to run upon the sharp wind of the north
to do me business in the veins o' th' earth
when it is bak'd with frost

I do not sir

thou liest malignant thing Hast thou forgot
the foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy
was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her

no sir

thou hast Where was she born speak tell me


O was she so I must
once in a month recount what thou hast been
which thou forget'st This damn'd witch Sycorax
for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
to enter human hearing from Argier
thou know'st was banish'd for one thing she did
they would not take her life Is not this true

ay sir

this blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child
and here was left by the sailors Thou my slave
as thou report'st thyself wast then her servant
and for thou wast a spirit too delicate
to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands
refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
by help of her more potent ministers
and in her most unmitigable rage
imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
a dozen years within which space she died
and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
as fast as mill-wheels strike Then was this island
save for the son that she did litter here
a freckled whelp hag-born not honour'd with
a human shape

yes Caliban her son

dull thing I say so he that Caliban
whom now I keep in service Thou best know'st
what torment I did find thee in thy groans
did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
of ever-angry bears it was a torment
to lay upon the damn'd which Sycorax
could not again undo it was mine art
when I arriv'd and heard thee that made gape
the pine and let thee out
I thank thee master

if thou more murmur'st I will rend an oak
and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
thou hast howl'd away twelve winters

pardon master
I will be correspondent to command
and do my spiriting gently

do so and after two days
I will discharge thee

that's my noble master
what shall I do say what what shall I do

go make thyself like a nymph of the sea be subject
to no sight but thine and mine invisible
to every eyeball else Go take this shape

awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well
awake

the strangeness of your story put
heaviness in me

shake it off Come on
we'll visit Caliban my slave who never
yields us kind answer

'Tis a villain sir
I do not love to look on

but as tis
we cannot miss him he does make our fire
fetch in our wood and serves in offices
that profit us What ho slave Caliban
thou earth thou speak
there's wood enough within

come forth I say there's other business for thee
come thou tortoise when


fine apparition My quaint Ariel

hark in thine ear

my lord it shall be done


thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
upon thy wicked dam come forth


as wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
with raven's feather from unwholesome fen
and blister you all o'er

for this be sure to-night thou shalt have cramps
side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins
shall forth at vast of night that they may work
all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd
as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
than bees that made them

I must eat my dinner
this island's mine by Sycorax my mother
which thou tak'st from me When thou camest first
thou strok'dst me and mad'st much of me wouldst give me
water with berries in't and teach me how
to name the bigger light and how the less
that burn by day and night and then I lov'd thee
and show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle
the fresh springs brine-pits barren place and fertile
cursed be I that did so All the charms
for I am all the subjects that you have
which first was mine own king and here you sty me
in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
the rest o' th' island

thou most lying slave
whom stripes may move not kindness I have us'd thee
filth as thou art with human care and lodg'd thee
in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
the honour of my child

oh ho Oh ho would it had been done
thou didst prevent me I had peopled else
this isle with Calibans

abhorred slave
which any print of goodness will not take
being capable of all ill I pitied thee
took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
a thing most brutish I endow'd thy purposes
with words that made them known but thy vile race
though thou didst learn had that in't which good natures
could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
deservedly confin'd into this rock
who hadst deserv'd more than a prison

you taught me language and my profit on't
is I know how to curse the red plague rid you
for learning me your language

hag-seed hence
fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best
to answer other business Shrug'st thou malice
if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
what I command I'll rack thee with old cramps
fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
that beasts shall tremble at thy din
no pray thee


I must obey his art is of such power
it would control my dam's god Setebos
and make a vassal of him

so slave hence

come unto these yellow sands
and then take hands
curtsied when you have and kiss'd
the wild waves whist
foot it featly here and there
and sweet sprites the burden bear
hark hark

the watch-dogs bark

the strain of strutting Chanticleer

where should this music be i' th' air or th' earth
it sounds no more and sure it waits upon
some god o' th' island Sitting on a bank
weeping again the king my father's wrack
this music crept by me upon the waters
allaying both their fury and my passion
with its sweet air thence I have follow'd it
or it hath drawn me rather but tis gone
no it begins again

full fathom five thy father lies
of his bones are coral made
those are pearls that were his eyes
nothing of him that doth fade
but doth suffer a sea-change
into something rich and strange
sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
hark now I hear them ding-dong bell


the ditty does remember my drown'd father
this is no mortal business nor no sound
that the earth owes I hear it now above me

the fringed curtains of thine eye advance
and say what thou seest yond

what is't a spirit
lord how it looks about Believe me sir
it carries a brave form but tis a spirit

no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
as we have such this gallant which thou see'st
was in the wrack and but he's something stain'd
with grief that's beauty's canker thou might'st call him
a goodly person he hath lost his fellows

I might call him
a thing divine for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble

it goes on I see
as my soul prompts it Spirit fine spirit I'll free thee
within two days for this

most sure the goddess
on whom these airs attend Vouchsafe my prayer
may know if you remain upon this island
and that you will some good instruction give
how I may bear me here my prime request
which I do last pronounce is O you wonder
if you be maid or no

no wonder sir
but certainly a maid
my language heavens
I am the best of them that speak this speech
were I but where tis spoken

how the best
what wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee

a single thing as I am now that wonders
to hear thee speak of Naples He does hear me
and that he does I weep myself am Naples
who with mine eyes ne'er since at ebb beheld
the king my father wrack'd

alack for mercy

yes faith and all his lords the Duke of Milan
and his brave son being twain

the Duke of Milan
if now twere fit to do't At the first sight

they have changed eyes delicate Ariel
I'll set thee free for this

a word good sir
I fear you have done yourself some wrong a word

why speaks my father so ungently This
is the third man that e'er I saw the first
that e'er I sigh'd for pity move my father
to be inclin'd my way

O if a virgin
and your affection not gone forth I'll make you
the Queen of Naples

soft sir one word more

they are both in either's powers but this swift business
I must uneasy make lest too light winning
make the prize light

one word more I charge thee
that thou attend me Thou dost here usurp
the name thou ow'st not and hast put thyself
upon this island as a spy to win it
from me the lord on't

no as I am a man

there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
if the ill spirit have so fair a house
good things will strive to dwell with't

follow me


I'll manacle thy neck and feet together
sea-water shalt thou drink thy food shall be
the fresh-brook muscles wither'd roots and husks
wherein the acorn cradled Follow

no
I will resist such entertainment till
mine enemy has more power


O dear father
make not too rash a trial of him for
he's gentle and not fearful

what I say
my foot my tutor Put thy sword up traitor
who mak'st a show but dar'st not strike thy conscience
is so possess'd with guilt come from thy ward
for I can here disarm thee with this stick

beseech you father

hence hang not on my garments

sir have pity
I'll be his surety

silence one word more
shall make me chide thee if not hate thee What
an advocate for an impostor hush
thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he
having seen but him and Caliban foolish wench
to the most of men this is a Caliban
and they to him are angels

my affections
are then most humble I have no ambition
to see a goodlier man
come on obey
thy nerves are in their infancy again
and have no vigour in them

so they are
my spirits as in a dream are all bound up
my father's loss the weakness which I feel
the wrack of all my friends or this man's threats
to whom I am subdued are but light to me
might I but through my prison once a day
behold this maid all corners else o' th' earth
let liberty make use of space enough
have I in such a prison

come on
thou hast done well fine Ariel

follow me

hark what thou else shalt do me

be of comfort
my father's of a better nature sir
than he appears by speech this is unwonted
which now came from him

thou shalt be as free
as mountain winds but then exactly do
all points of my command

to the syllable

come follow Speak not for him

beseech you sir be merry you have cause
so have we all of joy for our escape
is much beyond our loss Our hint of woe
is common every day some sailor's wife
have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
I mean our preservation few in millions
can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh
our sorrow with our comfort

prithee peace

he receives comfort like cold porridge

the visitor will not give him o'er so

look he's winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike

sir

one tell

when every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd
comes to the entertainer
a dollar

dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purposed

you have taken it wiselier than I meant you should

therefore my lord

fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue

I prithee spare

well I have done but yet

he will be talking

which of he or Adrian for a good wager first begins to crow

the old cock
the cockerel

done The wager

a laughter

a match

though this island seem to be desert

ha ha ha So you're paid

uninhabitable and almost inaccessible

yet

yet

he could not miss it
it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance

temperance was a delicate wench

ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered

the air breathes upon us here most sweetly

as if it had lungs and rotten ones

or as twere perfumed by a fen

here is everything advantageous to life

true save means to live

of that there's none or little

how lush and lusty the grass looks how green
the ground indeed is tawny

with an eye of green in't

he misses not much

no he doth but mistake the truth totally

but the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit

as many vouch'd rarities are

that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new-dyed than stain'd with salt water

if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies

ay or very falsely pocket up his report

methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
'Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return

Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen

not since widow Dido's time

widow a pox o' that How came that widow in Widow Dido

what if he had said widower neas too Good Lord how you take it

widow Dido said you you make me study of that she was of Carthage not of Tunis

this Tunis sir was Carthage

Carthage

I assure you Carthage

his word is more than the miraculous harp
he hath rais'd the wall and houses too

what impossible matter will he make easy next

I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple

and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands

ay

why in good time

sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queen

and the rarest that e'er came there

bate I beseech you widow Dido

O widow Dido ay widow Dido
is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it I mean in a sort

that sort was well fish'd for

when I wore it at your daughter's marriage

you cram these words into mine ears against
the stomach of my sense Would I had never
married my daughter there for coming thence
my son is lost and in my rate she too
who is so far from Italy remov'd
I ne'er again shall see her O thou mine heir
of Naples and of Milan what strange fish
hath made his meal on thee

sir he may live
I saw him beat the surges under him
and ride upon their backs he trod the water
whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
'Bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd
himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
to the shore that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd
as stooping to relieve him I not doubt
he came alive to land

no no he's gone

sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
that would not bless our Europe with your daughter
but rather lose her to an African
where she at least is banish'd from your eye
who hath cause to wet the grief on't

prithee peace

you were kneel'd to and importun'd otherwise
by all of us and the fair soul herself
weigh'd between loathness and obedience at
I fear for ever Milan and Naples have
more widows in them of this business' making
than we bring men to comfort them the fault's
your own

so is the dearest of the loss

my lord Sebastian
the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
and time to speak it in you rub the sore
when you should bring the plaster

very well

and most chirurgeonly

it is foul weather in us all good sir
when you are cloudy


very foul

had I plantation of this isle my lord

he'd sow't with nettle-seed

or docks or mallows

'And were the king on't what would I do

'Scape being drunk for want of wine

i' the commonwealth I would by contraries
execute all things for no kind of traffic
would I admit no name of magistrate
letters should not be known riches poverty
and use of service none contract succession
bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
no occupation all men idle all
and women too but innocent and pure
no sovereignty

yet he would be king on't

the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning

all things in common nature should produce
without sweat or endeavour treason felony
sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
would I not have but nature should bring forth
of its own kind all foison all abundance
to feed my innocent people

no marrying mong his subjects

none man all idle whores and knaves

to excel the golden age

save his majesty

long live Gonzalo

and do you mark me sir

prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me

I do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing

'Twas you we laugh'd at

who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still

what a blow was there given

an it had not fallen flat-long
you are gentlemen of brave mettle you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing


we would so and then go a-bat-fowling

nay good my lord be not angry

no I warrant you I will not adventure my discretion so weakly Will you laugh me asleep for I am very heavy

go sleep and hear us


what all so soon asleep I wish mine eyes
would with themselves shut up my thoughts I find
they are inclin'd to do so

please you sir
do not omit the heavy offer of it
it seldom visits sorrow when it doth

we two my lord
will guard your person while you take your rest
and watch your safety

thank you Wondrous heavy


what a strange drowsiness possesses them

it is the quality o' the climate

why
doth it not then our eyelids sink I find not
myself dispos'd to sleep

nor I my spirits are nimble
they fell together all as by consent
they dropp'd as by a thunder-stroke What might
and yet methinks I see it in thy face
what thou should'st be The occasion speaks thee and
my strong imagination sees a crown
dropping upon thy head

what art thou waking

do you not hear me speak

I do and surely
it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
out of thy sleep What is it thou didst say
this is a strange repose to be asleep
with eyes wide open standing speaking moving
and yet so fast asleep

noble Sebastian
thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather wink'st
whiles thou art waking
thou dost snore distinctly
there's meaning in thy snores

I am more serious than my custom you
must be so too if heed me which to do
trebles thee o'er

well I am standing water

I'll teach you how to flow

do so to ebb
hereditary sloth instructs me

O 
if you but knew how you the purpose cherish
whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
you more invest it Ebbing men indeed
most often do so near the bottom run

prithee say on
the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
a matter from thee and a birth indeed
which throes thee much to yield

thus sir
although this lord of weak remembrance this
who shall be of as little memory
when he is earth'd hath here almost persuaded
for he's a spirit of persuasion only
professes to persuade the king his son's alive
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
as he that sleeps here swims

I have no hope
that he's undrown'd

O out of that no hope
another way so high a hope that even
ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
but doubts discovery there Will you grant with me
that Ferdinand is drown'd

he's gone

then tell me
who's the next heir of Naples

Claribel

she that is Queen of Tums she that dwells
ten leagues beyond man's life she that from Naples
can have no note unless the sun were post
the man i' th' moon's too slow till new-born chins
be rough and razorable she that from whom
we all were sea-swallow'd though some cast again
and by that destiny to perform an act
in yours and my discharge

what stuff is this How say you
'Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis
so is she heir of Naples twixt which regions
there is some space

a space whose every cubit
seems to cry out How shall that Claribel
measure us back to Naples Keep in Tunis
and let Sebastian wake Say this were death
that now hath seiz'd them why they were no worse
than now they are There be that can rule Naples
as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
as amply and unnecessarily
as this Gonzalo I myself could make
a chough of as deep chat O that you bore
the mind that I do what a sleep were this
for your advancement Do you understand me
methinks I do

and how does your content
tender your own good fortune

I remember
you did supplant your brother Prospero

true
and look how well my garments sit upon me
much feater than before my brother's servants
were then my fellows now they are my men

but for your conscience

ay sir where lies that if it were a kibe
'Twould put me to my slipper but I feel not
this deity in my bosom twenty consciences
that stand twixt me and Milan candied be they
no better than the earth he lies upon
if he were that which now he's like that's dead
whom I with this obedient steel three inches of it
can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
to the perpetual wink for aye might put
this ancient morsel this Sir Prudence who
should not upbraid our course For all the rest
they'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
they'll tell the clock to any business that
we say befits the hour

thy case dear friend
shall be my precedent as thou got'st Milan
I'll come by Naples Draw thy sword one stroke
shall free thee from the tribute which thou pay'st
and I the king shall love thee

draw together
and when I rear my hand do you the like

O but one word

my master through his art foresees the danger
that you his friend are in and sends me forth
for else his project dies to keep thee living


while you here do snoring lie
open-ey'd Conspiracy
his time doth take
if of life you keep a care
shake off slumber and beware
awake awake


then let us both be sudden

now good angels


why how now ho awake Why are you drawn
wherefore this ghastly looking

what's the matter

whiles we stood here securing your repose
even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
like bulls or rather hons did't not wake you
it struck mine ear most terribly

I heard nothing

O twas a din to fright a monster's ear
to make an earthquake sure it was the roar
of a whole herd of lions

heard you this Gonzalo
upon mine honour sir I heard a humming
and that a strange one too which did awake me
I shak'd you sir and cry'd as mine eyes open'd
I saw their weapons drawn there was a noise
that's verily Tis best we stand upon our guard
or that we quit this place let's draw our weapons

lead off this ground and let's make further search
for my poor son

heavens keep him from these beasts
for he is sure i' the island

lead away


Prospero my lord shall know what I have done
so king go safely on to seek thy son

all the infections that the sun sucks up
from bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him
by inch-meal a disease His spirits hear me
and yet I needs must curse But they'll nor pinch
fright me with urchin-shows pitch me i' the mire
nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark
out of my way unless he bid em but
for every trifle are they set upon me
sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
and after bite me then like hedge-hogs which
lie tumbling in my bare-foot way and mount
their pricks at my foot-fall sometime am I
all wound with adders who with cloven tongues
do hiss me into madness


lo now lo
here comes a spirit of his and to torment me
for bringing wood in slowly I'll fall flat
perchance he will not mind me

here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all and another storm brewing I hear it sing i' the wind yond same black cloud yond huge one looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor If it should thunder as it did before I know not where to hide my head yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls What have we here a man or a fish Dead or alive A fish he smells like a fish a very ancient and fish-like smell a kind of not of the newest Poor-John A strange fish Were I in England now as once I was and had but this fish painted not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver there would this monster make a man any strange beast there makes a man When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian Legg'd like a man and his fins like arms Warm o' my troth I do now let loose my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt

alas the storm is come again my best way is to creep under his gaberdine there is no other shelter hereabout misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past

I shall no more to sea to sea
here shall I die a-shore

this is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral
well here's my comfort


the master the swabber the boatswain and I
the gunner and his mate
lov'd Mall Meg and Marian and Margery
but none of us car'd for Kate
for she had a tongue with a tang
would cry to a sailor Go hang
yet a tailor might scratch her where-e'er she did itch
then to sea boys and let her go hang

this is a scurvy tune too but here's my comfort


do not torment me O

what's the matter Have we devils here Do you put tricks upon us with savages and men of Ind Ha I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs for it hath been said As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at's nostrils

the spirit torments me O

this is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got as I take it an ague Where the devil should he learn our language I will give him some relief if it be but for that if I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's-leather

do not torment me prithee I'll bring my wood home faster

he's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest He shall taste of my bottle if he have never drunk wine afore it will go near to remove his fit If I can recover him and keep him tame I will not take too much for him he shall pay for him that hath him and that soundly

thou dost me yet but little hurt thou wilt anon I know it by thy trembling now Prosper works upon thee
come on your ways open your mouth here is that which will give language to you cat Open your mouth this will shake your shaking I can tell you and that soundly

: you cannot tell who's your friend open your chaps again

I should know that voice it should be but he is drowned and these are devils O defend me

four legs and two voices a most delicate monster His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract If all the wine in my bottle will recover him I will help his ague Come Amen I will pour some in thy other mouth

Stephano

doth thy other mouth call me Mercy mercy This is a devil and no monster I will leave him I have no long spoon

Stephano if thou beest Stephano touch me and speak to me for I am Trinculo be not afeard thy good friend Trinculo

if thou beest Trinculo come forth I'll pull thee by the lesser legs if any be Trinculo's legs these are they Thou art very Trinculo indeed How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf Can he vent Trinculos

I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke But art thou not drowned Stephano I hope now thou art not drowned Is the storm overblown I hid me under the dead mooncalf's gaberdine for fear of the storm And art thou living Stephano O Stephano two Neapolitans scaped

prithee do not turn me about my stomach is not constant
these be fine things an if they be not sprites
that's a brave god and bears celestial liquor
I will kneel to him

how didst thou scape How cam'st thou hither swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved overboard by this bottle which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore

I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject for the liquor is not earthly

here swear then how thou escapedst

swam ashore man like a duck I can swim like a duck I'll be sworn

here kiss the book

. Though thou canst swim like a duck thou art made like a goose

O Stephano hast any more of this

the whole butt man my cellar is in a rock by the seaside where my wine is hid How now moon-calf how does thine ague
hast thou not dropped from heaven

out o the moon I do assure thee I was the man in the moon when time was

I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee my mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush

come swear to that kiss the book I will furnish it anon with new contents swear

by this good light this is a very shallow monster I afeard of him a very weak monster The man i' the moon a most poor credulous monster Well drawn monster in good sooth

I'll show thee every fertile inch o' the island
and I will kiss thy foot I prithee be my god

by this light a most perfidious and drunken monster when his god's asleep he'll rob his bottle

I'll kiss thy foot I'll swear myself thy subject

come on then down and swear


come kiss

but that the poor monster's in drink an abominable monster

I'll shew thee the best springs I'll pluck thee berries
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough
a plague upon the tyrant that I serve
I'll bear him no more sticks but follow thee
thou wondrous man

a most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of a poor drunkard

I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow
and I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts
show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
to snare the nimble marmozet I'll bring thee
to clust'ring filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
young scamels from the rock Wilt thou go with me
I prithee now lead the way without any more talking Trinculo the king and all our company else being drowned we will inherit here Here bear my bottle Fellow Trinculo we'll fill him by and by again

farewell master farewell farewell


a howling monster a drunken monster


no more dams I'll make for fish
nor fetch in firing
at requiring
nor scrape trenchering nor wash dish
'Ban Ban Ca Caliban
has a new master Get a new man

freedom high-day high-day freedom freedom high-day freedom

O brave monster lead the way

delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
are nobly undergone and most poor matters
point to rich ends This my mean task
would be as heavy to me as odious but
the mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
and makes my labours pleasures O she is
ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed
and he's compos'd of harshness I must remove
some thousands of these logs and pile them up
upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
had never like executor I forget
but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
most busiest when I do it


alas now pray you
work not so hard I would the lightning had
burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile
'Twill weep for having wearied you My father
is hard at study pray now rest yourself
he's safe for these three hours

O most dear mistress
the sun will set before I shall discharge
what I must strive to do

if you'll sit down
I'll bear your logs the while Pray give me that
I'll carry it to the pile

no precious creature
I had rather crack my sinews break my back
than you should such dishonour undergo
while I sit lazy by

it would become me
as well as it does you and I should do it
and yours it is against

poor worm thou art infected
this visitation shows it

you look wearily

no noble mistress tis fresh morning with me
when you are by at night I do beseech you
chiefly that I might set it in my prayers
what is your name

Miranda O my father
I have broke your hest to say so

admir'd Miranda
indeed the top of admiration worth
what's dearest to the world Full many a lady
I have ey'd with best regard and many a time
brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
have I lik'd several women never any
with so full soul but some defect in her
did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd
and put it to the foil but you O you
so perfect and so peerless are created
of every creature's best

I do not know
one of my sex no woman's face remember
save from my glass mine own nor have I seen
more that I may call men than you good friend
and my dear father how features are abroad
I am skill-less of but by my modesty
the jewel in my dower I would not wish
any companion in the world but you
nor can imagination form a shape
besides yourself to like of But I prattle
something too wildly and my father's precepts

I am in my condition
a prince Miranda I do think a king
I would not so and would no more endure
this wooden slavery than to suffer
the flesh-fly blow my mouth Hear my soul speak
the very instant that I saw you did
my heart fly to your service there resides
to make me slave to it and for your sake
am I this patient log-man

do you love me

O heaven O earth bear witness to this sound
and crown what I profess with kind event
if I speak true if hollowly invert
what best is boded me to mischief I
beyond all limit of what else i' the world
do love prize honour you
I am a fool
to weep at what I am glad of

fair encounter
of two most rare affections Heavens rain grace
on that which breeds between them

wherefore weep you

at mine unworthiness that dare not offer
what I desire to give and much less take
what I shall die to want But this is trifling
and all the more it seeks to hide itself
the bigger bulk it shows Hence bashful cunning
and prompt me plain and holy innocence
I am your wife if you will marry me
if not I'll die your maid to be your fellow
you may deny me but I'll be your servant
whether you will or no
my mistress dearest
and I thus humble ever

my husband then

ay with a heart as willing
as bondage e'er of freedom here's my hand

and mine with my heart in't and now farewell
till half an hour hence

a thousand thousand


so glad of this as they I cannot be
who are surpris'd withal but my rejoicing
at nothing can be more I'll to my book
for yet ere supper time must I perform
much business appertaining

tell not me when the butt is out we will drink water not a drop before therefore bear up and board em Servant-monster drink to me

servant-monster the folly of this island They say there's but five upon this isle we are three of them if th' other two be brained like us the state totters

drink servant-monster when I bid thee thy eyes are almost set in thy head

where should they be set else he were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail

my man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack for my part the sea cannot drown me I swam ere I could recover the shore five-and-thirty leagues off and on by this light Thou shalt be my lieutenant monster or my standard

your lieutenant if you list he's no standard

we'll not run Monsieur monster

nor go neither but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither

moon-calf speak once in thy life if thou beest a good moon-calf


thou hest most ignorant monster I am in case to justle a constable Why thou deboshed fish thou was there ever a man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie being but half a fish and half a monster

lo how he mocks me wilt thou let him my lord

'Lord' quoth he that a monster should be such a natural

lo lo again bite him to death I prithee

Trinculo keep a good tongue in your head if you prove a mutineer the next tree The poor monster's my subject and he shall not suffer indignity

I thank my noble lord Wilt thou be pleas'd
to hearken once again the suit I made thee

marry will I kneel and repeat it I will stand and so shall Trinculo


as I told thee before I am subject to a tyrant a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island


thou liest thou jesting monkey thou
I would my valiant master would destroy thee
I do not lie

Trinculo if you trouble him any more in his tale by this hand I will supplant some of your teeth

why I said nothing

mum then and no more

proceed

I say by sorcery he got this isle
from me he got it if thy greatness will
revenge it on him for I know thou dar'st
but this thing dare not

that's most certain
thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee

how now shall this be compassed Canst thou bring me to the party

yea yea my lord I'll yield him thee asleep
where thou may'st knock a nail into his head

thou liest thou canst not

what a pied ninny's this Thou scurvy patch
I do beseech thy greatness give him blows
and take his bottle from him when that's gone
he shall drink nought but brine for I'll not show him
where the quick freshes are

Trinculo run into no further danger interrupt the monster one word further and by this hand I'll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a stock-fish of thee

why what did I I did nothing I'll go further off


thou liest

do I so take thou that


as you like this give me the lie another time

I did not give thee the he Out o' your wits and hearing too A pox o' your bottle this can sack and drinking do A murrain on your monster and the devil take your fingers

ha ha ha

now forward with your tale Prithee stand further off

beat him enough after a little time
I'll beat him too

stand further Come proceed

i' the afternoon to sleep there thou may'st brain him
having first seiz'd his books or with a log
batter his skull or paunch him with a stake
or cut his wezand with thy knife Remember
first to possess his books for without them
he's but a sot as I am nor hath not
one spirit to command they all do hate him
as rootedly as I Burn but his books
he has brave utensils for so he calls them
which when he has a house he'll deck withal
and that most deeply to consider is
the beauty of his daughter he himself
calls her a nonpareil I never saw a woman
but only Sycorax my dam and she
but she as far surpasseth Sycorax
as great'st does least

is it so brave a lass

and bring thee forth brave brood

monster I will kill this man his daughter and I will be king and queen save our graces and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys Dost thou like the plot Trinculo

excellent

give me thy hand I am sorry I beat thee but while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head

within this half hour will he be asleep
wilt thou destroy him then

ay on mine honour

this will I tell my master

thou mak'st me merry I am full of pleasure
let us be jocund will you troll the catch
you taught me but while-ere



flout em and scout em and scout em and flout em
thought is free


that's not the tune


what is this same

this is the tune of our catch played by the picture of Nobody

if thou beest a man show thyself in thy likeness if thou beest a devil take't as thou list

O forgive me my sins

he that dies pays all debts I defy thee Mercy upon us


no monster not I

be not afeard the isle is full of noises
sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
will hum about mine ears and sometime voices
that if I then had wak'd after long sleep
will make mesleep again and then in dreaming
the clouds methought would open and show riches
ready to drop upon me that when I wak'd
I cried to dream again

this will prove a brave kingdom to me where I shall have my music for nothing

when Prospero is destroyed

that shall be by and by I remember the story


lead monster we'll follow I would I could see this taborer he lays it on Wilt come

I'll follow Stephano


by'r lakin I can go no further sir
my old bones ache here's a maze trod indeed
through forth-rights and meanders by your patience
I needs must rest me

old lord I cannot blame thee
who am myself attach'd with weariness
to the dulling of my spirits sit down and rest
even here I will put off my hope and keep it
no longer for my flatterer he is drown'd
whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks
our frustrate search on land Well let him go

do not for one repulse forego the purpose
that you resolv'd to effect

the next advantage
will we take throughly

let it be to-night
for now they are oppress'd with travel they
will not nor cannot use such vigilance
as when they are fresh

I say to-night no more

what harmony is this my good friends hark

marvellous sweet music

give us kind keepers heavens What were these

that there are unicorns that in Arabia
there is one tree the ph nix' throne one ph nix
at this hour reigning there

I'll believe both
and what does else want credit come to me
and I'll be sworn tis true travellers ne'er did lie
though fools at home condemn them

if in Naples
I should report this now would they believe me
if I should say I saw such islanders
for certes these are people of the island
who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
their manners are more gentle-kind than of
our human generation you shall find
many nay almost any

honest lord
are worse than devils

I cannot too much muse
such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
although they want the use of tongue a kind
of excellent dumb discourse

praise in departing

they vanish'd strangely

no matter since
they have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
will't please you to taste of what is here

not I

faith sir you need not fear When we were boys
who would believe that there were mountaineers
wallets of flesh or that there were such men
whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
each putter-out of five for one will bring us
good warrant of

I will stand to and feed
although my last no matter since I feel
the best is past Brother my lord the duke
stand to and do as we

you are three men of sin whom Destiny
that hath to instrument this lower world
and what is in't the never-surfeited sea
hath caused to belch up you and on this island
where man doth not inhabit you mongst men
being most unfit to live I have made you mad


and even with such-like valour men hang and drown
are ministers of fate the elements
of whom your swords are temper'd may as well
wound the loud winds or with bemock'd-at stabs
kill the still-closing waters as diminish
one dowle that's in my plume my fellow-ministers
are like invulnerable If you could hurt
your swords are now too massy for your strengths
and will not be uplifted But remember
for that's my business to you that you three
from Milan did supplant good Prospero
expos'd unto the sea which hath requit it
him and his innocent child for which foul deed
the powers delaying not forgetting have
incens'd the seas and shores yea all the creatures
against your peace Thee of thy son Alonso
they have bereft and do pronounce by me
lingering perdition worse than any death
can be at once shall step by step attend
you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from
upon your heads is nothing but heart-sorrow
and a clear life ensuing


bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
perform'd my Ariel a grace it had devouring
of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
in what thou hadst to say so with good life
and observation strange my meaner ministers
their several kinds have done My high charms work
and these mine enemies are all knit up
in their distractions they now are in my power
and in these fits I leave them while I visit
young Ferdinand whom they suppose is drown'd
and his and mine lov'd darling


I the name of something holy sir why stand you
in this strange stare
O it is monstrous monstrous
methought the billows spoke and told me of it
the winds did sing it to me and the thunder
that deep and dreadful organ-pipe pronounc'd
the name of Prosper it did bass my trespass
therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded and
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
and with him there lie mudded


but one fiend at a time
I'll fight their legions o'er

I'll be thy second


all three of them are desperate their great guilt
like poison given to work a great time after
now gins to bite the spirits I do beseech you
and hinder them from what this ecstasy
may now provoke them to

follow I pray you

if I have too austerely punish'd you
your compensation makes amends for I
have given you here a third of mine own life
or that for which I live whom once again
I tender to thy hand all thy vexations
were but my trials of thy love and thou
hast strangely stood the test here afore Heaven
I ratify this my rich gift O Ferdinand
do not smile at me that I boast her off
for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
and make it halt behind her

I do believe it
against an oracle
then as my gift and thine own acquisition
worthily purchas'd take my daughter but
if thou dost break her virgin knot before
all sanctimonious ceremonies may
with full and holy rite be minister'd
no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
to make this contract grow but barren hate
sour-ey'd disdain and discord shall bestrew
the union of your bed with weeds so loathly
that you shall hate it both therefore take heed
as Hymen's lamps shall light you

as I hope
for quiet days fair issue and long life
with such love as tis now the murkiest den
the most opportune place the strong'st sug gestion
our worser genius can shall never melt
mine honour into lust to take away
the edge of that day's celebration
or Night kept chain'd below

fairly spoke
sit then and talk with her she is thine own
what Ariell my industrious servant Ariell


what would my potent master here I am

thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
did worthily perform and I must use you
in such another trick Go bring the rabble
o'er whom I give thee power here to this place
incite them to quick motion for I must
bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
some vanity of mine art it is my promise
and they expect it from me

presently
ay with a twink

before you can say Come and Go
and breathe twice and cry so so
each one tripping on his toe
will be here with mop and mow
do you love me master no

dearly my delicate Ariel Do not approach
till thou dost hear me call

well I conceive


look thou be true do not give dalliance
too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw
to the fire i' the blood be more abstemious
or else good night your vow

the white-cold virgin snow upon my heart
abates the ardour of my liver

well
now come my Ariel bring a corollary
rather than want a spirit appear and pertly
no tongue all eyes be silent

Ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas
of wheat rye barley vetches oats and peas
thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep
and flat meads thatch'd with stover them to keep
thy banks with pioned and twilled brims
which spongy April at thy hest betrims
to make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves
whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves
being lass-lorn thy pole-clipt vineyard
and thy sea-marge sterile and rocky-hard
where thou thyself dost air the queen o' the sky
bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace
here on this grass-plot in this very place
to come and sport her peacocks fly amain
approach rich Ceres her to entertain


hail many-colour'd messenger that ne'er
dost disobey the wife of Jupiter
who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
diffusest honey-drops refreshing showers
and with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
my bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down
rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen
summon'd me hither to this short-grass'd green

a contract of true love to celebrate
and some donation freely to estate
on the bless'd lovers

if Venus or her son as thou dost know
do now attend the queen since they did plot
the means that dusky Dis my daughter got
her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
I have forsworn

of her society
be not afraid I met her deity
cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
dove-drawn with her Here thought they to have done
some wanton charm upon this man and maid
whose vows are that no bed-rite shall be paid
till Hymen's torch be lighted but in vain
Mars's hot minion is return'd again
her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows
swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
and be a boy right out

highest queen of state


how does my bounteous sister Go with me
to bless this twain that they may prosperous be
and honour'd in their issue

honour riches marriage-blessing
long continuance and increasing
hourly joys be still upon you
Juno sings her blessings on you

earth's increase foison plenty
barns and garners never empty
vines with clust'ring bunches growing
plants with goodly burden bowing
spring come to you at the farthest
in the very end of harvest
scarcity and want shall shun you
Ceres' blessing so is on you
this is a most majestic vision and
harmonious charmingly May I be bold
to think these spirits

spirits which by mine art
I have from their confines call'd to enact
my present fancies

let me live here ever
so rare a wonder'd father and a wise
makes this place Paradise


sweet now silence
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously
there's something else to do hush and be mute
or else our spell is marr'd

you nymphs call'd Naiades of the windring brooks
leave your crisp channels and on this green land
answer your summons Juno does command
come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate
a contract of true love be not too late


you sun-burn'd sicklemen of August weary
come hither from the furrow and be merry
make holiday your rye-straw hats put on
and these fresh nymphs encounter every one
in country footing


I had forgot that foul conspiracy
of the beast Caliban and his confederates
against my life the minute of their plot
is almost come

well done avoid no more
this is strange your father's in some passion
that works him strongly

never till this day
saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd

you do look my son in a mov'd sort
as if you were dismay'd be cheerful sir
our revels now are ended These our actors
as I foretold you were all spirits and
are melted into air into thin air
and like the baseless fabric of this vision
the cloud-capp'd towers the gorgeous palaces
the solemn temples the great globe itself
yea all which it inherit shall dissolve
and like this insubstantial pageant faded
leave not a rack behind We are such stuff
as dreams are made on and our little life
is rounded with a sleep Sir I am vex'd
be not disturb'd with my infirmity
if you be pleas'd retire into my cell
and there repose a turn or two I'll walk
to still my beating mind

we wish your peace


come with a thought

I thank thee Ariel come


thy thoughts I cleave to What's thy pleasure

spirit
we must prepare to meet with Caliban

ay my commander when I presented Ceres
lest I might anger thee

say again where didst thou leave these varlets

I told you sir they were red-hot with drinking
so full of valour that they smote the air
for breathing in their faces beat the ground
for kissing of their feet yet always bending
towards their project Then I beat my tabor
at which like unback'd colts they prick'd their ears
advanc'd their eyelids lifted up their noses
as they smelt music so I charm'd their ears
that calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns
which enter'd their frail shins at last I left them
i' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell
there dancing up to the chins that the foul lake
o'erstunk their feet

thy shape invisible retain thou still
the trumpery in my house go bring it hither
for stale to catch these thieves

I go I go


a devil a born devil on whose nature
nurture can never stick on whom my pains
humanely taken are all lost quite lost
and as with age his body uglier grows
so his mind cankers I will plague them all
even to roaring


come hang them on this line

pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not
hear a foot fall we now are near his cell
monster your fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played the Jack with us

monster I do smell all horse-piss at which my nose is in great indignation

so is mine Do you hear monster If I should take a displeasure against you look you

thou wert but a lost monster

good my lord give me thy favour still
be patient for the prize I'll bring thee to
shall hoodwink this mischance therefore speak softly
all's hush'd as midnight yet

ay but to lose our bottles in the pool

there is not only disgrace and dishonour in that monster but an infinite loss

that's more to me than my wetting yet this is your harmless fairy monster


prithee my king be quiet Seest thou here
this is the mouth o' the cell no noise and enter
do that good mischief which may make this island
thine own for ever and I thy Caliban
for aye thy foot-licker

give me thy hand I do begin to have bloody thoughts

O king Stephano O peer O worthy Stephano look what a wardrobe here is for thee

let it alone thou fool it is but trash

O ho monster we know what belongs to a frippery O king Stephano

put off that gown Trinculo by this hand I'll have that gown

thy grace shall have it

to dote thus on such luggage Let's along
and do the murder first if he awake
from toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches
make us strange stuff

be you quiet monster Mistress line is not this my jerkin Now is the jerkin under the line now jerkin you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin

do do we steal by line and level an't like your grace

I thank thee for that jest here's a garment for't wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country Steal by line and level is an excellent pass of pate there's another garment for't

monster come put some lime upon your fingers and away with the rest

I will have none on't we shall lose our time
and all be turn'd to barnacles or to apes
with foreheads villanous low

monster lay-to your fingers help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is or I'll turn you out of my kingdom Go to carry this


ay and this

hey Mountain hey

silver there it goes Silver

fury Fury there Tyrant there hark hark

go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews
with aged cramps and more pinch-spotted make them
than pard or cat o' mountain

hark they roar

let them be hunted soundly At this hour
lie at my mercy all mine enemies
shortly shall all my labours end and thou
follow and do me service

now does my project gather to a head
my charms crack not my spirits obey and time
goes upright with his carriage How's the day

on the sixth hour at which time my lord
you said our work should cease

I did say so
when first I rais'd the tempest Say my spirit
how fares the king and's followers

confin'd together
in the same fashion as you gave in charge
just as you left them all prisoners sir
in the line-grove which weather-fends your cell
they cannot budge till your release The king
his brother and yours abide all three distracted
brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
him that you term'd sir The good old lord Gonzalo
his tears run down his beard like winter's drops
from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works them
that if you now beheld them your affections
would become tender

dost thou think so spirit

mine would sir were I human

and mine shall
hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
of their afflictions and shall not myself
one of their kind that relish all as sharply
passion as they be kindlier mov'd than thou art
though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick
yet with my nobler reason gainst my fury
do I take part the rarer action is
the sole drift of my purpose doth extend
not a frown further Go release them Ariel
my charms I'll break their senses I'll restore
and they shall be themselves

I'll fetch them sir


ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves
and ye that on the sands with printless foot
do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
when he comes back you demi-puppets that
by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
weak masters though ye be I have bedimm'd
the noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds
and twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
with his own bolt the strong-bas'd promontory
have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
the pine and cedar graves at my command
have wak'd their sleepers op'd and let them forth
by my so potent art But this rough magic
I here abjure and when I have requir'd
some heavenly music which even now I do
to work mine end upon their senses that
this airy charm is for I'll break my staff
bury it certain fathoms in the earth
and deeper than did ever plummet sound
I'll drown my book

a solemn air and the best comforter
to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
now useless boil'd within thy skull There stand
for you are spell-stopp'd
holy Gonzalo honourable man
fall fellowly drops The charm dissolves apace
and as the morning steals upon the night
melting the darkness so their rising senses
begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
their clearer reason O good Gonzalo
my true preserver and a loyal sir
to him thou follow'st I will pay thy graces
home both in word and deed Most cruelly
didst thou Alonso use me and my daughter
thy brother was a furtherer in the act
thou'rt pinch'd for't now Sebastian Flesh and blood
you brother mine that entertain'd ambition
expell'd remorse and nature who with Sebastian
whose inward pinches therefore are most strong
would here have kill'd your king I do forgive thee
unnatural though thou art Their understanding
begins to swell and the approaching tide
will shortly fill the reasonable shores
that now lie foul and muddy Not one of them
fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell

I will discase me and myself present
as I was sometime Milan Quickly spirit
thou shalt ere long be free


where the bee sucks there suck I
in a cowslip's bell I he
there I couch when owls do cry
on the bat's back I do fly
after summer merrily
merrily merrily shall I live now
under the blossom that hangs on the bough


why that's my dainty Ariel I shall miss thee
but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so
to the king's ship invisible as thou art
under the hatches the master and the boatswain
being awake enforce them to this place
and presently I prithee

I drink the air before me and return
or e'er your pulse twice beat


all torment trouble wonder and amazement
inhabits here some heavenly power guide us
out of this fearful country

behold sir king
the wronged Duke of Milan Prospero
for more assurance that a living prince
does now speak to thee I embrace thy body
and to thee and thy company I bid
a hearty welcome

or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
as late I have been I not know thy pulse
beats as of flesh and blood and since I saw thee
th' affliction of my mind amends with which
I fear a madness held me this must crave
an if this be at all a most strange story
thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
thou pardon me my wrongs But how should Prospero
be living and be here

first noble friend
let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
be measur'd or confin'd

whether this be
or be not I'll not swear

you do yet taste
some subtilties o' the isle that will not let you


but you my brace of lords were I so minded
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
and justify you traitors at this time
I will tell no tales

the devil speaks in him

no
for you most wicked sir whom to call brother
would even infect my mouth I do forgive
thy rankest fault all of them and require
my dukedom of thee which perforce I know
thou must restore

if thou beest Prospero
give us particulars of thy preservation
how thou hast met us here who three hours since
how sharp the point of this remembrance is
my dear son Ferdinand

I am woe for't sir

irreparable is the loss and patience
says it is past her cure

I rather think
you have not sought her help of whose soft grace
for the like loss I have her sovereign aid
and rest myself content

you the like loss

as great to me as late and supportable
to make the dear loss have I means much weaker
than you may call to comfort you for I
have lost my daughter
a daughter
O heavens that they were living both in Naples
the king and queen there that they were I wish
myself were mudded in that oozy bed
where my son lies When did you lose your daughter

in this last tempest I perceive these lords
at this encounter do so much admire
that they devour their reason and scarce think
their eyes do offices of truth their words
are natural breath but howsoe'er you have
been justled from your senses know for certain
that I am Prospero and that very duke
which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely
upon this shore where you were wrack'd was landed
to be the lord on't No more yet of this
for tis a chronicle of day by day
not a relation for a breakfast nor
befitting this first meeting Welcome sir
and subjects none abroad pray you look in
my dukedom since you have given me again
I will requite you with as good a thing
at least bring forth a wonder to content ye
as much as me my dukedom


sweet lord you play me false

no my dearest love
I would not for the world

yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
and I would call it fair play

if this prove
a vision of the island one dear son
shall I twice lose


though the seas threaten they are merciful
I have curs'd them without cause


now all the blessings
of a glad father compass thee about
arise and say how thou cam'st here

O wonder
how many goodly creatures are there here
how beauteous mankind is O brave new world
that has such people in't

'Tis new to thee

what is this maid with whom thou wast at play
your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours
is she the goddess that hath sever'd us

sir she is mortal
but by immortal Providence she's mine
I chose her when I could not ask my father
for his advice nor thought I had one She
is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan
of whom so often I have heard renown
but never saw before of whom I have
receiv'd a second life and second father
this lady makes him to me

I am hers
but O how oddly will it sound that I
must ask my child forgiveness

there sir stop
let us not burden our remembrances
with a heaviness that's gone

or should have spoke ere this Look down you gods
and on this couple drop a blessed crown
for it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
which brought us hither

I say Amen Gonzalo

was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue
should become kings of Naples O rejoice
beyond a common joy and set it down
with gold on lasting pillars In one voyage
did Claribel her husband find at Tunis
and Ferdinand her brother found a wife
where he himself was lost Prospero his dukedom
in a poor isle and all of us ourselves
when no man was his own

give me your hands
let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart

be it so Amen


O look sir look sir here are more of us
I prophesied if a gallows were on land
this fellow could not drown Now blasphemy
that swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore

hast thou no mouth by land What is the news

the best news is that we have safely found
our king and company the next our ship
which but three glasses since we gave out split
is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
we first put out to sea

sir all this service
have I done since I went
my tricksy spirit

these are not natural events they strengthen
from strange to stranger Say how came you hither

if I did think sir I were well awake
I'd strive to tell you We were dead of sleep
and how we know not all clapp'd under hatches
where but even now with strange and several noises
of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
and mo diversity of sounds all horrible
we were awak'd straightway at liberty
where we in all her trim freshly beheld
our royal good and gallant ship our master
capering to eye her on a trice so please you
even in a dream were we divided from them
and were brought moping hither

was't well done
bravely my diligence Thou shalt be free

this is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
and there is in this business more than nature
was ever conduct of some oracle
must rectify our knowledge

sir my liege
do not infest your mind with beating on
the strangeness of this business at pick'd leisure
which shall be shortly single I'll resolve you
which to you shall seem probable of every
these happen'd accidents till when be cheerful
and think of each thing well

come hither spirit
set Caliban and his companions free
untie the spell

there are yet missing of your company
some few odd lads that you remember not


every man shift for all the rest and let no man take care for himself for all is but fortune Coragio bully-monster Coragio

if these be true spies which I wear in my head here's a goodly sight

O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed
how fine my master is I am afraid
he will chastise me

ha ha
what things are these my lord Antonio
will money buy them

very like one of them
is a plain fish and no doubt marketable

then say if they be true This mis-shapen knave
his mother was a witch and one so strong
that could control the moon make flows and ebbs
and deal in her command without her power
these three have robb'd me and this demidevil
for he's a bastard one had plotted with them
to take my life two of these fellows you
must know and own this thing of darkness I
acknowledge mine

I shall be pinch'd to death

is not this Stephano my drunken butler

he is drunk now where had he wine

and Trinculo is reeling-ripe where should they
find this grand liquor that hath gilded them
how cam'st thou in this pickle
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I fear me will never out of my bones I shall not fear fly-blowing

why how now Stephano

O touch me not I am not Stephano but a cramp

you'd be king of the isle sirrah

I should have been a sore one then

this is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on


he is as disproportion'd in his manners As in his shape Go sirrah to my cell
take with you your companions as you look
to have my pardon trim it handsomely

ay that I will and I'll be wise hereafter
and seek for grace What a thrice-double ass
and worship this dull fool

go to away

hence and bestow your luggage where you found it

or stole it rather


sir I invite your highness and your train
to my poor cell where you shall take your rest
for this one night which part of it I'll waste
with such discourse as I not doubt shall make it
go quick away the story of my life
and the particular accidents gone by
since I came to this isle and in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples
where I have hope to see the nuptial
of these our dear-beloved solemniz'd
every third thought shall be my grave

I long
to hear the story of your life which must
take the ear strangely

I'll deliver all
and promise you calm seas auspicious gales
and sail so expeditious that shall catch
your royal fleet far off

my Ariel chick
that is thy charge then to the elements
be free and fare thou well Please you draw near

now my charms are all o'erthrown
and what strength I have's mine own
which is most faint now tis true
I must be here confin'd by you
since I have my dukedom got
and pardon'd the deceiver dwell
in this bare island by your spell
but release me from my bands
with the help of your good hands
gentle breath of yours my sails
must fill or else my project fails
which was to please Now I want
spirits to enforce art to enchant
and my ending is despair
unless I be reliev'd by prayer
which pierces so that it assaults
mercy itself and frees all faults
as you from crimes would pardon'd be
let your indulgence set me free

THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA

cease to persuade my loving Proteus
were't not affection chains thy tender days
to the sweet glances of thy honour'd love
I rather would entreat thy company
to see the wonders of the world abroad
than living dully sluggardiz'd at home
wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
but since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein
even as I would when I to love begin

wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu
think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest
some rare note-worthy object in thy travel
wish me partaker in thy happiness
when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
if ever danger do environ thee
commend thy grievance to my holy prayers
for I will be thy beadsman Valentine

and on a love-book pray for my success
upon some book I love I'll pray for thee

that's on some shallow story of deep love
how young Leander cross'd the Hellespont

that's a deep story of a deeper love
for he was more than over shoes in love

'Tis true for you are over boots in love
and yet you never swum the Hellespont

over the boots nay give me not the boots

no I will not for it boots thee not

what

to be in love where scorn is bought with groans
coy looks with heart-sore sighs one fading moment's mirth
if haply won perhaps a hapless gain
if lost why then a grievous labour won
however but a folly bought with wit
or else a wit by folly vanquished

so by your circumstance you call me fool

so by your circumstance I fear you'll prove

'Tis love you cavil at I am not Love

love is your master for he masters you
and he that is so yoked by a fool
methinks should not be chronicled for wise

yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
the eating canker dwells so eating love
inhabits in the finest wits of all

is eaten by the canker ere it blow
even so by love the young and tender wit
is turned to folly blasting in the bud
losing his verdure even in the prime
and all the fair effects of future hopes
but wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
that art a votary to fond desire
once more adieu my father at the road
expects my coming there to see me shipp'd

and thither will I bring thee Valentine

sweet Proteus no now let us take our leave
to Milan let me hear from thee by letters
of thy success in love and what news else
betideth here in absence of thy friend
and I likewise will visit thee with mine

all happiness bechance to thee in Milan
as much to you at home and so farewell


he after honour hunts I after love
he leaves his friends to dignify them more
I leave myself my friends and all for love
thou Julia thou hast metamorphos'd me
made me neglect my studies lose my time
war with good counsel set the world at nought
made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought


sir Proteus save you Saw you my master

but now he parted hence to embark for Milan

twenty to one then he is shipp'd already
and I have play'd the sheep in losing him

an if the shepherd be a while away

you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and I a sheep

I do

why then my horns are his horns whether I wake or sleep

a silly answer and fitting well a sheep

this proves me still a sheep

true and thy master a shepherd

nay that I can deny by a circumstance

it shall go hard but I'll prove it by another

the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but I seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore I am no sheep
the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep

such another proof will make me cry baa

but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to Julia

ay sir I a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labour

here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons

if the ground be overcharged you were best stick her

nay in that you are astray twere best pound you

nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter

you mistake I mean the pound a pinfold

from a pound to a pin fold it over and over

but what said she

did she nod

ay

nod ay why that's noddy

you mistook sir I say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and I say Ay

and that set together is noddy

now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your pains

no no you shall have it for bearing the letter

well I perceive I must be fain to bear with you


marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word noddy' for my pains

beshrew me but you have a quick wit

and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse

come come open the matter in brief what said she

open your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered

well sir here is for your pains

what said she

truly sir I think you'll hardly win her

why couldst thou perceive so much from her


what said she nothing

no not so much as Take this for thy pains To testify your bounty I thank you you have testerned me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself And so sir I'll commend you to my master

go go be gone to save your ship from wrack
which cannot perish having thee aboard
being destin'd to a drier death on shore

I must go send some better messenger
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines
receiving them from such a worthless post


but say Lucetta now we are alone
wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love

ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully

that every day with parle encounter me
in thy opinion which is worthiest love

please you repeat their names I'll show my mind
according to my shallow simple skill

what think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour

as of a knight well-spoken neat and fine
but were I you he never should be mine

what think'st thou of the rich Mercatio

well of his wealth but of himself so so

what think'st thou of the gentle Proteus

lord Lord to see what folly reigns in us


pardon dear madam tis a passing shame
that I unworthy body as I am
should censure thus on lovely gentlemen

why not on Proteus as of all the rest

then thus of many good I think him best

your reason

I have no other but a woman's reason
I think him so because I think him so

and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him

ay if you thought your love not cast away

why he of all the rest hath never mov'd me
yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye

his little speaking shows his love but small

fire that's closest kept burns most of all

they do not love that do not show their love

O they love least that let men know their love

I would I knew his mind

peruse this paper madam


'To Julia Say from whom

that the contents will show


sir Valentine's page and sent I think from Proteus
he would have given it you but I being in the way
did in your name receive it pardon the fault I pray

now by my modesty a goodly broker
dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
to whisper and conspire against my youth
now trust me tis an office of great worth
and you an officer fit for the place
there take the paper see it be return'd
or else return no more into my sight

to plead for love deserves more fee than hate

will ye be gone

that you may ruminate

and yet I would I had o'erlook'd the letter
it were a shame to call her back again
and pray her to a fault for which I chid her
what fool is she that knows I am a maid
and would not force the letter to my view
since maids in modesty say No' to that
which they would have the profferer construe Ay
fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
and presently all humbled kiss the rod
how churlishly I child Lucetta hence
when willingly I would have had her here
how angerly I taught my brow to frown
when inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile
my penance is to call Lucetta back
and ask remission for my folly past
what ho Lucetta



is it near dinner-time

I would it were
that you might kill your stomach on your meat
and not upon your maid

what is't that you took up so gingerly

nothing

why didst thou stoop then

to take a paper up
that I let fall

and is that paper nothing

nothing concerning me
then let it lie for those that it concerns

madam it will not lie where it concerns
unless it have a false interpreter

some love of yours hath writ to you in rime

that I might sing it madam to a tune
give me a note your ladyship can set

as little by such toys as may be possible
best sing it to the tune of Light o' Love

it is too heavy for so light a tune

heavy belike it hath some burden then

ay and melodious were it would you sing it


I cannot reach so high

let's see your song

how now minion

keep tune there still so you will sing it out
and yet methinks I do not like this tune

you do not

no madam it is too sharp

you minion are too saucy

nay now you are too flat
and mar the concord with too harsh a descant
there wanteth but a mean to fill your song
the mean is drown'd with your unruly bass

indeed I bid the base for Proteus

this babble shall not henceforth trouble me
here is a coil with protestation

go get you gone and let the papers lie
you would be fingering them to anger me

she makes it strange but she would be best pleas'd
to be so anger'd with another letter


nay would I were so anger'd with the same
O hateful hands to tear such loving words
injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
and kill the bees that yield it with your stings
I'll kiss each several paper for amends
as in revenge of thy ingratitude
I throw thy name against the bruising stones
trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
and here is writ love-wounded Proteus
poor wounded name my bosom as a bed
shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd
and thus I search it with a sovereign kiss
but twice or thrice was Proteus' written down
be calm good wind blow not a word away
till I have found each letter in the letter
except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
unto a ragged fearful hanging rock
and throw it thence into the raging sea
lo here in one line is his name twice writ
'Poor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus
to the sweet Julia' that I'll tear away
and yet I will not sith so prettily
he couples it to his complaining names
thus will I fold them one upon another


madam
dinner is ready and your father stays

well let us go

what shall these papers he like tell-tales here

if you respect them best to take them up

nay I was taken up for laying them down
yet here they shall not lie for catching cold

I see you have a month's mind to them

ay madam you may say what sights you see
I see things too although you judge I wink



tell me Panthino what sad talk was that
wherewith my brother held you in the cloister

'Twas of his nephew Proteus your son

why what of him

he wonder'd that your lordship
would suffer him to spend his youth at home
while other men of slender reputation
put forth their sons to seek preferment out
some to the wars to try their fortune there
some to discover islands far away
some to the studious universities
for any or for all these exercises
he said that Proteus your son was meet
and did request me to importune you
which would be great impeachment to his age
in having known to travel in his youth

nor need'st thou much importune me to that
whereon this month I have been hammering
I have consider'd well his loss of time
and how he cannot be a perfect man
not being tried and tutor'd in the world
experience is by industry achiev'd
and perfected by the swift course of time
then tell me whither were I best to send him

I think your lordship is not ignorant
how his companion youthful Valentine
attends the emperor in his royal court

I know it well

'Twere good I think your lordship sent him thither
hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen
and be in eye of every exercise
worthy his youth and nobleness of birth

I like thy counsel well hast thou advis'd
and that thou mayst perceive how well I like it
the execution of it shall make known
even with the speediest expedition
I will dispatch him to the emperor's court

to-morrow may it please you Don Alphonso
with other gentlemen of good esteem
are journeying to salute the emperor
and to commend their service to his will

good company with them shall Proteus go
and in good time now will we break with him


here is her hand the agent of her heart
here is her oath for love her honour's pawn
O that our fathers would applaud our loves
to seal our happiness with their consents
O heavenly Julia

how now what letter are you reading there

may't please your lordship tis a word or two
of commendations sent from Valentine
deliver'd by a friend that came from him

lend me the letter let me see what news

there is no news my lord but that he writes
how happily he lives how well belov'd
and daily graced by the emperor
wishing me with him partner of his fortune


as one relying on your lordship's will
and not depending on his friendly wish

my will is something sorted with his wish
muse not that I thus suddenly proceed
for what I will I will and there an end
I am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time
with Valentinus in the emperor's court
what maintenance he from his friends receives
like exhibition thou shalt have from me
to-morrow be in readiness to go
excuse it not for I am peremptory

my lord I cannot be so soon provided
please you deliberate a day or two

look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee
no more of stay to-morrow thou must go
to hasten on his expedition


thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning
and drench'd me in the sea where I am drown'd
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter
lest he should take exceptions to my love
and with the vantage of mine own excuse
hath he excepted most against my love
O how this spring of love resembleth
the uncertain glory of an April day
which now shows all the beauty of the sun
and by and by a cloud takes all away


sir Proteus your father calls for you
he is in haste therefore I pray you go

why this it is my heart accords thereto

sir your glove


not mine my gloves are on

why then this may be yours for this is but one

ha let me see ay give it me it's mine
sweet ornament that decks a thing divine
Ah Silvia Silvia

madam Silvia Madam Silvia

how now sirrah

she is not within hearing sir

why sir who bade you call her
your worship sir or else I mistook

well you'll still be too forward

and yet I was last chidden for being too slow

go to sir Tell me do you know Madam Silvia

she that your worship loves

why how know you that I am in love

marry by these special marks first you have learned like Sir Proteus to wreathe your arms like a malecontent to relish a love-song like a robin-redbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas You were wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walked to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you looked sadly it was for want of money and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress that when I look on you I can hardly think you my master

are all these things perceived in me

they are all perceived without ye

without me they cannot
without you nay that's certain for without you were so simple none else would but you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady

but tell me dost thou know my lady Silvia

she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper

hast thou observed that even she I mean

why sir I know her not

dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet knowest her not

is she not hard-favoured sir

not so fair boy as well-favoured

sir I know that well enough

what dost thou know
that she is not so fair as of you well-favoured

I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite

that's because the one is painted and the other out of all count

how painted and how out of count

marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts of her beauty

how esteemest thou me I account of her beauty

you never saw her since she was deformed

how long hath she been deformed

ever since you loved her

I have loved her ever since I saw her and still I see her beautiful
if you love her you cannot see her

why

because Love is blind O that you had mine eyes or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered

what should I see then

your own present folly and her passing deformity for he being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose

belike boy then you are in love for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes

true sir I was in love with my bed I thank you you swinged me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours

in conclusion I stand affected to her

I would you were set so your affection would cease

last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves
and have you

I have

are they not lamely writ

no boy but as well as I can do them
peace here she comes


O excellent motion O exceeding puppet now will he interpret to her

madam and mistress a thousand good morrows

O give ye good even here's a million of manners

sir Valentine and servant to you two thousand

he should give her interest and she gives it him
as you enjoin'd me I have writ your letter
unto the secret nameless friend of yours
which I was much unwilling to proceed in
but for my duty to your ladyship


I thank you gentle servant Tis very clerkly done

now trust me madam it came hardly off
for being ignorant to whom it goes
I writ at random very doubtfully

perchance you think too much of so much pains

no madam so it stead you I will write
please you command a thousand times as much
and yet

a pretty period Well I guess the sequel
and yet take this again and yet I thank you
meaning henceforth to trouble you no more

and yet you will and yet another yet

what means your ladyship do you not like it

yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ
but since unwillingly take them again
nay take them


madam they are for you

ay ay you writ them sir at my request
but I will none of them they are for you
I would have had them writ more movingly

please you I'll write your ladyship another
and when it's writ for my sake read it over
and if it please you so if not why so

if it please me madam what then

why if it please you take it for your labour
and so good morrow servant


O jest unseen inscrutable invisible
as a nose on a man's face or a weathercock on a steeple
my master sues to her and she hath taught her suitor
he being her pupil to become her tutor
O excellent device was there ever heard a better
that my master being scribe to himself should write the letter

how now sir what are you reasoning with yourself

nay I was riming tis you that have the reason
to do what

to be a spokesman from Madam Silvia

to whom

to yourself Why she wooes you by a figure

what figure

by a letter I should say

why she hath not writ to me

what need she when she hath made you write to yourself Why do you not perceive the jest

no believe me

no believing you indeed sir But did you perceive her earnest
she gave me none except an angry word

why she hath given you a letter

that's the letter I writ to her friend

and that letter hath she delivered and there an end

I would it were no worse

I'll warrant you tis as well
'For often have you writ to her and she in modesty
or else for want of idle time could not again reply
or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover
herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover
all this I speak in print for in print I found it
why muse you sir tis dinner-time

I have dined
ay but hearken sir though the chameleon Love can feed on the air I am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat O be not like your mistress be moved be moved


have patience gentle Julia

I must where is no remedy

when possibly I can I will return

if you turn not you will return the sooner
keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake


why then we'll make exchange here take you this


and seal the bargain with a holy kiss

here is my hand for my true constancy
wherein I sigh not Julia for thy sake
the next ensuing hour some foul mischance
torment me for my love's forgetfulness
my father stays my coming answer not
the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears
that tide will stay me longer than I should
Julia farewell

what gone without a word
ay so true love should do it cannot speak
for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it


sir Proteus you are stay'd for

go I come I come
alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb




Launce away away aboard thy master is shipped and thou art to post after with oars What's the matter why weepest thou man Away ass you'll lose the tide if you tarry any longer

it is no matter if the tied were lost for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied

what's the unkindest tide

why he that's tied here Crab my dog

tut man I mean thou'lt lose the flood and in losing the flood lose thy voyage and in losing thy voyage lose thy master and in losing thy master lose thy service and in losing thy service Why dost thou stop my mouth

for fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue

where should I lose my tongue

in thy tale

in thy tail
lose the tide and the voyage and the master and the service and the tied Why man if the river were dry I am able to fill it with my tears if the wind were down I could drive the boat with my sighs

come come away man I was sent to call thee

sir call me what thou darest

wilt thou go

well I will go


servant

mistress

master Sir Thurio frowns on you

ay boy it's for love


of my mistress then

'Twere good you knock'd him

servant you are sad

indeed madam I seem so

seem you that you are not

haply I do

so do counterfeits

so do you

what seem I that I am not


what instance of the contrary

your folly

and how quote you my folly

I quote it in your jerkin

my jerkin is a doublet

well then I'll double your folly

how

what angry Sir Thurio do you change colour

give him leave madam he is a kind of chameleon


you have said sir

ay sir and done too for this time

I know it well sir you always end ere you begin

a fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off

'Tis indeed madam we thank the giver

who is that servant

yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your company

sir if you spend word for word with me I shall make your wit bankrupt

I know it well sir you have an exchequer of words and I think no other treasure to give your followers for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words



now daughter Silvia you are hard beset
sir Valentine your father's in good health
what say you to a letter from your friends
of much good news

my lord I will be thankful
to any happy messenger from thence

know ye Don Antonio your countryman

ay my good lord I know the gentleman
to be of worth and worthy estimation
and not without desert so well reputed

hath he not a son

ay my good lord a son that well deserves

you know him well

I know him as myself for from our infancy
we have convers'd and spent our hours together
and though myself have been an idle truant
omitting the sweet benefit of time
to clothe mine age with angel-like perfection
yet hath Sir Proteus for that's his name
made use and fair advantage of his days
his years but young but his experience old
his head unmellow'd but his judgment ripe
and in a word for far behind his worth
come all the praises that I now bestow
he is complete in feature and in mind
with all good grace to grace a gentleman

beshrew me sir but if he make this good
he is as worthy for an empress' love
well sir this gentleman is come to me
with commendation from great potentates
and here he means to spend his time awhile
I think tis no unwelcome news to you

should I have wish'd a thing it had been he

welcome him then according to his worth
Silvia I speak to you and you Sir Thurio
for Valentine I need not cite him to it
I'll send him hither to you presently


this is the gentleman I told your ladyship
had come along with me but that his mistress
did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks

belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them
upon some other pawn for fealty
nay sure I think she holds them prisoners still

nay then he should be blind and being blind
how could he see his way to seek out you

why lady Love hath twenty pairs of eyes

they say that Love hath not an eye at all

to see such lovers Thurio as yourself
upon a homely object Love can wink

have done have done Here comes the gentleman


welcome dear Proteus Mistress I beseech you
confirm his welcome with some special favour

his worth is warrant for his welcome hither

mistress it is sweet lady entertain him
to be my fellow-servant to your ladyship

too low a mistress for so high a servant

not so sweet lady but too mean a servant
to have a look of such a worthy mistress

leave off discourse of disability
sweet lady entertain him for your servant

my duty will I boast of nothing else

and duty never yet did want his meed
servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress

I'll die on him that says so but yourself


that you are worthless


madam my lord your father would speak with you

I wait upon his pleasure

come Sir Thurio
go with me Once more new servant welcome
I'll leave you to confer of home-affairs
when you have done we look to hear from you

we'll both attend upon your ladyship


now tell me how do all from whence you came

your friends are well and have them much commended
and how do yours

I left them all in health

how does your lady and how thrives your love

my tales of love were wont to weary you
I know you joy not in a love-discourse

ay Proteus but that life is alter'd now
I have done penance for contemning love
whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
with bitter fasts with penitential groans
with nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs
for in revenge of my contempt of love
love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes
and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow
O gentle Proteus Love's a mighty lord
and hath so humbled me as I confess
nor to his service no such joy on earth
now no discourse except it be of love
now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep
upon the very naked name of love

enough I read your fortune in your eye
was this the idol that you worship so

even she and is she not a heavenly saint

no but she is an earthly paragon

call her divine

I will not flatter her

O flatter me for love delights in praises

when I was sick you gave me bitter pills

then speak the truth by her if not divine
yet let her be a principality
sovereign to all the creatures on the earth

except my mistress

sweet except not any
except thou wilt except against my love

have I not reason to prefer mine own

and I will help thee to prefer her too
she shall be dignified with this high honour
to bear my lady's train lest the base earth
should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
and of so great a favour growing proud
disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
and make rough winter everlastingly
why Valentine what braggardism is this

pardon me Proteus all I can is nothing
to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
she is alone

then let her alone

not for the world why man she is mine own
and I as rich in having such a jewel
as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
the water nectar and the rocks pure gold
forgive me that I do not dream on thee
because thou see'st me dote upon my love
my foolish rival that her father likes
only for his possessions are so huge
is gone with her along and I must after
for love thou know'st is full of jealousy


ay and we are betroth'd nay more our marriage-hour
with all the cunning manner of our flight
determin'd of how I must climb her window
the ladder made of cords and all the means
plotted and greed on for my happiness
good Proteus go with me to my chamber
in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel

go on before I shall inquire you forth
I must unto the road to disembark
some necessaries that I needs must use
and then I'll presently attend you

will you make haste

I will

even as one heat another heat expels
so the remembrance of my former love
is by a newer object quite forgotten
is it mine eye or Valentinus' praise
her true perfection or my false transgression
that makes me reasonless to reason thus
she's fair and so is Julia that I love
that I did love for now my love is thaw'd
which like a waxen image gainst a fire
bears no impression of the thing it was
methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold
and that I love him not as I was wont
O but I love his lady too-too much
and that's the reason I love him so little
how shall I dote on her with more advice
that thus without advice begin to love her
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld
and that hath dazzled my reason's light
but when I look on her perfections
there is no reason but I shall be blind
if not to compass her I'll use my skill


Launce by mine honesty welcome to Milan

forswear not thyself sweet youth for I am not welcome I reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say Welcome

come on you madcap I'll to the alehouse with you presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes But sirrah how did thy master part with Madam Julia

marry after they closed in earnest they parted very fairly in jest

but shall she marry him

no

how then Shall he marry her

no neither


no they are both as whole as a fish

why then how stands the matter with them

marry thus when it stands well with him it stands well with her

what an ass art thou I understand thee not

what a block art thou that thou canst not My staff understands me

what thou sayest

ay and what I do too look thee I'll but lean and my staff understands me

it stands under thee indeed

why stand-under and under-stand is all one


ask my dog if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will

the conclusion is then that it will

thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable

'Tis well that I get it so But Launce how sayest thou that my master is become a notable lover

I never knew him otherwise

than how

a notable lubber as thou reportest him to be

why thou whoreson ass thou mistakest me

why fool I meant not thee I meant thy master


why I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love If thou wilt go with me to the alehouse so if not thou art a Hebrew a Jew and not worth the name of a Christian

why

because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian Wilt thou go

at thy service


to leave my Julia shall I be forsworn
to love fair Silvia shall I be forsworn
to wrong my friend I shall be much forsworn
and even that power which gave me first my oath
provokes me to this threefold perjury
love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear
O sweet-suggesting Love if thou hast sinn'd
teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
at first I did adore a twinkling star
unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
and he wants wit that wants resolved will
to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better
fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
with twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths
I cannot leave to love and yet I do
but there I leave to love where I should love
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose
if I keep them I needs must lose myself
if I lose them thus find I by their loss
for Valentine myself for Julia Silvia
I to myself am dearer than a friend
for love is still most precious in itself
and Silvia witness heaven that made her fair
shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope
I will forget that Julia is alive
remembering that my love to her is dead
and Valentine I'll hold an enemy
I cannot now prove constant to myself
without some treachery us'd to Valentine
this night he meaneth with a corded ladder
to climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window
myself in counsel his competitor
now presently I'll give her father notice
of their disguising and pretended flight
who all enrag'd will banish Valentine
for Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
but Valentine being gone I'll quickly cross
by some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding
love lend me wings to make my purpose swift
as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift


counsel Lucetta gentle girl assist me
and e'en in kind love I do conjure thee
who art the table wherein all my thoughts
are visibly character'd and engrav'd
how with my honour I may undertake
a journey to my loving Proteus

alas the way is wearisome and long

a true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly
and when the flight is made to one so dear
of such divine perfection as Sir Proteus

better forbear till Proteus make return

O know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food
pity the dearth that I have pined in
by longing for that food so long a time
didst thou but know the inly touch of love
thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
as seek to quench the fire of love with words
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire
but qualify the fire's extreme rage
lest it should burn above the bounds of reason

the more thou damm'st it up the more it burns
the current that with gentle murmur glides
thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage
but when his fair course is not hindered
he makes sweet music with th' enamell'd stones
giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
he overtaketh in his pilgrimage
and so by many winding nooks he strays
with willing sport to the wild ocean
then let me go and hinder not my course
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
and make a pastime of each weary step
till the last step have brought me to my love
and there I'll rest as after much turmoil
a blessed soul doth in Elysium
but in what habit will you go along

not like a woman for I would prevent
the loose encounters of lascivious men
gentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds
as may beseem some well-reputed page

why then your ladyship must cut your hair

no girl I'll knit it up in silken strings
with twenty odd-conceited true-love knots
to be fantastic may become a youth
of greater time than I shall show to be

what fashion madam shall I make your breeches

that fits as well as Tell me good my lord
what compass will you wear your farthingale
why even what fashion thou best lik'st Lucetta
you must needs have them with a cod-piece madam

out out Lucetta that will be ill-favour'd

a round hose madam now's not worth a pin
unless you have a cod-piece to stick pins on

Lucetta as thou lov'st me let me have
what thou think'st meet and is most mannerly
but tell me wench how will the world repute me
for undertaking so unstaid a journey
I fear me it will make me scandaliz'd

if you think so then stay at home and go not

nay that I will not

then never dream on infamy but go
if Proteus like your journey when you come
I fear me he will scarce be pleas'd withal

that is the least Lucetta of my fear
a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
and instances of infinite of love
warrant me welcome to my Proteus

all these are servants to deceitful men

base men that use them to so base effect
but truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
his words are bonds his oaths are oracles
his love sincere his thoughts immaculate
his tears pure messengers sent from his heart
his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth

pray heaven he prove so when you come to him

now as thou lov'st me do him not that wrong
only deserve my love by loving him
and presently go with me to my chamber
to take a note of what I stand in need of
to furnish me upon my longing journey
all that is mine I leave at thy dispose
my goods my lands my reputation
only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
come answer not but to it presently
I am impatient of my tarriance

sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile
we have some secrets to confer about

now tell me Proteus what's your will with me

my gracious lord that which I would discover
the law of friendship bids me to conceal
but when I call to mind your gracious favours
done to me undeserving as I am
which else no worldly good should draw from me
know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend
this night intends to steal away your daughter
myself am one made privy to the plot
I know you have determin'd to bestow her
on Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
and should she thus be stol'n away from you
it would be much vexation to your age
thus for my duty's sake I rather chose
to cross my friend in his intended drift
than by concealing it heap on your head
a pack of sorrows which would press you down
being unprevented to your timeless grave

Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care
which to requite command me while I live
this love of theirs myself have often seen
haply when they have judg'd me fast asleep
and oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid
but fearing lest my jealous aim might err
and so unworthily disgrace the man
a rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd
I gave him gentle looks thereby to find
that which thyself hast now disclos'd to me
and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower
the key whereof myself have ever kept
and thence she cannot be convey'd away

know noble lord they have devis'd a mean
how he her chamber-window will ascend
and with a corded ladder fetch her down
for which the youthful lover now is gone
and this way comes he with it presently
where if it please you you may intercept him
but good my lord do it so cunningly
that my discovery be not aimed at
hath made me publisher of this pretence

upon mine honour he shall never know
that I had any light from thee of this

adieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming

sir Valentine whither away so fast

please it your Grace there is a messenger
that stays to bear my letters to my friends
and I am going to deliver them

be they of much import

the tenour of them doth but signify
my health and happy being at your court

nay then no matter stay with me awhile
that touch me near wherein thou must be secret
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
to match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter

I know it well my lord and sure the match
were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
cannot your Grace win her to fancy him

no trust me she is peevish sullen froward
proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
neither regarding that she is my child
nor fearing me as if I were her father
and may I say to thee this pride of hers
upon advice hath drawn my love from her
and where I thought the remnant of mine age
should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty
I now am full resolv'd to take a wife
then let her beauty be her wedding-dower
for me and my possessions she esteems not

what would your Grace have me to do in this

there is a lady of Verona here
whom I affect but she is nice and coy
and nought esteems my aged eloquence
now therefore would I have thee to my tutor
for long agone I have forgot to court
besides the fashion of the time is chang'd
how and which way I may bestow myself
to be regarded in her sun-bright eye

win her with gifts if she respect not words
dumb jewels often in their silent kind
more than quick words do move a woman's mind

but she did scorn a present that I sent her
a woman sometime scorns what best contents her
send her another never give her o'er
for scorn at first makes after-love the more
if she do frown tis not in hate of you
but rather to beget more love in you
if she do chide tis not to have you gone
for why the fools are mad if left alone
take no repulse whatever she doth say
for get you gone she doth not mean away
flatter and praise commend extol their graces
though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces
that man that hath a tongue I say is no man
if with his tongue he cannot win a woman

but she I mean is promis'd by her friends
unto a youthful gentleman of worth
and kept severely from resort of men
that no man hath access by day to her


ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe
that no man hath recourse to her by night

what lets but one may enter at her window

her chamber is aloft far from the ground
and built so shelving that one cannot climb it
without apparent hazard of his life

why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
would serve to scale another Hero's tower
so bold Leander would adventure it

now as thou art a gentleman of blood
advise me where I may have such a ladder

when would you use it pray sir tell me that
this very night for Love is like a child
that longs for every thing that he can come by

by seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder

but hark thee I will go to her alone
how shall I best convey the ladder thither

it will be light my lord that you may bear it
under a cloak that is of any length

a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn

ay my good lord

then let me see thy cloak
I'll get me one of such another length

why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
how shall I fashion me to wear a cloak
I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me

what letter is this same What's here To Silvia
and here an engine fit for my proceeding
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once

my thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly
and slaves they are to me that send them flying
O could their master come and go as lightly
himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
while I their king that thither them importune
do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them
because myself do want my servants' fortune
I curse myself for they are sent by me
that they should harbour where their lord would be

what's here
Silvia this night I will enfranchise thee

'Tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose
why Phaethon for thou art Merops' son
wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
and with thy daring folly burn the world
wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
go basc intruder overweening slave
bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
and think my patience more than thy desert
is privilege for thy departure hence
thank me for this more than for all the favours
which all too much I have bestow'd on thee
but if thou linger in my territories
longer than swiftest expedition
will give thee time to leave our royal court
by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever borc my daughter or thyself
be gone I will not hear thy vain excuse


and why not death rather than living torment
to die is to be banish'd from myself
and Silvia is myself banish'd from her
is self from self a deadly banishment
what light is light if Silvia be not seen
what joy is joy if Silvia be not by
unless it be to think that she is by
and feed upon the shadow of perfection
except I be by Silvia in the night
there is no music in the nightingale
unless I look on Silvia in the day
there is no day for me to look upon
she is my essence and I leave to be
if I be not by her fair influence
foster'd illumin'd cherish'd kept alive
I fly not death to fly his deadly doom
tarry I here I but attend on death


run boy run run and seek him out

soho soho

what seest thou

him we go to find there's not a hair on's head but tis a Valentine

Valentine

no

who then his spirit

neither

what then
nothing

can nothing speak Master shall I strike

who would'st thou strike

nothing

villain forbear

why sir I'll strike nothing I pray you

sirrah I say forbear Friend Valentine a word

my ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news
so much of bad already hath possess'd them

then in dumb silence will I bury mine
for they are harsh untuneable and bad
is Silvia dead

no Valentine

no Valentine indeed for sacred Silvia
hath she forsworn me

no Valentine

no Valentine if Silvia have forsworn me
what is your news

sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished

that thou art banished O that's the news
from hence from Silvia and from me thy friend

O I have fed upon this woe already
and now excess of it will make me surfeit

ay ay and she hath offer'd to the doom
which unrevers'd stands in effectual force
a sea of melting pearl which some call tears
those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd
with them upon her knees her humble self
wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
as if but now they waxed pale for woe
but neither bended knees pure hands held up
sad sighs deep groans nor silver-shedding tears
could penetrate her uncompassionate sire
but Valentine if he be ta'en must die
besides her intercession chaf'd him so
when she for thy repeal was suppliant
that to close prison he commanded her
with many bitter threats of biding there

no more unless the next word that thou speak'st
have some malignant power upon my life
as ending anthem of my endless dolour

cease to lament for that thou canst not help
and study help for that which thou lament'st
time is the nurse and breeder of all good
here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
besides thy staying will abridge thy life
hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that
and manage it against despairing thoughts
thy letters may be here though thou art hence
which being writ to me shall be deliver'd
even in the milk-white bosom of thy love
the time now serves not to expostulate
come I'll convey thee through the city-gate
and ere I part with thee confer at large
of all that may concern thy love-affairs
as thou lov'st Silvia though not for thyself
regard thy danger and along with me

bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate

go sirrah find him out Come Valentine

O my dear Silvia hapless Valentine


I am but a fool look you and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave but that's all one if he be but one knave He lives not now that knows me to be in love yet I am in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who tis I love and yet tis a woman but what woman I will not tell myself and yet tis a milkmaid yet tis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet tis a maid for she is her master's maid and serves for wages She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel which is much in a bare Christian

here is the catelog of her condition Imprimis She can fetch and carry Why a horse can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a jade Item She can milk look you a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands


how now Signior Launce what news with your mastership

with my master's ship why it is at sea

well your old vice still mistake the word What news then in your paper

the blackest news that ever thou heardest
why man how black

why as black as ink

let me read them

fie on thee jolthead thou canst not read

thou liest I can

I will try thee Tell me this who begot thee

marry the son of my grandfather

O illiterate loiterer it was the son of thy grandmother This proves that thou canst not read

come fool come try me in thy paper

there and Saint Nicholas be thy speed
Imprimis She can milk

ay that she can

Item She brews good ale

and thereof comes the proverb Blessing of your heart you brew good ale

Item She can sew

that's as much as to say Can she so

Item She can knit

what need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can knit him a stock

Item She can wash and scour

a special virtue for then she need not be washed and scoured
Item She can spin

then may I set the world on wheels when she can spin for her living

Item She hath many nameless virtues

that's as much as to say bastard virtues that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names

here follow her vices

close at the heels of her virtues

Item She is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breath

well that fault may be mended with a breakfast Read on

Item She hath a sweet mouth

that makes amends for her sour breath
Item She doth talk in her sleep

it's no matter for that so she sleep not in her talk

Item She is slow in words

O villain that set this down among her vices To be slow in words is a woman's only virtue I pray thee out with't and place it for her chief virtue

Item She is proud

out with that too it was Eve's legacy and cannot be ta'en from her

Item She hath no teeth

I care not for that neither because I love crusts

Item She is curst

well the best is she hath no teeth to bite
Item She will often praise her liquor

if her liquor be good she shall if she will not I will for good things should be praised

Item She is too liberal

of her tongue she cannot for that's writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that I'll keep shut now of another thing she may and that cannot I help Well proceed

Item She hath more hair than wit and more faults than hairs and more wealth than faults

stop there I'll have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article Rehearse that once more

Item She hath more hair than wit

more hair than wit it may be I'll prove it the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the greater hides the less What's next

and more faults than hairs

that's monstrous O that that were out
and more wealth than faults

why that word makes the faults gracious Well I'll have her and if it be a match as nothing is impossible

what then

why then will I tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the North-gate

for me

for thee ay who art thou he hath stayed for a better man than thee

and must I go to him

thou must run to him for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn

why didst not tell me sooner pox of your love-letters




sir Thurio fear not but that she will love you
now Valentine is banish'd from her sight

since his exile she hath despis'd me most
forsworn my company and rail'd at me
that I am desperate of obtaining her

this weak impress of love is as a figure
trenched in ice which with an hour's heat
dissolves to water and doth lose his form
a little time will melt her frozen thoughts
and worthless Valentine shall be forgot


how now Sir Proteus Is your countryman

according to our proclamation gone
gone my good lord

my daughter takes his going grievously

a little time my lord will kill that grief

so I believe but Thurio thinks not so
Proteus the good conceit I hold of thee
for thou hast shown some sign of good desert
makes me the better to confer with thee

longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
let me not live to look upon your Grace

thou know'st how willingly I would effect
the match between Sir Thurio and my daughter

I do my lord

how she opposes her against my will

she did my lord when Valentine was here

ay and perversely she persevers so
what might we do to make the girl forget
the love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio

the best way is to slander Valentine
with falsehood cowardice and poor descent
three things that women highly hold in hate

ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate

ay if his enemy deliver it
therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
by one whom she esteemeth as his friend

then you must undertake to slander him
and that my lord I shall be loath to do
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman
especially against his very friend

where your good word cannot advantage him
your slander never can endamage him
therefore the office is indifferent
being entreated to it by your friend

you have prevail'd my lord If I can do it
by aught that I can speak in his dispraise
she shall not long continue love to him
but say this weed her love from Valentine
it follows not that she will love Sir Thurio

therefore as you unwind her love from him
lest it should ravel and be good to none
you must provide to bottom it on me
which must be done by praising me as much

and Proteus we dare trust you in this kind
because we know on Valentine's report
you are already Love's firm votary
and cannot soon revolt and change your mind
upon this warrant shall you have access
where you with Silvia may confer at large
for she is lumpish heavy melancholy
and for your friend's sake will be glad of you
where you may temper her by your persuasion
to hate young Valentine and love my friend

as much as I can do I will effect
but you Sir Thurio are not sharp enough
you must lay lime to tangle her desires
by wailful sonnets whose composed rimes
should be full-fraught with serviceable vows

ay

say that upon the altar of her beauty
you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
write till your ink be dry and with your tears
moist it again and frame some feeling line
that may discover such integrity
for Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews
whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
make tigers tame and huge leviathans
forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
after your dire-lamenting elegies
visit by night your lady's chamber-window
with some sweet consort to their instruments
tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence
will well become such sweet-complaining grievance
this or else nothing will inherit her

this discipline shows thou hast been in love

therefore sweet Proteus my direction-giver
let us into the city presently
to sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
to give the onset to thy good advice

about it gentlemen

we'll wait upon your grace till aftersupper
and afterward determine our proceedings

even now about it I will pardon you

fellows stand fast I see a passenger

if there be ten shrink not but down with em


stand sir and throw us that you have about ye

sir we are undone these are the villains
that all the travellers do fear so much

my friends

that's not so sir we are your enemies

peace we'll hear him

ay by my beard will we for he is a proper man

then know that I have little wealth to lose
a man I am cross'd with adversity
my riches are these poor habiliments
of which if you should here disfurnish me
you take the sum and substance that I have

whither travel you
to Verona

whence came you

from Milan

have you long sojourn'd there

some sixteen months and longer might have stay'd
if crooked fortune had not thwarted me

what were you banish'd thence

I was

for what offence

for that which now torments me to rehearse
I kill'd a man whose death I much repent
without false vantage or base treachery

why ne'er repent it if it were done so
but were you banish'd for so small a fault

I was and held me glad of such a doom

have you the tongues

my youthful travel therein made me happy
or else I often had been miserable

by the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar
this fellow were a king for our wild faction

we'll have him Sirs a word

master be one of them
it is an honourable kind of thievery
peace villain

tell us this have you anything to take to

nothing but my fortune

know then that some of us are gentlemen
such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
thrust from the company of awful men
myself was from Verona banished
for practising to steal away a lady
an heir and near allied unto the duke

and I from Mantua for a gentleman
who in my mood I stabb'd unto the heart

and I for such like petty crimes as these
but to the purpose for we cite our faults
that they may hold excus'd our lawless lives
with goodly shape and by your own report
a linguist and a man of such perfection
as we do in our quality much want

indeed because you are a banish'd man
therefore above the rest we parley to you
are you content to be our general
to make a virtue of necessity
and live as we do in this wilderness

what say'st thou wilt thou be of our consort
say ay and be the captain of us all
we'll do thee homage and be rul'd by thee
love thee as our commander and our king

but if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest

thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd

provided that you do no outrages
on silly women or poor passengers

no we detest such vile base practices
come go with us we'll bring thee to our crews
and show thee all the treasure we have got
which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose


already have I been false to Valentine
and now I must be as unjust to Thurio
under the colour of commending him
I have access my own love to prefer
but Silvia is too fair too true too holy
to be corrupted with my worthless gifts
when I protest true loyalty to her
she twits me with my falsehood to my friend
when to her beauty I commend my vows
she bids me think how I have been forsworn
and notwithstanding all her sudden quips
the least whereof would quell a lover's hope
yet spaniel-like the more she spurns my love
the more it grows and fawneth on her still
but here comes Thurio now must we to her window
and give some evening music to her ear


how now Sir Proteus are you crept before us

ay gentle Thurio for you know that love
will creep in service where it cannot go

ay but I hope sir that you love not here

sir but I do or else I would be hence

who Silvia


I thank you for your own Now gentlemen
let's tune and to it lustily a while


now my young guest methinks you're allycholly I pray you why is it

marry mine host because I cannot be merry

come we'll have you merry I'll bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for

but shall I hear him speak

ay that you shall

that will be music


hark hark
is he among these

ay but peace let's hear em


who is Silvia what is she
that all our swains commend her
holy fair and wise is she
the heaven such grace did lend her
that she might admired be
is she kind as she is fair
for beauty lives with kindness
love doth to her eyes repair
to help him of his blindness
and being help'd inhabits there
then to Silvia let us sing
that Silvia is excelling
she excels each mortal thing
upon the dull earth dwelling

how now are you sadder than you were before How do you man the music likes you not

you mistake the musician likes me not

why my pretty youth

he plays false father

how out of tune on the strings

not so but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-strings

you have a quick ear

ay I would I were deaf it makes me have a slow heart

I perceive you delight not in music


hark what fine change is in the music

ay that change is the spite

you would have them always play but one thing

I would always have one play but one thing
but host doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
often resort unto this gentlewoman

I will tell you what Launce his man told me he lov'd her out of all nick

where is Launce

gone to seek his dog which to-morrow by his master's command he must carry for a present to his lady

peace stand aside the company parts

that you shall say my cunning drift excels

where meet we

at Saint Gregory's well

farewell

madam good even to your ladyship

I thank you for your music gentlemen
who is that that spake

one lady if you knew his pure heart's truth
you would quickly learn to know him by his voice

sir Proteus as I take it

sir Proteus gentle lady and your servant
what is your will

that I may compass yours

you have your wish my will is even this
that presently you hie you home to bed
thou subtle perjur'd false disloyal man
think'st thou I am so shallow so conceitless
to be seduced by thy flattery
that hast deceiv'd so many with thy vows
return return and make thy love amends
for me by this pale queen of night I swear
I am so far from granting thy request
that I despise thee for thy wrongful suit
and by and by intend to chide myself
even for this time I spend in talking to thee

I grant sweet love that I did love a lady
but she is dead
'Tware false if I should speak it
for I am sure she is not buried

say that she be yet Valentine thy friend
survives to whom thyself art witness
I am betroth'd and art thou not asham'd
to wrong him with thy importunacy

I likewise hear that Valentine is dead

and so suppose am I for in his grave Assure thyself my love is buried

sweet lady let me rake it from the earth

go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence
or at the least in hers sepulchre thine

he heard not that

vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
the picture that is hanging in your chamber
to that I'll speak to that I'll sigh and weep
for since the substance of your perfect self
is else devoted I am but a shadow
and to your shadow will I make true love

if twere a substance you would sure deceive it
and make it but a shadow as I am

I am very loath to be your idol sir
but since your falsehood shall become you well
to worship shadows and adore false shapes
send to me in the morning and I'll send it
and so good rest

as wretches have o'er night
that wait for execution in the morn

host will you go

by my halidom I was fast asleep

pray you where lies Sir Proteus

marry at my house Trust me I think tis almost day

not so but it hath been the longest night
that e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest


this is the hour that Madam Silvia
entreated me to call and know her mind
there's some great matter she'd employ me in
madam Madam


who calls
your servant and your friend
one that attends your ladyship's command

sir Eglamour a thousand times good morrow

as many worthy lady to yourself
according to your ladyship's impose
I am thus early come to know what service
it is your pleasure to command me in

O Eglamour thou art a gentleman
think not I flatter for I swear I do not
valiant wise remorseful well-accomplish'd
thou art not ignorant what dear good will
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine
nor how my father would enforce me marry
vain Thurio whom my very soul abhors
thyself hast lov'd and I have heard thee say
no grief did ever come so near thy heart
upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity
sir Eglamour I would to Valentine
to Mantua where I hear he makes abode
and for the ways are dangerous to pass
I do desire thy worthy company
upon whose faith and honour I repose
urge not my father's anger Eglamour
but think upon my grief a lady's grief
and on the justice of my flying hence
to keep me from a most unholy match
which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
I do desire thee even from a heart
as full of sorrows as the sea of sands
to bear me company and go with me
if not to hide what I have said to thee
that I may venture to depart alone

madam I pity much your grievances
which since I know they virtuously are plac'd
recking as little what betideth me
as much I wish all good befortune you
when will you go

this evening coming

where shall I meet you

at Friar Patrick's cell
where I intend holy confession

I will not fail your ladyship
good morrow gentle lady

good morrow kind Sir Eglamour


when a man's servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard one that I brought up of a puppy one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it I have taught him even as one would say precisely Thus would I teach a dog I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg O tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hanged for't sure as I live he had suffered for't you shall judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the duke's table he had not been there bless the mark a pissing-while but all the chamber smelt him Out with the dog says one What cur is that says another Whip him out says the third Hang him up says the duke I having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs Friend quoth I you mean to whip the dog Ay marry do I quoth he You do him the more wrong quoth I twas I did the thing you wot of He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber How many masters would do this for his servant Nay I'll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had been executed I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed otherwise he had suffered for't thou thinkest not of this now Nay I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale Didst thou ever see me do such a trick

Sebastian is thy name I like thee well
and will employ thee in some service presently

in what you please I will do what I can

I hope thou wilt

how now you whoreson peasant
where have you been these two days loitering

marry sir I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me

and what says she to my little jewel

marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present

but she received my dog

no indeed did she not here have I brought him back again
what didst thou offer her this from me

ay sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the marketplace and then I offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift the greater

go get thee hence and find my dog again
or ne'er return again into my sight
away I say Stay'st thou to vex me here
a slave that still an end turns me to shame

Sebastian I have entertained thee
partly that I have need of such a youth
that can with some discretion do my business
for't is no trusting to yond foolish lout
but chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour
which if my augury deceive me not
witness good bringing up fortune and truth
therefore know thou for this I entertain thee
go presently and take this ring with thee
deliver it to Madam Silvia

it seems you lov'd not her to leave her token
she's dead belike

not so I think she lives

alas

why dost thou cry alas

I cannot choose
but pity her

wherefore should'st thou pity her

because methinks that she lov'd you as well
as you do love your lady Silvia
she dreams on him that has forgot her love
you dote on her that cares not for your love
and thinking on it makes me cry alas

well well give her that ring and therewithal
this letter that's her chamber Tell my lady
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture
your message done hie home unto my chamber
where thou shalt find me sad and solitary


how many women would do such a message
alas poor Proteus thou hast entertain'd
a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
alas poor fool why do I pity him
that with his very heart despiseth me
because he loves her he despiseth me
because I love him I must pity him
this ring I gave him when he parted from me
to bind him to remember my good will
and now am I unhappy messenger
to carry that which I would have refus'd
to praise his faith which I would have disprais'd
I am my master's true-confirmed love
but cannot be true servant to my master
unless I prove false traitor to myself
yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly
as heaven it knows I would not have him speed


gentlewoman good day I pray you be my mean

to bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia

what would you with her if that I be she

if you be she I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on

from whom


O he sends you for a picture

ay madam

Ursula bring my picture there

go give your master this tell him from me
one Julia that his changing thoughts forget
would better fit his chamber than this shadow

madam please you peruse this letter
pardon me madam I have unadvis'd
deliver'd you a paper that I should not
this is the letter to your ladyship

I pray thee let me look on that again

it may not be good madam pardon me
there hold
I will not look upon your master's lines
I know they are stuff'd with protestations
and full of new-found oaths which he will break
as easily as I do tear his paper

madam he sends your ladyship this ring

the more shame for him that he sends it me
for I have heard him say a thousand times
his Julia gave it him at his departure
though his false finger have profan'd the ring
mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong

she thanks you

what say'st thou

I thank you madam that you tender her

dost thou know her

almost as well as I do know myself
to think upon her woes I do protest
that I have wept a hundred several times

belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her

I think she doth and that's her cause of sorrow

is she not passing fair

she hath been fairer madam than she is
when she did think my master lov'd her well
she in my judgment was as fair as you
but since she did neglect her looking-glass
and threw her sun-expelling mask away
the air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks
that now she is become as black as I

how tall was she

about my stature for at Pentecost
when all our pageants of delight were play'd
our youth got me to play the woman's part
and I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown
which served me as fit by all men's judgments
as if the garment had been made for me
therefore I know she is about my height
and at that time I made her weep agood
for I did play a lamentable part
madam twas Ariadne passioning
for Theseus' perjury and unjust flight
which I so lively acted with my tears
that my poor mistress moved therewithal
wept bitterly and would I might be dead
if I in thought felt not her very sorrow
she is beholding to thee gentle youth
alas poor lady desolate and left
I weep myself to think upon thy words
here youth there is my purse I give thee this
for thy sweet mistress' sake because thou lov'st her
farewell

and she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her

a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
I hope my master's suit will be but cold
since she respects my mistress' love so much
alas how love can trifle with itself
here is her picture let me see I think
if I had such a tire this face of mine
were full as lovely as is this of hers
and yet the painter flatter'd her a little
unless I flatter with myself too much
her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig
her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high
what should it be that he respects in her
but I can make respective in myself
if this fond Love were not a blinded god
come shadow come and take this shadow up
for tis thy rival O thou senseless form
thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd lov'd and ador'd
and were there sense in his idolatry
my substance should be statue in thy stead
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake
that us'd me so or else by Jove I vow
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
to make my master out of love with thee

the sun begins to gild the western sky
and now it is about the very hour
that Silvia at Friar Patrick's cell should meet me
unless it be to come before their time
so much they spur their expedition
see where she comes

lady a happy evening

amen amen go on good Eglamour
out at the postern by the abbey-wall
I fear I am attended by some spies

fear not the forest is not three leagues off
if we recover that we're sure enough


sir Proteus what says Silvia to my suit

O sir I find her milder than she was
and yet she takes exceptions at your person


no that it is too little

I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder

but love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes

what says she to my face

she says it is a fair one

nay then the wanton lies my face is black

but pearls are fair and the old saying is
'Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes

'Tis true such pearls as put out ladies' eyes
for I had rather wink than look on them


ill when you talk of war

but well when I discourse of love and peace

but better indeed when you hold your peace

what says she to my valour

O sir she makes no doubt of that

she needs not when she knows it cowardice

what says she to my birth

that you are well deriv'd

true from a gentleman to a fool


O ay and pities them

wherefore

that such an ass should owe them

that they are out by lease

here comes the duke


how now Sir Proteus how now Thurio
which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late

not I

nor I


neither

why then
she's fled unto that peasant Valentine
and Eglamour is in her company
'Tis true for Friar Laurence met them both
as he in penance wander'd through the forest
him he knew well and guess'd that it was she
but being mask'd he was not sure of it
besides she did intend confession
at Patrick's cell this even and there she was not
these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
therefore I pray you stand not to discourse
but mount you presently and meet with me
upon the rising of the mountain-foot
that leads towards Mantua whither they are fled
dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me

why this it is to be a peevish girl
that flies her fortune when it follows her
I'll after more to be reveng'd on Eglamour
than for the love of reckless Silvia


and I will follow more for Silvia's love
than hate of Eglamour that goes with her


and I will follow more to cross that love
than hate for Silvia that is gone for love


come come
be patient we must bring you to our captain

a thousand more mischances than this one
have learn'd me how to brook this patiently
come bring her away

where is the gentleman that was with her

being nimble-footed he hath outrun us
but Moyses and Valerius follow him
go thou with her to the west end of the wood
there is our captain We'll follow him that's fled
the thicket is beset he cannot scape


come I must bring you to our captain's cave
fear not he bears an honourable mind
and will not use a woman lawlessly

O Valentine this I endure for thee


how use doth breed a habit in a man
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns
here can I sit alone unseen of any
and to the nightingale's complaining notes
tune my distresses and record my woes
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast
leave not the mansion so long tenantless
lest growing ruinous the building fall
and leave no memory of what it was
repair me with thy presence Silvia
thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain

what halloing and what stir is this to-day
these are my mates that make their wills their law
have some unhappy passenger in chase
they love me well yet I have much to do
to keep them from uncivil outrages
withdraw thee Valentine who's this comes here

madam this service I have done for you
to hazard life and rescue you from him
that would have forc'd your honour and your love
vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
a smaller boon than this I cannot beg
and less than this I am sure you cannot give

how like a dream is this I see and hear
love lend me patience to forbear awhile

O miserable unhappy that I am

unhappy were you madam ere I came
but by my coming I have made you happy

by thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy

and me when he approacheth to your presence

had I been seized by a hungry lion
rather than have false Proteus rescue me
O heaven be judge how I love Valentine
whose life's as tender to me as my soul
and full as much for more there cannot be
I do detest false perjur'd Proteus
therefore be gone solicit me no more

what dangerous action stood it next to death
would I not undergo for one calm look
O tis the curse in love and still approv'd
when women cannot love where they're belov'd

when Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd
read over Julia's heart thy first best love
for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
descended into perjury to love me
thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two
and that's far worse than none better have none
thou counterfeit to thy true friend

in love
who respects friend

all men but Proteus

nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
can no way change you to a milder form
I'll woo you like a soldier at arms' end
and love you gainst the nature of love force ye

O heaven

I'll force thee yield to my desire

ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
thou friend of an ill fashion


thou common friend that's without faith or love
for such is a friend now treach'rous man
thou hast beguil'd my hopes naught but mine eye
could have persuaded me Now I dare not say
I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
who should be trusted now when one's right hand
is perjur'd to the bosom Proteus
I am sorry I must never trust thee more
but count the world a stranger for thy sake
the private wound is deep'st O time most curst
'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst

my shame and guilt confound me
forgive me Valentine If hearty sorrow
be a sufficient ransom for offence
I tender't here I do as truly suffer
as e'er I did commit

and once again I do receive thee honest
who by repentance is not satisfied
is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleas'd
by penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeas'd
and that my love may appear plain and free
all that was mine in Silvia I give thee

O me unhappy


look to the boy

why boy why wag how now what's the matter
look up speak

O good sir my master charg'd me
to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia
which out of my neglect was never done


here tis this is it


how let me see
why this is the ring I gave to Julia

O cry you mercy sir I have mistook
this is the ring you sent to Silvia


but how cam'st thou by this ring
at my depart I gave this unto Julia

and Julia herself did give it me
and Julia herself hath brought it hither

how Julia

and entertain'd them deeply in her heart
how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
O Proteus let this habit make thee blush
be thou asham'd that I have took upon me
such an immodest raiment if shame live
in a disguise of love
it is the lesser blot modesty finds
women to change their shapes than men their minds

than men their minds tis true O heaven were man
but constant he were perfect that one error
fills him with faults makes him run through all the sins
inconstancy falls off ere it begins
what is in Silvia's face but I may spy
more fresh in Julia's with a constant eye

come come a hand from either
let me be blest to make this happy close
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes
bear witness heaven I have my wish for ever

and I mine


a prize a prize a prize

forbear forbear I say it is my lord the duke
your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd
banished Valentine

sir Valentine

yonder is Silvia and Silvia's mine

Thurio give back or else embrace thy death
come not within the measure of my wrath
do not name Silvia thine if once again
Verona shall not hold thee Here she stands
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love

sir Valentine I care not for her I
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
his body for a girl that loves him not
I claim her not and therefore she is thine

the more degenerate and base art thou
to make such means for her as thou hast done
and leave her on such slight conditions
now by the honour of my ancestry
I do applaud thy spirit Valentine
and think thee worthy of an empress' love
know then I here forget all former griefs
cancel all grudge repeal thee home again
plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit
to which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine
thou art a gentleman and well deriv'd
take thou thy Silvia for thou hast deserv'd her
I thank your Grace the gift hath made me happy
I now beseech you for your daughter's sake
to grant one boon that I shall ask of you

I grant it for thine own whate'er it be

these banish'd men that I have kept withal
are men endu'd with worthy qualities
forgive them what they have committed here
and let them be recall'd from their exile
they are reformed civil full of good
and fit for great employment worthy lord

thou hast prevail'd I pardon them and thee
dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts
come let us go we will include all jars
with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity

and as we walk along I dare be bold
what think you of this page my lord

I think the boy hath grace in him he blushes

I warrant you my lord more grace than boy

what mean you by that saying

please you I'll tell you as we pass along
that you will wonder what hath fortuned
come Proteus tis your penance but to hear
the story of your loves discovered
that done our day of marriage shall be yours
one feast one house one mutual happiness

THE WINTERS TALE

if you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as I have said great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia


wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed

beseech you

verily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we cannot with such magnificence in so rare I know not what to say We will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot praise us as little accuse us

you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely

believe me I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance

Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia They were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds The heavens continue their loves

I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamilhus it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note

I very well agree with you in the hopes of him It is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man

would they else be content to die


if the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one


nine changes of the watery star have been
the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
without a burden time as long again
would be fill'd up my brother with our thanks
and yet we should for perpetuity
go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher
yet standing in rich place I multiply
with one We thank you' many thousands moe
that go before it

stay your thanks awhile
and pay them when you part

sir that's to-morrow
I am question'd by my fears of what may chance
no sneaping winds at home to make us say
'This is put forth too truly Besides I have stay'd
to tire your royalty

we are tougher brother
than you can put us to't

no longer stay

one seven-night longer

very sooth to-morrow

we'll part the time between's then and in that
I'll no gainsaying

press me not beseech you so
there is no tongue that moves none none i' the world
so soon as yours could win me so it should now
'Twere needful I denied it My affairs
do even drag me homeward which to hinder
were in your love a whip to me my stay
to you a charge and trouble to save both
farewell our brother

tongue-tied our queen speak you

I had thought sir to have held my peace until
you had drawn oaths from him not to stay
you sir
charge him too coldly tell him you are sure
all in Bohemia's well this satisfaction
the by-gone day proclaim'd say this to him
he's beat from his best ward

well said Hermione

to tell he longs to see his son were strong
but let him swear so and he shall not stay
we'll thwack him hence with distaffs


yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
the borrow of a week When at Bohemia
you take my lord I'll give him my commission
to let him there a month behind the gest
prefix'd for's parting yet good deed Leontes
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
what lady she her lord You'll stay

no madam

nay but you will

I may not verily

verily
though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths
should yet say Sir no going Verily
you shall not go a lady's verily' s
as potent as a lord's Will you go yet
force me to keep you as a prisoner
not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
when you depart and save your thanks How say you
my prisoner or my guest by your dread verily
one of them you shall be

your guest then madam
to be your prisoner should import offending
which is for me less easy to commit
than you to punish

not your gaoler then
but your kind hostess Come I'll question you
of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys
you were pretty lordings then
we were fair queen
two lads that thought there was no more behind
but such a day to-morrow as to-day
and to be boy eternal

was not my lord the verier wag o' the two

we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun
and bleat the one at the other what we chang'd
was innocence for innocence we knew not
the doctrine of ill-doing no nor dream'd
that any did Had we pursu'd that life
and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
with stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven
boldly not guilty the imposition clear'd
hereditary ours

by this we gather
you have tripp'd since
O my most sacred lady
temptations have since then been born to's for
in those unfledg'd days was my wife a girl
your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
of my young playfellow

Grace to boot
of this make no conclusion lest you say
your queen and I are devils yet go on
the offences we have made you do we'll answer
if you first sinn'd with us and that with us
you did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
with any but with us

is he won yet

he'll stay my lord

at my request he would not
to better purpose

never

never but once

what have I twice said well when was't before
I prithee tell me cram's with praise and make's
as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless
slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
our praises are our wages you may ride's
with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
with spur we heat an acre But to the goal
my last good deed was to entreat his stay
what was my first it has an elder sister
or I mistake you O would her name were Grace
but once before I spoke to the purpose when
nay let me have't I long

three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death
ere I could make thee open thy white hand
and clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
'I am yours for ever

'Tis grace indeed
why lo you now I have spoke to the purpose twice
the one for ever earn'd a royal husband
the other for some while a friend


too hot too hot
to mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
I have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
but not for joy not joy This entertainment
may a free face put on derive a liberty
from heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
and well become the agent t may I grant
but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
as in a looking-glass and then to sigh as twere
the mort o' the deer O that is entertainment
my bosom likes not nor my brows Mamillius
art thou my boy

ay my good lord

i' fecks
why that's my bawcock What hast smutch'd thy nose
they say it is a copy out of mine Come captain
we must be neat not neat but cleanly captain
and yet the steer the heifer and the calf
are all call'd neat Still virginalling
upon his palm How now you wanton calf
art thou my calf

yes if you will my lord

thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have
almost as like as eggs women say so
that will say anything but were they false
as o'er-dy'd blacks as wind as waters false
as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
no bourn twixt his and mine yet were it true
to say this boy were like me Come sir page
look on me with your wolkin eye sweet villain
most dear'st my collop Can thy dam may't be
affection thy intention stabs the centre
thou dost make possible things not so held
communicat'st with dreams how can this be
with what's unreal thou co-active art
and fellow'st nothing then tis very credent
thou mayst co-join with something and thou dost
and that beyond commission and I find it
and that to the infection of my brains
and hardening of my brows

what means Sicilia
he something seems unsettled

how my lord
what cheer how is't with you best brother

you look
as if you held a brow of much distraction
are you mov'd my lord

no in good earnest
how sometimes nature will betray its folly
its tenderness and make itself a pastime
to harder bosoms Looking on the lines
of my boy's face methoughts I did recoil
twenty-three years and saw myself unbreech'd
in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled
lest it should bite its master and so prove
as ornaments oft do too dangerous
how like methought I then was to this kernel
will you take eggs for money

no my lord I'll fight

you will why happy man be his dole My brother
are you so fond of your young prince as we
do seem to be of ours

if at home sir
he's all my exercise my mirth my matter
now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
my parasite my soldier statesman all
he makes a July's day short as December
and with his varying childness cures in me
thoughts that would thick my blood

so stands this squire
offic'd with me We two will walk my lord
and leave you to your graver steps Hermione
let what is dear in Sicily be cheap
next to thyself and my young rover he's
apparent to my heart

if you would seek us
we are yours i' the garden shall's attend you there

to your own bents dispose you you'll be found
be you beneath the sky

I am angling now
though you perceive me not how I give line
go to go to
how she holds up the neb the bill to him
and arms her with the boldness of a wife
to her allowing husband

gone already
inch-thick knee-deep o'er head and ears a fork'd one
play too but so disgrac'd a part whose issue
will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour
will be my knell Go play boy play There have been
or I am much deceiv'd cuckolds ere now
and many a man there is even at this present
now while I speak this holds his wife by the arm
that little thinks she has been sluic'd in's absence
and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by
sir Smile his neighbour nay there's comfort in't
whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd
as mine against their will Should all despair
that have revolted wives the tenth of mankind
would hang themselves Physic for't there is none
it is a bawdy planet that will strike
where tis predominant and tis powerful think it
from east west north and south be it concluded
no barricado for a belly know't
it will let in and out the enemy
with bag and baggage Many a thousand on's

I am like you they say

why that's some comfort
what Camillo there

ay my good lord

go play Mamillius thou'rt an honest man

Camillo this great sir will yet stay longer

you had much ado to make his anchor hold
when you cast out it still came home

didst note it

he would not stay at your petitions made
his business more material
didst perceive it


they're here with me already whispering rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth Tis far gone
when I shall gust it last How came't Camillo
that he did stay

at the good queen's entreaty

at the queen's be't good' should be pertinent
but so it is it is not Was this taken
by any understanding pate but thine
for thy conceit is soaking will draw in
more than the common blocks not noted is't
but of the finer natures by some severals
of head-piece extraordinary lower messes
perchance are to this business purblind say

Bohemia stays here longer

ha

stays here longer

ay but why

to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
of our most gracious mistress

satisfy
the entreaties of your mistress satisfy
let that suffice I have trusted thee Camillo
with all the nearest things to my heart as well
my chamber-councils wherein priest-like thou
hast cleans'd my bosom I from thee departed
thy penitent reform'd but we have been
deceiv'd in thy integrity deceiv'd

be it forbid my lord

to bide upon t thou art not honest or
if thou inclin'st that way thou art a coward
which hoxes honesty behind restraining
from course requir'd or else thou must be counted
a servant grafted in my serious trust
and therein negligent or else a fool
that seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn
and tak'st it all for jest

my gracious lord
I may be negligent foolish and fearful
in every one of these no man is free
but that his negligence his folly fear
among the infinite doings of the world
sometime puts forth In your affairs my lord
if ever I were wilful-negligent
I play'd the fool it was my negligence
not weighing well the end if ever fearful
to do a thing where I the issue doubted
whereof the execution did cry out
against the non-performance twas a fear
which oft infects the wisest these my lord
are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
is never free of but beseech your Grace
be plainer with me let me know my trespass
by its own visage if I then deny it
'Tis none of mine

ha' not you seen Camillo
but that's past doubt you have or your eyeglass
is thicker than a cuckold's horn or heard
for to a vision so apparent rumour
cannot be mute or thought for cogitation
resides not in that man that does not think
my wife is slippery If thou wilt confess
to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
my wife's a hobby-horse deserves a name
as rank as any flax-wench that puts to
before her troth-plight say't and justify't

I would not be a stander-by to hear
my sovereign mistress clouded so without
my present vengeance taken shrew my heart
you never spoke what did become you less
than this which to reiterate were sin
as deep as that though true

is whispering nothing
is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses
kissing with inside lip stopping the career
of laughter with a sigh a note infallible
of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot
skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
that would unseen be wicked is this nothing
why then the world and all that's in't is nothing
the covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothing
my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
if this be nothing

good my lord be cur'd
of this diseas'd opinion and betimes
for tis most dangerous

say it be tis true

no no my lord

it is you lie you lie
I say thou liest Camillo and I hate thee
pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
or else a hovering temporizer that
canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
infected as her life she would not live
the running of one glass

who does infect her

why he that wears her like her medal hanging
about his neck Bohemia who if I
had servants true about me that bare eyes
to see alike mine honour as their profits
their own particular thrifts they would do that
which should undo more doing ay and thou
his cup-bearer whom I from meaner form
have bench'd and rear'd to worship who mayst see
plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
how I am galled mightst bespice a cup
to give mine enemy a lasting wink
which draught to me were cordial

sir my lord
but with a lingering dram that should not work
maliciously like poison but I cannot
believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
so sovereingly being honourable
I have lov'd thee

make that thy question and go rot
dost think I am so muddy so unsettled
to appoint myself in this vexation sully
the purity and whiteness of my sheets
which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son
who I do think is mine and love as mine
without ripe moving to't Would I do this
could man so blench

I must believe you sir
I do and will fetch off Bohemia for't
will take again your queen as yours at first
even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing
the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
known and allied to yours

thou dost advise me
even so as I mine own course have set down
I'll give no blemish to her honour none

my lord
go then and with a countenance as clear
as friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia
and with your queen I am his cupbearer
if from me he have wholesome beverage
account me not your servant

this is all
do't and thou hast the one half of my heart
do't not thou split'st thine own
I'll do't my lord

I will seem friendly as thou hast advis'd me


O miserable lady But for me
what case stand I in I must be the poisoner
of good Polixenes and my ground to do't
is the obedience to a master one
who in rebellion with himself will have
all that are his so too To do this deed
promotion follows If I could find example
of thousands that had struck anointed kings
and flourish'd after I'd not do't but since
nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
let villany itself forswear't I must
forsake the court to do't or no is certain
to me a break-neck Happy star reign now
here comes Bohemia

this is strange methinks
my favour here begins to warp Not speak
good day Camillo

hail most royal sir

what is the news i' the court

none rare my lord

the king hath on him such a countenance
as he had lost some province and a region
lov'd as he loves himself even now I met him
with customary compliment when he
wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
a lip of much contempt speeds from me and
so leaves me to consider what is breeding
that changes thus his manners
I dare not know my lord

how dare not do not Do you know and dare not
be intelligent to me Tis thereabouts
for to yourself what you do know you must
and cannot say you dare not Good Camillo
your chang'd complexions are to me a mirror
which shows me mine chang'd too for I must be
a party in this alteration finding
myself thus alter'd with't

there is a sickness
which puts some of us in distemper but
I cannot name the disease and it is caught
of you that yet are well

how caught of me
make me not sighted like the basilisk
I have look'd on thousands who have sped the better
as you are certainly a gentleman thereto
clerk-like experienc'd which no less adorns
our gentry than our parents' noble names
in whose success we are gentle I beseech you
if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
thereof to be inform'd imprison it not
in ignorant concealment

I may not answer

a sickness caught of me and yet I well
I must be answer'd Dost thou hear Camillo
I conjure thee by all the parts of man
which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
is not this suit of mine that thou declare
what incidency thou dost guess of harm
is creeping toward me how far off how near
which way to be prevented if to be
if not how best to bear it
sir I will tell you
since I am charg'd in honour and by him
that I think honourable Therefore mark my counsel
which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it or both yourself and me
cry lost and so good night

on good Camillo

I am appointed him to murder you

by whom Camillo

by the king

for what

he thinks nay with all confidence he swears
as he had seen't or been an instrument
forbiddenly

O then my best blood turn
to an infected jelly and my name
be yok'd with his that did betray the Best
turn then my freshest reputation to
a savour that may strike the dullest nostril
where I arrive and my approach be shunn'd
nay hated too worse than the great'st infection
that e'er was heard or read

swear his thought over
by each particular star in heaven and
by all their influences you may as well
forbid the sea for to obey the moon
as or by oath remove or counsel shake
the fabric of his folly whose foundation
is pil'd upon his faith and will continue
the standing of his body
how should this grow

I know not but I am sure tis safer to
avoid what's grown than question how tis born
if therefore you dare trust my honesty
that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
shall bear along impawn'd away to-night
your followers I will whisper to the business
and will by twos and threes at several posterns
clear them o'the city For myself I'll put
my fortunes to your service which are here
by this discovery lost Be not uncertain
for by the honour of my parents I
have utter'd truth which if you seek to prove
I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth thereon
his execution sworn

I do believe thee
be pilot to me and thy places shall
still neighbour mine My ships are ready and
my people did expect my hence departure
two days ago This jealousy
is for a precious creature as she's rare
must it be great and as his person's mighty
must it be violent and as he does conceive
he is dishonour'd by a man which ever
profess'd to him why his revenges must
in that be made more bitter Fear o'ershades me
good expedition be my friend and comfort
the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing
of his ill-ta'en suspicion Come Camillo
I will respect thee as a father if
thou bear'st my life off hence let us avoid

it is in mine authority to command
the keys of all the posterns please your highness
to take the urgent hour Come sir away
take the boy to you he so troubles me Tis past enduring

come my gracious lord Shall I be your playfellow

no I'll none of you

why my sweet lord

you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still I love you better

and why so my lord

not for because
your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
become some women best so that there be not
too much hair there but in a semicircle
or a half-moon made with a pen


I learn'd it out of women's faces Pray now
what colour are your eyebrows

blue my lord

nay that's a mock I have seen a lady's nose
that has been blue but not her eyebrows

hark ye
the queen your mother rounds apace we shall
present our services to a fine new prince
one of these days and then you'd wanton with us
if we would have you

she is spread of late
into a goodly bulk good time encounter her

what wisdom stirs amongst you Come sir now
and tell's a tale

merry or sad shall't be

as merry as you will

a sad tale's best for winter
I have one of sprites and goblins

let's have that good sir
come on sit down come on and do your best
to fright me with your sprites you're powerful at it

there was a man

nay come sit down then on

dwelt by a churchyard I will tell it softly
yond crickets shall not hear it
come on then
and give't me in mine ear


was he met there his train Camillo with him

behind the tuft of pines I met them never
saw I men scour so on their way I ey'd them
even to their ships

how blest am I
in my just censure in my true opinion
alack for lesser knowledge How accurs'd
in being so blest There may be in the cup
a spider steep'd and one may drink depart
and yet partake no venom for his knowledge
is not infected but if one present
the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known
how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
Camillo was his help in this his pandar
there is a plot against my life my crown
all's true that is mistrusted that false villain
whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him
he has discover'd my design and I
remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick
for them to play at will How came the posterns
so easily open

by his great authority
which often hath no less prevail'd than so
on your command

I know't too well


give me the boy I am glad you did not nurse him
though he does bear some signs of me yet you
have too much blood in him
what is this sport

bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
away with him

and let her sport herself
with that she's big with for tis Polixenes
has made thee swell thus

but I'd say he had not
and I'll be sworn you would believe my saying
howe'er you lean to the nayward

you my lords
look on her mark her well be but about
to say she is a goodly lady and
the justice of your hearts will thereto add
''Tis pity she's not honest honourable
praise her but for this her without-door form
the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
that calumny doth use O I am out
that mercy does for calumny will sear
virtue itself these shrugs these hums and ha's
when you have said she's goodly come between
ere you can say she's honest But be't known
from him that has most cause to grieve it should be
she's an adulteress

should a villain say so
the most replenish'd villain in the world
he were as much more villain you my lord
do but mistake

you have mistook my lady
Polixenes for Leontes O thou thing
which I'll not call a creature of thy place
lest barbarism making me the precedent
should a like language use to all degrees
betwixt the prince and beggar I have said
she's an adulteress I have said with whom
more she's a traitor and Camillo is
a federary with her and one that knows
what she should shame to know herself
but with her most vile principal that she's
a bed-swerver even as bad as those
that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy
to this their late escape

no by my life
privy to none of this How will this grieve you
when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
you thus have publish'd me Gentle my lord
you scarce can right me throughly then to say
you did mistake

no if I mistake
in those foundations which I build upon
a schoolboy's top Away with her to prison
he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
but that he speaks

there's some ill planet reigns
I must be patient till the heavens look
with an aspect more favourable Good my lords
I am not prone to weeping as our sex
commonly are the want of which vain dew
perchance shall dry your pities but I have
that honourable grief lodg'd here which burns
worse than tears drown Beseech you all my lords
with thoughts so qualified as your charities
shall best instruct you measure me and so
the king's will be perform'd

shall I be heard

who is't that goes with me Beseech your highness
my plight requires it Do not weep good fools
there is no cause when you shall know your mistress
has deserv'd prison then abound in tears
as I come out this action I now go on
is for my better grace Adieu my lord
I never wish'd to see you sorry now
I trust I shall My women come you have leave

go do our bidding hence


beseech your highness call the queen again

be certain what you do sir lest your justice
prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
yourself your queen your son

for her my lord
I dare my life lay down and will do't sir
i' the eyes of heaven and to you I mean
in this which you accuse her

if it prove
she's otherwise I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife I'll go in couples with her
than when I feel and see her no further trust her
for every inch of woman in the world
ay every dram of woman's flesh is false
if she be

hold your peaces

good my lord

it is for you we speak not for ourselves
you are abus'd and by some putter-on
that will be damn'd for't would I knew the villain
I would land-damn him Be she honour-flaw'd
the second and the third nine and some five
if this prove true they'll pay for't by mine honour
I'll geld them all fourteen they shall not see
to bring false generations they are co-heirs
and I had rather glib myself than they
should not produce fair issue

cease no more
you smell this business with a sense as cold
as is a dead man's nose but I do see't and feel't
as you feel doing thus and see withal
the instruments that feel

if it be so
we need no grave to bury honesty
there's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
of the whole dungy earth

what lack I credit
I had rather you did lack than I my lord
upon this ground and more it would content me
to have her honour true than your suspicion
be blam'd for't how you might

why what need we
commune with you of this but rather follow
our forceful instigation Our prerogative
calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
imparts this which if you or stupified
or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
relish a truth like us inform yourselves
we need no more of your advice the matter
the loss the gain the ordering on't is all
properly ours

and I wish my liege
you had only in your silent judgment tried it
without more overture
how could that be
either thou art most ignorant by age
or thou wert born a fool Camillo's flight
added to their familiarity
which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture
that lack'd sight only nought for approbation
but only seeing all other circumstances
made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding
yet for a greater confirmation
for in an act of this importance twere
most piteous to be wild I have dispatch'd in post
to sacred Delphos to Apollo's temple
Cleomenes and Dion whom you know
of stuff'd sufficiency Now from the oracle
they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
shall stop or spur me Have I done well

well done my lord

than what I know yet shall the oracle
give rest to the minds of others such as he
whose ignorant credulity will not
come up to the truth So have we thought it good
from our free person she should be confin'd
lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
be left her to perform Come follow us
we are to speak in public for this business
will raise us all

to laughter as I take it
if the good truth were known


the keeper of the prison call to him
let him have knowledge who I am

good lady
no court in Europe is too good for thee


now good sir

you know me do you not

for a worthy lady
and one whom much I honour

pray you then
conduct me to the queen

I may not madam to the contrary
I have express commandment

here's ado
to lock up honesty and honour from
the access of gentle visitors Is't lawful pray you
to see her women any of them Emilia
so please you madam
to put apart these your attendants I
shall bring Emilia forth

I pray now call her
withdraw yourselves


and madam
I must be present at your conference

well be't so prithee

here's such ado to make no stain a stain
as passes colouring


dear gentlewoman


as well as one so great and so forlorn
may hold together On her frights and griefs
which never tender lady hath borne greater
she is something before her time deliver'd

a boy

a daughter and a goodly babe
lusty and like to live the queen receives
much comfort in't says My poor prisoner
I am innocent as you

I dare be sworn
these dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king beshrew them
he must be told on't and he shall the office
becomes a woman best I'll take't upon me
if I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
and never to my red-look'd anger be
commend my best obedience to the queen
if she dares trust me with her little babe
I'll show it to the king and undertake to be
her advocate to the loud'st We do not know
how he may soften at the sight of the child
the silence often of pure innocence
persuades when speaking fails

most worthy madam
your honour and your goodness is so evident
that your free undertaking cannot miss
a thriving issue there is no lady living
so meet for this great errand Please your ladyship
to visit the next room I'll presently
acquaint the queen of your most noble offer
who but to-day hammer'd of this design
but durst not tempt a minister of honour
lest she should be denied

I'll use that tongue I have if wit flow from't
as boldness from my bosom let it not be doubted
I shall do good

now be you blest for it
I'll to the queen Please you come something nearer

madam if't please the queen to send the babe
I know not what I shall incur to pass it
having no warrant

you need not fear it sir
the child was prisoner to the womb and is
by law and process of great nature thence
freed and enfranchis'd not a party to
the anger of the king nor guilty of
if any be the trespass of the queen

I do believe it
do not you fear upon mine honour I
will stand betwixt you and danger


nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness
to bear the matter thus mere weakness If
the cause were not in being part o' the cause
she the adultress for the harlot king
is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank
and level of my brain plot-proof but she
I can hook to me say that she were gone
given to the fire a moiety of my rest
might come to me again Who's there

my lord

how does the boy

he took good rest to-night

to see his nobleness
conceiving the dishonour of his mother
he straight declin'd droop'd took it deeply
fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself
threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
and downright languish'd Leave me solely go
see how he fares

fie fie no thought of him
the very thought of my revenges that way
recoil upon me in himself too mighty
and in his parties his alliance let him be
until a time may serve for present vengeance
take it on her Camillo and Polixenes
laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
they should not laugh if I could reach them nor
shall she within my power

you must not enter

nay rather good my lords be second to me
fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
than the queen's life a gracious innocent soul
more free than he is jealous

that's enough

madam he hath not slept to-night commanded
none should come at him

not so hot good sir
I come to bring him sleep Tis such as you
that creep like shadows by him and do sigh
at each his needless heavings such as you
nourish the cause of his awaking I
do come with words as med'cinal as true
honest as either to purge him of that humour

what noise there ho

no noise my lord but needful conference
about some gossips for your highness

how
away with that audacious lady Antigonus
I charg'd thee that she should not come about me
I knew she would

I told her so my lord
on your displeasure's peril and on mine
she should not visit you

what canst not rule her

from all dishonesty he can in this
unless he take the course that you have done
he shall not rule me

la you now you hear
when she will take the rein I let her run
but she'll not stumble

good my liege I come
and I beseech you hear me who professes
myself your loyal servant your physician
your most obedient counsellor yet that dares
less appear so in comforting your evils
than such as most seem yours I say I come
from your good queen

good queen

good queen my lord good queen I say good queen
and would by combat make her good so were I
a man the worst about you
force her hence

let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
first hand me on mine own accord I'll off
but first I'll do my errand The good queen
for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
here tis commends it to your blessing


out
a mankind witch Hence with her out o' door
a most intelligencing bawd

not so
I am as ignorant in that as you
in so entitling me and no less honest
than you are mad which is enough I'll warrant
as this world goes to pass for honest

will you not push her out Give her the bastard


thou dotard thou art woman-tir'd unroosted
by thy dame Partlet here Take up the bastard
take't up I say give't to thy crone

for ever
unvenerable be thy hands if thou
tak'st up the princess by that forced baseness
which he has put upon't

he dreads his wife

so I would you did then twere past all doubt
you'd call your children yours

a nest of traitors


nor I nor any
but one that's here and that's himself for he
the sacred honour of himself his queen's
his hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander
whose sting is sharper than the sword's and will not
for as the case now stands it is a curse
he cannot be compell'd to't once remove
the root of his opinion which is rotten
as ever oak or stone was sound

a callat
of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
and now baits me This brat is none of mine
it is the issue of Polixenes
hence with it and together with the dam
commit them to the fire

it is yours
'So like you tis the worse Behold my lords
although the print be little the whole matter
and copy of the father eye nose lip
the trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley
the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles
the very mould and frame of hand nail finger
and thou good goddess Nature which hast made it
so like to him that got it if thou hast
the ordering of the mind too mongst all colours
no yellow in't lest she suspect as he does
her children not her husband's

a gross hag
and lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd
that wilt not stay her tongue

hang all the husbands
that cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself
hardly one subject
once more take her hence

a most unworthy and unnatural lord
can do no more

I'll ha' thee burn'd

I care not
it is a heretic that makes the fire
not she which burns in't I'll not call you tyrant
but this most cruel usage of your queen
not able to produce more accusation
than your own weak-hing'd fancy something savours
of tyranny and will ignoble make you
yea scandalous to the world

on your allegiance
out of the chamber with her Were I a tyrant
where were her life she durst not call me so

I pray you do not push me I'll be gone
look to your babe my lord tis yours Jove send her
a better guiding spirit What need these hands
you that are thus so tender o'er his follies
will never do him good not one of you
so so farewell we are gone


thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
my child away with't even thou that hast
a heart so tender o'er it take it hence
and see it instantly consum'd with fire
even thou and none but thou Take it up straight
within this hour bring me word tis done
and by good testimony or I'll seize thy life
with what thou else call'st thine If thou refuse
and wilt encounter with my wrath say so
the bastard brains with these my proper hands
for thou sett'st on thy wife

I did not sir
these lords my noble fellows if they please
can clear me in't

we can my royal liege
he is not guilty of her coming hither

you are liars all

beseech your highness give us better credit
we have always truly serv'd you and beseech you
so to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
as recompense of our dear services
past and to come that you do change this purpose
which being so horrible so bloody must
lead on to some foul issue We all kneel

shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
and call me father Better burn it now
than curse it then But be it let it live
it shall not neither

you sir come you hither
you that have been so tenderly officious
with Lady Margery your midwife there
to save this bastard's life for tis a bastard
so sure as thy beard's grey what will you adventure
to save this brat's life

any thing my lord
that my ability may undergo
and nobleness impose at least thus much
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
to save the innocent any thing possible

it shall be possible Swear by this sword

I will my lord

mark and perform it seest thou for the fail
of any point in't shall not only be
death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongu'd wife
whom for this time we pardon We enjoin thee
as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
this female bastard hence and that thou bear it
to some remote and desart place quite out
of our dominions and that there thou leave it
without more mercy to its own protection
and favour of the climate As by strange fortune
it came to us I do in justice charge thee
on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture
that thou commend it strangely to some place
where chance may nurse or end it Take it up

I swear to do this though a present death
some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
to be thy nurses Wolves and bears they say
casting their savageness aside have done
like offices of pity Sir be prosperous
in more than this deed doth require And blessing
against this cruelty fight on thy side
poor thing condemn'd to loss


no I'll not rear
another's issue


please your highness posts
from those you sent to the oracle are come
an hour since Cleomenes and Dion
being well arriv'd from Delphos are both landed
hasting to the court

hath been beyond account

twenty-three days
they have been absent tis good speed foretells
the great Apollo suddenly will have
the truth of this appear Prepare you lords
summon a session that we may arraign
our most disloyal lady for as she hath
been publicly accus'd so shall she have
a just and open trial While she lives
my heart will be a burden to me Leave me
and think upon my bidding

the climate's delicate the air most sweet
fertile the isle the temple much surpassing
the common praise it bears

I shall report
for most it caught me the celestial habits
of the grave wearers O the sacrifice
how ceremonious solemn and unearthly
it was i' the offering

but of all the burst
and the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle
kin to Jove's thunder so surpris'd my sense
that I was nothing

if the event o' the journey
prove as successful to the queen O be't so
as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy
the time is worth the use on't

great Apollo
turn all to the best These proclamations
so forcing faults upon Hermione
I little like

will clear or end the business when the oracle
thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up
shall the contents discover something rare
even then will rush to knowledge Go fresh horses
and gracious be the issue


this sessions to our great grief we pronounce
even pushes gainst our heart the party tried
the daughter of a king our wife and one
of us too much belov'd Let us be clear'd
of being tyrannous since we so openly
proceed in justice which shall have due course
even to the guilt or the purgation
produce the prisoner

it is his highness' pleasure that the queen
appear in person here in court Silence

read the indictment

Hermione queen to the worthy Leontes King of Sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in committing adultery with Polixenes King of Bohemia and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open thou Hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for their better safety to fly away by night

since what I am to say must be but that
which contradicts my accusation and
the testimony on my part no other
but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
to say Not guilty mine integrity
being counted falsehood shall as I express it
be so receiv'd But thus if powers divine
behold our human actions as they do
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
false accusation blush and tyranny
tremble at patience You my lord best know
who least will seem to do so my past life
hath been as continent as chaste as true
as I am now unhappy which is more
than history can pattern though devis'd
a fellow of the royal bed which owe
a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter
the mother to a hopeful prince here standing
to prate and talk for life and honour fore
who please to come and hear For life I prize it
as I weigh grief which I would spare for honour
'Tis a derivative from me to mine
and only that I stand for I appeal
to your own conscience sir before Polixenes
came to your court how I was in your grace
how merited to be so since he came
with what encounter so uncurrent I
have strain'd to appear thus if one jot beyond
the bound of honour or in act or will
that way inclining harden'd be the hearts
of all that hear me and my near'st of kin
cry fie upon my grave

I ne'er heard yet
less impudence to gainsay what they did
than to perform it first

that's true enough
though tis a saying sir not due to me

you will not own it

more than mistress of
which comes to me in name of fault I must not
at all acknowledge For Polixenes
with whom I am accus'd I do confess
I lov'd him as in honour he requir'd
with such a kind of love as might become
a lady like me with a love even such
so and no other as yourself commanded
which not to have done I think had been in me
both disobedience and ingratitude
to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
that it was yours Now for conspiracy
I know not how it tastes though it be dish'd
for me to try how all I know of it
is that Camillo was an honest man
and why he left your court the gods themselves
wotting no more than I are ignorant

you knew of his departure as you know
what you have underta'en to do in's absence

sir
you speak a language that I understand not
my life stands in the level of your dreams
which I'll lay down

your actions are my dreams
you had a bastard by Polixenes
and I but dream'd it As you were past all shame
those of your fact are so so past all truth
thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
no father owning it which is indeed
more criminal in thee than it so thou
shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
look for no less than death

sir spare your threats
the bug which you would fright me with I seek
to me can life be no commodity
the crown and comfort of my life your favour
I do give lost for I do feel it gone
but know not how it went My second joy
and first-fruits of my body from his presence
I am barr'd like one infectious My third comfort
starr'd most unluckily is from my breast
the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth
hal'd out to murder myself on every post
proclaim'd a strumpet with immodest hatred
the child-bed privilege denied which longs
here to this place i'the open air before
I have got strength of limit Now my liege
tell me what blessings I have here alive
that I should fear to die Therefore proceed
but yet hear this mistake me not no life
I prize it not a straw but for mine honour
which I would free if I shall be condemn'd
upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
but what your jealousies awake I tell you
'Tis rigour and not law Your honours all
I do refer me to the oracle
Apollo be my judge

this your request
is altogether just therefore bring forth
and in Apollo's name his oracle


the Emperor of Russia was my father
his daughter's trial that he did but see
the flatness of my misery yet with eyes
of pity not revenge


you here shall swear upon this sword of justice
that you Cleomenes and Dion have
been both at Delphos and from thence have brought
this seal'd-up oracle by the hand deliver'd
of great Apollo's priest and that since then
you have not dar'd to break the holy seal
nor read the secrets in't

all this we swear

all this we swear

break up the seals and read


now blessed be the great Apollo

praised

hast thou read truth

ay my lord even so
as it is here set down

there is no truth at all i' the oracle
the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood


my lord the king the king

what is the business

O sir I shall be hated to report it
of the queen's speed is gone

how gone

is dead

Apollo's angry and the heavens themselves
do strike at my injustice

how now there

this news is mortal to the queen look down
and see what death is doing

take her hence
her heart is but o'ercharg'd she will recover
I have too much believ'd mine own suspicion
beseech you tenderly apply to her
some remedies for life
Apollo pardon
my great profaneness gainst thine oracle
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes
new woo my queen recall the good Camillo
whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy
for being transported by my jealousies
to bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
my friend Polixenes which had been done
but that the good mind of Camillo tardied
my swift command though I with death and with
reward did threaten and encourage him
not doing it and being done he most humane
and fill'd with honour to my kingly guest
unclasp'd my practice quit his fortunes here
which you knew great and to the certain hazard
of all incertainties himself commended
no richer than his honour how he glisters
thorough my rust and how his piety


woe the while
O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
break too

what fit is this good lady

what studied torments tyrant hast for me
what wheels racks fires What flaying or what boiling
in leads or oils what old or newer torture
must I receive whose every word deserves
to taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny
together working with thy jealousies
fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
for girls of nine O think what they have done
and then run mad indeed stark mad for all
thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it
that thou betray'dst Polixenes twas nothing
and damnable ingrateful nor was't much
thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour
to have him kill a king poor trespasses
more monstrous standing by whereof I reckon
the casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
to be or none or little though a devil
would have shed water out of fire ere done't
nor is't directly laid to thee the death
of the young prince whose honourable thoughts
thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
that could conceive a gross and foolish sire
blemish'd his gracious dam this is not no
laid to thy answer but the last O lords
when I have said cry woe the queen the queen
the sweetest dearest creature's dead and vengeance for't
not dropp'd down yet

the higher powers forbid

prevail not go and see if you can bring
tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
heat outwardly or breath within I'll serve you
as I would do the gods But O thou tyrant
do not repent these things for they are heavier
than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
to nothing but despair A thousand knees
ten thousand years together naked fasting
upon a barren mountain and still winter
in storm perpetual could not move the gods
to look that way thou wert

go on go on
thou canst not speak too much I have deserv'd
all tongues to talk their bitterest

say no more
howe'er the business goes you have made fault
i' the boldness of your speech
I am sorry for't
all faults I make when I shall come to know them
I do repent Alas I have show'd too much
the rashness of a woman he is touch'd
to the noble heart What's gone and what's past help
should be past grief do not receive affliction
at my petition I beseech you rather
let me be punish'd that have minded you
of what you should forget Now good my liege
sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
the love I bore your queen lo fool again
I'll speak of her no more nor of your children
I'll not remember you of my own lord
who is lost too take your patience to you
and I'll say nothing

thou didst speak but well
when most the truth which I receive much better
than to be pitied of thee Prithee bring me
one grave shall be for both upon them shall
the causes of their death appear unto
our shame perpetual Once a day I'll visit
the chapel where they lie and tears shed there
shall be my recreation so long as nature
will bear up with this exercise so long
I daily vow to use it Come and lead me
unto these sorrows


thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon
the desarts of Bohemia

ay my lord and fear
we have landed in ill time the skies look grimly
and threaten present blusters In my conscience
the heavens with that we have in hand are angry
and frown upon's

look to thy bark I'll not be long before
I call upon thee

make your best haste and go not
too far i' the land tis like to be loud weather
besides this place is famous for the creatures
of prey that keep upon't

go thou away
I'll follow instantly

I am glad at heart
to be so rid of the business


come poor babe
I have heard but not believ'd the spirits o' the dead
may walk again if such thing be thy mother
appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream
sometimes her head on one side some another
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow
so fill'd and so becoming in pure white robes
like very sanctity she did approach
my cabin where I lay thrice bow'd before me
and gasping to begin some speech her eyes
became two spouts the fury spent anon
did this break from her Good Antigonus
since fate against thy better disposition
hath made thy person for the thrower-out
of my poor babe according to thine oath
places remote enough are in Bohemia
there weep and leave it crying and for the babe
is counted lost for ever Perdita
I prithee call't for this ungentle business
put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see
thy wife Paulina more and so with shrieks
she melted into air Affrighted much
I did in time collect myself and thought
yet for this once yea superstitiously
I will be squar'd by this I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd death and that
Apollo would this being indeed the issue
of King Polixenes it should here be laid
either for life or death upon the earth
of its right father Blossom speed thee well

there lie and there thy character there these

which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
and still rest thine The storm begins poor wretch
that for thy mother's fault art thus expos'd
to loss and what may follow Weep I cannot
but my heart bleeds and most accurs'd am I
to be by oath enjoin'd to this Farewell
the day frowns more and more thou art like to have
a lullaby too rough I never saw
the heavens so dim by day A savage clamour
I am gone for ever

I would there were no age between sixteen and three-and-twenty or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry stealing fighting Hark you now Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather They have scared away two of my best sheep which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master if anywhere I have them tis by the sea-side browsing of ivy Good luck an't be thy will what have we here

mercy on's a barne a very pretty barne A boy or a child I wonder A pretty one a very pretty one sure some scape though I am not bookish yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape This has been some stair-work some trunk-work some behind-door-work they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here I'll take it up for pity yet I'll tarry till my son come he hollaed but even now Whoa ho hoa


hilloa loa

what art so near If thou'lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten come hither What ailest thou man

I have seen two such sights by sea and by land but I am not to say it is a see for it is now the sky betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin's point

why boy how is it

I would you did but see how it chafes how it rages how it takes up the shore but that's not to the point O the most piteous cry of the poor souls sometimes to see em and not to see em now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon swallowed with yest and froth as you'd thrust a cork into a hogshead And then for the land-service to see how the bear tore out his shoulderbone how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus a nobleman But to make an end of the ship to see how the sea flap-dragoned it but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than the sea or weather

name of mercy when was this boy


would I had been by to have helped the old man

I would you had been by the ship's side to have helped her there your charity would have lacked footing

heavy matters heavy matters but look thee here boy Now bless thyself thou mettest with things dying I with things new born Here's a sight for thee look thee a bearing-cloth for a squire's child Look thee here take up take up boy open't So let's see it was told me I should be rich by the fairies this is some changeling Open't What's within boy

you're a made old man if the sins of your youth are forgiven you you're well to live Gold all gold

this is fairy gold boy and twill prove so up with't keep it close home home the next way We are lucky boy and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy Let my sheep go Come good boy the next way home

go you the next way with your findings I'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten they are never curst but when they are hungry If there be any of him left I'll bury it

that's a good deed If thou mayst discern by that which is left of him what he is fetch me to the sight of him

marry will I and you shall help to put him i' the ground

'Tis a lucky day boy and we'll do good deeds on't

of good and bad that make and unfold error
now take upon me in the name of Time
to use my wings Impute it not a crime
to me or my swift passage that I slide
o'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
of that wide gap since it is in my power
to o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
to plant and o'erwhelm custom Let me pass
the same I am ere ancient'st order was
or what is now receiv'd I witness to
the times that brought them in so shall I do
to the freshest things now reigning and make stale
the glistering of this present as my tale
now seems to it Your patience this allowing
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
as you had slept between Leontes leaving
the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
that he shuts up himself imagine me
gentle spectators that I now may be
I mention'd a son o' the king's which Florizel
I now name to you and with speed so pace
to speak of Perdita now grown in grace
equal with wondering what of her ensues
I list not prophesy but let Time's news
be known when tis brought forth A shepherd's daughter
and what to her adheres which follows after
is th' argument of Time Of this allow
if ever you have spent time worse ere now
if never yet that Time himself doth say
he wishes earnestly you never may

I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate tis a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this

it is fifteen years since I saw my country though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I o'erween to think so which is another spur to my departure

as thou lovest me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee Thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues

sir it is three days since I saw the prince What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared
I have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate

I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage

that's likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither Prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia

I willingly obey your command

my best Camillo We must disguise ourselves

when daffodils begin to peer
with heigh the doxy over the dale
why then comes in the sweet o' the year
for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale


the white sheet bleaching on the hedge
with heigh the sweet birds O how they sing
doth set my pugging tooth on edge


the lark that tirra-lirra chants
with heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay
are summer songs for me and my aunts
while we lie tumbling in the hay


I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore three-pile but now I am out of service

but shall I go mourn for that my dear
the pale moon shines by night
and when I wander here and there
I then do most go right
if tinkers may have leave to live
and bear the sow-skin bowget
then my account I well may give
and in the stocks avouch it



let me see Every leven wether tods every tod yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred shorn what comes the wool to

if the springe hold the cock's mine

I cannot do't without compters Let me see what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast Three pound of sugar five pound of currants rice what will this sister of mine do with rice But my father hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it on She hath made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers three-man song-men all and very good ones but they are most of them means and bases but one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to hornpipes I must have saffron to colour the warden pies mace dates none that's out of my note nutmegs seven a race or two of ginger but that I may beg four pound of prunes and as many of raisins o' the sun

O that ever I was born


i' the name of me

O help me help me pluck but off these rags and then death death

alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off

O sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received which are mighty ones and millions


I am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel ta'en from me and these detestable things put upon me

what by a horseman or a footman

a footman sweet sir a footman

indeed he should be a footman by the garments he hath left with thee if this be a horseman's coat it hath seen very hot service Lend me thy hand I'll help thee come lend me thy hand


O good sir tenderly O

alas poor soul

O good sir softly good sir I fear sir my shoulder-blade is out

how now canst stand

softly dear sir
good sir softly You ha' done me a charitable office

dost lack any money I have a little money for thee

no good sweet sir no I beseech you sir I have a kinsman not past three-quarters of a mile hence unto whom I was going I shall there have money or anything I want offer me no money I pray you that kills my heart

what manner of fellow was he that robbed you

a fellow sir that I have known to go about with trol-my-dames I knew him once a servant of the prince I cannot tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court

his vices you would say there's no virtue whipped out of the court they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide

vices I would say sir I know this man well he hath been since an ape-bearer then a process-server a bailiff then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinker's wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue some call him Autolycus

out upon him Prig for my life prig he haunts wakes fairs and bear-baitings

very true sir he sir he that's the rogue that put me into this apparel

not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia if you had but looked big and spit at him he'd have run
I must confess to you sir I am no fighter I am false of heart that way and that he knew I warrant him

how do you now

sweet sir much better than I was I can stand and walk I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman's

shall I bring thee on the way

no good-faced sir no sweet sir

then fare thee well I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing

prosper you sweet sir

your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too If I make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue

jog on jog on the footpath way
and merrily hent the stile-a
a merry heart goes all the day

these your unusual weeds to each part of you
do give a life no shepherdess but Flora
peering in April's front This your sheep-shearing
is as a meeting of the petty gods
and you the queen on't

sir my gracious lord
to chide at your extremes it not becomes me
O pardon that I name them Your high self
the gracious mark o' the land you have obscur'd
with a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid
most goddess-like prank'd up But that our feasts
in every mess have folly and the feeders
digest it with a custom I should blush
to see you so attired swoon I think
to show myself a glass

I bless the time
thy father's ground

now Jove afford you cause
to me the difference forges dread your greatness
hath not been us'd to fear Even now I tremble
to think your father by some accident
should pass this way as you did O the Fates
how would he look to see his work so noble
vilely bound up What would he say Or how
should I in these my borrow'd flaunts behold
the sternness of his presence

apprehend
nothing but jollity The gods themselves
humbling their deities to love have taken
the shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter
became a bull and bellow'd the green Neptune
a ram and bleated and the fire-rob'd god
golden Apollo a poor humble swain
were never for a piece of beauty rarer
nor in a way so chaste since my desires
run not before mine honour nor my lusts
burn hotter than my faith

O but sir
your resolution cannot hold when tis
oppos'd as it must be by the power of the king
one of these two must be necessities
which then will speak that you must change this purpose
or I my life

thou dearest Perdita
with these forc'd thoughts I prithee darken not
the mirth o' the feast or I'll be thine my fair
or not my father's for I cannot be
mine own nor anything to any if
I be not thine to this I am most constant
though destiny say no Be merry gentle
that you behold the while Your guests are coming
lift up your countenance as it were the day
of celebration of that nuptial which
we two have sworn shall come

O lady Fortune
stand you auspicious

see your guests approach
address yourself to entertain them sprightly
and let's be red with mirth


fie daughter when my old wife liv'd upon
this day she was both pantler butler cook
both dame and servant welcom'd all serv'd all
would sing her song and dance her turn now here
at upper end o' the table now i' the middle
on his shoulder and his her face o' fire
she would to each one sip You are retir'd
as if you were a feasted one and not
the hostess of the meeting pray you bid
these unknown friends to's welcome for it is
a way to make us better friends more known
come quench your blushes and present yourself
that which you are mistress o' the feast come on
and bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing
as your good flock shall prosper

sir welcome
it is my father's will I should take on me
the hostess-ship o' the day

you're welcome sir
give me those flowers there Dorcas Reverend sirs
for you there's rosemary and rue these keep
seeming and savour all the winter long
Grace and remembrance be to you both

shepherdess
a fair one are you well you fit our ages
with flowers of winter

sir the year growing ancient
not yet on summer's death nor on the birth
of trembling winter the fairest flowers o' the season
are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors
which some call nature's bastards of that kind
our rustic garden's barren and I care not
to get slips of them

wherefore gentle maiden
do you neglect them

for I have heard it said
there is an art which in their piedness shares
with great creating nature
say there be
yet nature is made better by no mean
but nature makes that mean so over that art
which you say adds to nature is an art
that nature makes You see sweet maid we marry
a gentler scion to the wildest stock
and make conceive a bark of baser kind
by bud of nobler race this is an art
which does mend nature change it rather but
the art itself is nature

so it is

then make your garden rich in gillyvors
and do not call them bastards

I'll not put
the dibble in earth to set one slip of them
no more than were I painted I would wish
desire to breed by me Here's flowers for you
hot lavender mints savory marjoram
the marigold that goes to bed wi' the sun
and with him rises weeping these are flowers
of middle summer and I think they are given
to men of middle age You're very welcome

I should leave grazing were I of your flock
and only live by gazing

out alas
you'd be so lean that blasts of January
would blow you through and through Now my fair'st friend
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
become your time of day and yours and yours
that wear upon your virgin branches yet
your maidenheads growing O Proserpina
for the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall
from Dis's waggon daffodils
the winds of March with beauty violets dim
but sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
or Cytherea's breath pale prime-roses
that die unmarried ere they can behold
bright Ph bus in his strength a malady
most incident to maids bold oxlips and
the crown imperial lilies of all kinds
the flower-de-luce being one O these I lack
to make you garlands of and my sweet friend
to strew him o'er and o'er

what like a corse

no like a bank for love to lie and play on
not like a corse or if not to be buried
but quick and in mine arms Come take your flowers
methinks I play as I have seen them do
in Whitsun pastorals sure this robe of mine
does change my disposition
what you do
still betters what is done When you speak sweet
I'd have you do it ever when you sing
I'd have you buy and sell so so give alms
pray so and for the ordering your affairs
to sing them too when you do dance I wish you
a wave o' the sea that you might ever do
nothing but that move still still so
and own no other function each your doing
so singular in each particular
crowns what you are doing in the present deed
that all your acts are queens

O Doricles
your praises are too large but that your youth
and the true blood which fairly peeps through it
do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd
with wisdom I might fear my Doricles
you woo'd me the false way
I think you have
as little skill to fear as I have purpose
to put you to't But come our dance I pray
your hand my Perdita so turtles pair
that never mean to part

I'll swear for em

this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
ran on the green-sord nothing she does or seems
but smacks of something greater than herself
too noble for this place

he tells her something
that makes her blood look out Good sooth she is
the queen of curds and cream

come on strike up

to mend her kissing with

now in good time

not a word a word we stand upon our manners
come strike up


pray good shepherd what fair swain is this
which dances with your daughter

they call him Doricles and boasts himself
to have a worthy feeding but I have it
upon his own report and I believe it
he looks like sooth He says he loves my daughter
I think so too for never gaz'd the moon
upon the water as he'll stand and read
as twere my daughter's eyes and to be plain
I think there is not half a kiss to choose

she dances featly

so she does any thing though I report it
that should be silent If young Doricles
do light upon her she shall bring him that
which he not dreams of


O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe no the bagpipe could not move you He sings several tunes faster than you'll tell money he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's ears grew to his tunes

he could never come better he shall come in I love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably

he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he has the prettiest love-songs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with such delicate burthens of dildos and fadings jump her and thump her and where some stretchmouthed rascal would as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the maid to answer Whoop do me no harm good man puts him off slights him with Whoop do me no harm good man

this is a brave fellow

believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow Has he any unbraided wares


prithee bring him in and let him approach singing

forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in's tunes


you have of these pedlars that have more in them than you'd think sister

ay good brother or go about to think

lawn as white as driven snow
Cyprus black as e'er was crow
gloves as sweet as damask roses
masks for faces and for noses
bugle-bracelet necklace-amber
perfume for a lady's chamber
golden quoifs and stomachers
for my lads to give their dears
pins and poking-sticks of steel
come buy of me come come buy come buy
buy lads or else your lasses cry
come buy

if I were not in love with Mopsa thou shouldst take no money of me but being enthralled as I am it will also be the bondage of certain ribands and gloves

I was promised them against the feast but they come not too late now

he hath promised you more than that or there be liars

he hath paid you all he promised you may be he has paid you more which will shame you to give him again

is there no manners left among maids will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces Is there not milking-time when you are going to bed or kiln-hole to whistle off these secrets but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests Tis well they are whispering clamour your tongues and not a word more

I have done Come you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves

have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money

and indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it behoves men to be wary
fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here

I hope so sir for I have about me many parcels of charge

what hast here ballads

pray now buy some I love a ballad in print a-life for then we are sure they are true

here's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burden and how she longed to eat adders' heads and toads carbonadoed

is it true think you

very true and but a month old

bless me from marrying a usurer

here's the midwife's name to't one Mistress Taleporter and five or six honest wives' that were present Why should I carry lies abroad

pray you now buy it
come on lay it by and let's first see moe ballads we'll buy the other things anon

here's another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her The ballad is very pitiful and as true

is it true too think you

five justices' hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold

lay it by too another

this is a merry ballad but a very pretty one

let's have some merry ones

why this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of Two maids wooing a man there's scarce a maid westward but she sings it tis in request I can tell you

we can both sing it if thou'lt bear a part thou shalt hear tis in three parts

we had the tune on't a month ago
I can bear my part you must know tis my occupation have at it with you


get you hence for I must go
where it fits not you to know

whither

O whither

whither

it becomes thy oath full woll
thou to me thy secrets tell

me too let me go thither

or thou go'st to the grange or mill


neither

what neither

neither

thou hast sworn my love to be

thou hast sworn it more to me
then whither go'st say whither


we'll have this song out anon by ourselves my father and the gentlemen are in sad talk and we'll not trouble them come bring away thy pack after me Wenches I'll buy for you both Pedlar let's have the first choice Follow me girls


and you shall pay well for em

will you buy any tape
my dainty duck my dear-a
any silk any thread
any toys for your head
of the new'st and fin'st fin'st wear-a
come to the pedlar
money's a meddler
that doth utter all men's ware-a


master there is three carters three shepherds three neat-herds three swine-herds that have made themselves all men of hair they call themselves Saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are not in't but they themselves are o' the mind if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling it will please plentifully

away we'll none on't here has been too much homely foolery already I know sir we weary you

you weary those that refresh us pray let's see these four threes of herdsmen

one three of them by their own report sir hath danced before the king and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier

leave your prating since these good men are pleased let them come in but quickly now


O father you'll know more of that hereafter


is it not too far gone Tis time to part them
he's simple and tells much

how now fair shepherd
your heart is full of something that does take
your mind from feasting Sooth when I was young
and handed love as you do I was wont
to load my she with knacks I would have ransack'd
the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
to her acceptance you have let him go
and nothing marted with him If your lass
interpretation should abuse and call this
your lack of love or bounty you were straited
for a reply at least if you make a care
of happy holding her
old sir I know
she prizes not such trifles as these are
the gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
up in my heart which I have given already
but not deliver'd O hear me breathe my life
before this ancient sir who it should seem
hath sometime lov'd I take thy hand this hand
as soft as dove's down and as white as it
or Ethiopian's tooth or the fann'd snow
that's bolted by the northern blasts twice o'er

what follows this
how prettily the young swain seems to wash
the hand was fair before I have put you out
but to your protestation let me hear
what you profess

do and be witness to't


and he and more
than he and men the earth the heavens and all
that were I crown'd the most imperial monarch
thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth
that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
more than was ever man's I would not prize them
without her love for her employ them all
commend them and condemn them to her service
or to their own perdition

fairly offer'd

this shows a sound affection

but my daughter
say you the like to him

I cannot speak
by the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
the purity of his

take hands a bargain
and friends unknown you shall bear witness to't
I give my daughter to him and will make
her portion equal his

O that must be
i' the virtue of your daughter one being dead
I shall have more than you can dream of yet
enough then for your wonder But come on
contract us fore these witnesses

come your hand
and daughter yours

soft swain awhile beseech you
have you a father
I have but what of him

knows he of this

he neither does nor shall

methinks a father
is at the nuptial of his son a guest
that best becomes the table Pray you once more
is not your father grown incapable
of reasonable affairs is he not stupid
with age and altering rheums can he speak hear
know man from man dispute his own estate
lies he not bed-rid and again does nothing
but what he did being childish

no good sir
he has his health and ampler strength indeed
than most have of his age
by my white beard
you offer him if this be so a wrong
something unfilial Reason my son
should choose himself a wife but as good reason
the father all whose joy is nothing else
but fair posterity should hold some counsel
in such a business

I yield all this
but for some other reasons my grave sir
which tis not fit you know I not acquaint
my father of this business

let him know't

he shall not

prithee let him


let him my son he shall not need to grieve
at knowing of thy choice

come come he must not
mark our contract

mark your divorce young sir

whom son I dare not call thou art too base
to be acknowledg'd thou a sceptre's heir
that thus affect'st a sheep-hook Thou old traitor
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
but shorten thy life one week And thou fresh piece
of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
the royal fool thou cop'st with

O my heart

more homely than thy state For thee fond boy
if I may ever know thou dost but sigh
that thou no more shalt see this knack as never
I mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession
not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
far than Deucalion off mark thou my words
follow us to the court Thou churl for this time
though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
from the dead blow of it And you enchantment
worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
that makes himself but for our honour therein
unworthy thee if ever henceforth thou
these rural latches to his entrance open
or hoop his body more with thy embraces
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
as thou art tender to't


even here undone
I was about to speak and tell him plainly
the self-same sun that shines upon his court
hides not his visage from our cottage but
looks on alike Will't please you sir be gone
I told you what would come of this beseech you
of your own state take care this dream of mine
being now awake I'll queen it no inch further
but milk my ewes and weep

why how now father
speak ere thou diest

I cannot speak nor think
nor dare to know that which I know O sir
you have undone a man of fourscore three
that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
to die upon the bed my father died
to lie close by his honest bones but now
some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
that knew'st this was the prince and wouldst adventure
to mingle faith with him Undone undone
if I might die within this hour I have liv'd
to die when I desire


why look you so upon me
I am but sorry not afeard delay'd
but nothing alter'd What I was I am
more straining on for plucking back not following
my leash unwillingly

gracious my lord
you know your father's temper at this time
he will allow no speech which I do guess
you do not purpose to him and as hardly
will he endure your sight as yet I fear
then till the fury of his highness settle
come not before him
I not purpose it
I think Camillo

even he my lord

how often have I told you twould be thus
how often said my dignity would last
but till twere known

it cannot fail but by
the violation of my faith and then
let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
and mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks
from my succession wipe me father I
am heir to my affection

be advis'd

I am and by my fancy if my reason
if not my senses better pleas'd with madness
do bid it welcome

this is desperate sir

so call it but it does fulfil my vow
I needs must think it honesty Camillo
not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may
be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or
the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
in unknown fathoms will I break my oath
to this my fair belov'd Therefore I pray you
as you have ever been my father's honour'd friend
when he shall miss me as in faith I mean not
to see him any more cast your good counsels
upon his passion let myself and fortune
tug for the time to come This you may know
and so deliver I am put to sea
with her whom here I cannot hold on shore
a vessel rides fast by but not prepar'd
for this design What course I mean to hold
shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
concern me the reporting

O my lord
I would your spirit were easier for advice
or stronger for your need

hark Perdita


I'll hear you by and by

he's irremovable
resolv'd for flight Now were I happy if
his going I could frame to serve my turn
save him from danger do him love and honour
purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
I so much thirst to see

now good Camillo
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony

sir I think
you have heard of my poor services i' the love
that I have borne your father

very nobly
have you deserv'd it is my father's music
to speak your deeds not little of his care
to have them recompens'd as thought on

well my lord
if you may please to think I love the king
and through him what's nearest to him which is
your gracious self embrace but my direction
may suffer alteration on mine honour
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
as shall become your highness where you may
enjoy your mistress from the whom I see
there's no disjunction to be made but by
as heavens forfend your ruin marry her
and with my best endeavours in your absence
your discontenting father strive to qualify
and bring him up to liking

how Camillo
may this almost a miracle be done
that I may call thee something more than man
and after that trust to thee

have you thought on
a place whereto you'll go

not any yet
to what we wildly do so we profess
ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
of every wind that blows

then list to me
this follows if you will not change your purpose
but undergo this flight make for Sicilia
and there present yourself and your fair princess
for so I see she must be fore Leontes
she shall be habited as it becomes
the partner of your bed Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness
as twere i' the father's person kisses the hands
of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one
he chides to hell and bids the other grow
faster than thought or time

what colour for my visitation shall I
hold up before him

sent by the king your father
to greet him and to give him comforts Sir
the manner of your bearing towards him with
what you as from your father shall deliver
things known betwixt us three I'll write you down
the which shall point you forth at every sitting
what you must say that he shall not perceive
but that you have your father's bosom there
and speak his very heart

I am bound to you
there is some sap in this

a course more promising
than a wild dedication of yourselves
to unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain
but as you shake off one to take another
nothing so certain as your anchors who
do their best office if they can but stay you
where you'll be loath to be Besides you know
prosperity's the very bond of love
whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
affliction alters

one of these is true
I think affliction may subdue the cheek
but not take in the mind

yea say you so
there shall not at your father's house these seven years
be born another such

my good Camillo
she is as forward of her breeding as
she is i' the rear o' her birth
I cannot say tis pity
she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
to most that teach

your pardon sir for this
I'll blush you thanks

my prettiest Perdita
but O the thorns we stand upon Camillo
preserver of my father now of me
the med'cine of our house how shall we do
we are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son
nor shall appear in Sicilia

my lord
fear none of this I think you know my fortunes
do all lie there it shall be so my care
to have you royally appointed as if
the scene you play were mine For instance sir

ha ha what a fool Honesty is and Trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman I have sold all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a riband glass pomander brooch table-book ballad knife tape glove shoe-tie bracelet horn-ring to keep my pack from fasting they throng who should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture and what I saw to my good use I remembered My clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse I would have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing no feeling but my sir's song and admiring the nothing of it so that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's son and scared my choughs from the chaff I had not left a purse alive in the whole army


nay but my letters by this means being there
so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt

and those that you'll procure from King Leontes

shall satisfy your father

happy be you
all that you speak shows fair

whom have we here
we'll make an instrument of this omit
nothing may give us aid

if they have overheard me now why hanging
how now good fellow Why shakest thou so Fear not man here's no harm intended to thee

I am a poor fellow sir

why be so still here's nobody will steal that from thee yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly thou must think there's a necessity in't and change garments with this gentleman though the pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee there's some boot

I am a poor fellow sir

I know ye well enough

nay prithee dispatch the gentleman is half flayed already

are you in earnest sir

I smell the trick on't

dispatch I prithee

indeed I have had earnest but I cannot with conscience take it
unbuckle unbuckle

fortunate mistress let my prophecy
come home to ye you must retire yourself
into some covert take your sweetheart's hat
and pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face
dismantle you and as you can disliken
the truth of your own seeming that you may
for I do fear eyes over you to shipboard
get undescried

I see the play so lies
that I must bear a part

no remedy
have you done there

should I now meet my father
he would not call me son
nay you shall have no hat

come lady come Farewell my friend

adieu sir

O Perdita what have we twain forgot
pray you a word


what I do next shall be to tell the king
of this escape and whither they are bound
wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
to force him after in whose company
I shall review Sicilia for whose sight
I have a woman's longing

fortune speed us
thus we set on Camillo to the sea-side
the swifter speed the better


I understand the business I hear it To have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cut-purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive What an exchange had this been without boot what a boot is here with this exchange Sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do anything extempore The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels If I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal I would not do't I hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am I constant to my profession Aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain Every lane's end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work


see see what a man you are now There is no other way but to tell the king she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood

nay but hear me

nay but hear me

go to then

she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him Show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her this being done let the law go whistle I warrant you

I will tell the king all every word yea and his son's pranks too who I may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the king's brother-in-law

indeed brother-in-law was the furthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know not how much an ounce
very wisely puppies

well let us to the king there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard

I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master

pray heartily he be at palace

though I am not naturally honest I am so sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement [Takes off his false beard ] How now rustics whither are you bound

to the palace an it like your worship

your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and anything that is fitting to be known discover

we are but plain fellows sir

a lie you are rough and hairy Let me have no lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie

your worship had like to have given us one if you had not taken yourself with the manner
are you a courtier an't like you sir

whether it like me or no I am a courtier Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings hath not my gait in it the measure of the court receives not thy nose court-odour from me reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt Think'st thou for that I insinuate or toaze from thee thy business I am therefore no courtier I am courtier cap-a-pe and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon I command thee to open thy affair

my business sir is to the king

what advocate hast thou to him

I know not an't like you

advocate's the court-word for a pheasant say you have none

none sir I have no pheasant cock nor hen

how bless'd are we that are not simple men
yet nature might have made me as these are
therefore I'll not disdain

this cannot be but a great courtier
his garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely

he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical a great man I'll warrant I know by the picking on's teeth

the fardel there what's i' the fardel
wherefore that box

sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king and which he shall know within this hour if I may come to the speech of him

age thou hast lost thy labour

why sir

the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou be'st capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief

so tis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherd's daughter

if that shepherd be not now in hand-fast let him fly the curses he shall have the torture he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster


not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary An old sheep-whistling rogue a ram-tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace Some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say I draw our throne into a sheep cote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy

has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear an't like you sir

he has a son who shall be flayed alive then nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasp's nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua-vit or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall he be set against a brick-wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death But what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offences being so capital Tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king being something gently considered I'll bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is a man shall do it

he seems to be of great authority close with him give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand and no more ado Remember stoned and flayed alive

an't please you sir to undertake the business for us here is that gold I have I'll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you

after I have done what I promised

ay sir

well give me the moiety Are you a party in this business

in some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful one I hope I shall not be flayed out of it


comfort good comfort we must to the king and show our strange sights he must know tis none of your daughter nor my sister we are gone else Sir I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed and remain as he says your pawn till it be brought you

I will trust you Walk before toward the sea-side go on the right hand I will but look upon the hedge and follow you

we are blessed in this man as I may say even blessed

let's before as he bids us He was provided to do us good


if I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth I am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement I will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to't To him will I present them there may be matter in it

sir you have done enough and have perform'd
a saint-like sorrow no fault could you make
which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down
more penitence than done trespass At the last
do as the heavens have done forget your evil
with them forgive yourself

her and her virtues I cannot forget
my blemishes in them and so still think of
the wrong I did myself which was so much
that heirless it hath made my kingdom and
destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
bred his hopes out of

true too true my lord
if one by one you wedded all the world
or from the all that are took something good
to make a perfect woman she you kill'd
would be unparallel'd

I think so Kill'd
she I kill'd I did so but thou strik'st me
sorely to say I did it is as bitter
upon thy tongue as in my thought Now good now
say so but seldom

you might have spoken a thousand things that would
have done the time more benefit and grac'd
your kindness better

you are one of those
would have him wed again

if you would not so
you pity not the state nor the remembrance
of his most sovereign name consider little
what dangers by his highness' fail of issue
may drop upon his kingdom and devour
incertain lookers-on What were more holy
than to rejoice the former queen is well
what holier than for royalty's repair
for present comfort and for future good
to bless the bed of majesty again
with a sweet fellow to't

respecting her that's gone Besides the gods
will have fulfill'd their secret purposes
for has not the divine Apollo said
is't not the tenour of his oracle
that King Leontes shall not have an heir
till his lost child be found which that it shall
is all as monstrous to our human reason
as my Antigonus to break his grave
and come again to me who on my life
did perish with the infant Tis your counsel
my lord should to the heavens be contrary
oppose against their wills

care not for issue
the crown will find an heir great Alexander
left his to the worthiest so his successor
was like to be the best

good Paulina
I know in honour O that ever I
had squar'd me to thy counsel then even now
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes
have taken treasure from her lips

and left them
more rich for what they yielded

thou speak'st truth
no more such wives therefore no wife one worse
and better us'd would make her sainted spirit
again possess her corpse and on this stage
where we're offenders now appear soul-vex'd
and begin Why to me

had she such power
she had just cause

she had and would incense me

I should so
were I the ghost that walk'd I'd bid you mark
her eye and tell me for what dull part in't
you chose her then I'd shriek that even your ears
should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd
should be Remember mine

stars stars
and all eyes else dead coals Fear thou no wife
I'll have no wife Paulina

will you swear
never to marry but by my free leave

never Paulina so be bless'd my spirit

then good my lords bear witness to his oath


unless another
as like Hermione as is her picture
affront his eye

good madam

I have done
yet if my lord will marry if you will sir
no remedy but you will give me the office
to choose you a queen she shall not be so young
as was your former but she shall be such
as walk'd your first queen's ghost it should take joy
to see her in your arms

my true Paulina
we shall not marry till thou bidd'st us

that
never till then


one that gives out himself Prince Florizel
son of Polixenes with his princess she
the fairest I have yet beheld desires access
to your high presence

what with him he comes not
like to his father's greatness his approach
so out of circumstance and sudden tells us
'Tis not a visitation fram'd but forc'd
by need and accident What train

but few
and those but mean

his princess say you with him

that e'er the sun shone bright on

O Hermione
as every present time doth boast itself
above a better gone so must thy grave
give way to what's seen now Sir you yourself
have said and writ so but your writing now
is colder than that theme She had not been
nor was not to be equall'd thus your verse
flow'd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebb'd
to say you have seen a better

pardon madam
the one I have almost forgot your pardon
the other when she has obtain'd your eye
will have your tongue too This is a creature
would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
of all professors else make proselytes
of who she but bid follow
how not women

women will love her that she is a woman
more worth than any man men that she is
the rarest of all women

go Cleomenes
yourself assisted with your honour'd friends
bring them to our embracement Still tis strange

he thus should steal upon us

had our prince
jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd
well with this lord there was not full a month
between their births

prithee no more cease thou know'st
he dies to me again when talk'd of sure
will bring me to consider that which may
unfurnish me of reason They are come


your mother was most true to wedlock prince
for she did print your royal father off
conceiving you Were I but twenty-one
your father's image is so hit in you
his very air that I should call you brother
as I did him and speak of something wildly
by us perform'd before Most dearly welcome
and you fair princess goddess O alas
I lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth
might thus have stood begetting wonder as
you gracious couple do and then I lost
all mine own folly the society
amity too of your brave father whom
though bearing misery I desire my life


by his command
have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
give you all greetings that a king at friend
can send his brother and but infirmity
which waits upon worn times hath something seiz'd
his wish'd ability he had himself
the land and waters twixt your throne and his
measur'd to look upon you whom he loves
he bade me say so more than all the sceptres
and those that bear them living

O my brother
good gentleman the wrongs I have done thee stir
afresh within me and these thy offices
so rarely kind are as interpreters
of my behind-hand slackness Welcome hither
as is the spring to the earth And hath he too
expos'd this paragon to the fearful usage
to greet a man not worth her pains much less
the adventure of her person

good my lord
she came from Libya

where the war-like Smalus
that noble honour'd lord is fear'd and lov'd

most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
his tears proclaim'd his parting with her thence
a prosperous south-wind friendly we have cross'd
to execute the charge my father gave me
for visiting your highness my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd
who for Bohemia bend to signify
not only my success in Libya sir
but my arrival and my wife's in safety
here where we are
the blessed gods
purge all infection from our air whilst you
do climate here You have a holy father
a graceful gentleman against whose person
so sacred as it is I have done sin
for which the heavens taking angry note
have left me issueless and your father's bless'd
as he from heaven merits it with you
worthy his goodness What might I have been
might I a son and daughter now have look'd on
such goodly things as you


most noble sir
that which I shall report will bear no credit
were not the proof so nigh Please you great sir
Bohemia greets you from himself by me
desires you to attach his son who has
his dignity and duty both cast off
a shepherd's daughter

where's Bohemia speak

here in your city I now came from him
I speak amazedly and it becomes
my marvel and my message To your court
whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems
of this fair couple meets he on the way
the father of this seeming lady and
her brother having both their country quitted
with this young prince

Camillo has betray'd me
whose honour and whose honesty till now
endur'd all weathers

lay't so to his charge
he's with the king your father
who Camillo

Camillo sir I spake with him who now
has these poor men in question Never saw I
wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth
forswear themselves as often as they speak
Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
with divers deaths in death

O my poor father
the heaven sets spies upon us will not have
our contract celebrated

you are married

we are not sir nor are we like to be
the stars I see will kiss the valleys first
the odds for high and low's alike

is this the daughter of a king

she is
when once she is my wife

that once I see by your good father's speed
will come on very slowly I am sorry
most sorry you have broken from his liking
where you were tied in duty and as sorry
your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
that you might well enjoy her

dear look up
though Fortune visible an enemy
should chase us with my father power no jot
hath she to change our loves Beseech you sir
remember since you ow'd no more to time
than I do now with thought of such affections
step forth mine advocate at your request

would he do so I'd beg your precious mistress
which he counts but a trifle

sir my liege
your eye hath too much youth in't not a month
'Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
than what you look on now

I thought of her
even in these looks I made

but your petition
is yet unanswer'd I will to your father
your honour not o'erthrown by your desires
I am friend to them and you upon which errand
I now go toward him Therefore follow me
and mark what way I make come good my lord

beseech you sir were you present at this relation

I was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child

I would most gladly know the issue of it

I make a broken delivery of the business but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be

here comes a gentleman that haply knows more The news Rogero

nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the king's daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it

here comes the lady Paulina's steward he can deliver you more How goes it now sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir

most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear you'll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs The mantle of Queen Hermione her jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king's daughter Did you see the meeting of the two kings

no

then have you lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of There might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears There was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries O thy mother thy mother then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son-in-law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns I never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it
what pray you became of Antigonus that carried hence the child

like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open He was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherd's son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows

what became of his bark and his followers

wracked the same instant of their master's death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found But O the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing

the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted

one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queen's death with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an alas I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood Who was most marble there changed colour some swounded all sorrowed if all the world could have seen't the woe had been universal

are they returned to the court

no the princess hearing of her mother's statue which is in the keeping of Paulina a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile Nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup

I thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing

who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge Let's along

now had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much sea-sick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered But tis all one to me for had I been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits Here come those I have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune


come boy I am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born

you are well met sir You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born see you these clothes say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentleman born Give me the lie do and try whether I am not now gentleman born

I know you are now sir a gentleman born

ay and have been so any time these four hours

and so have I boy

so you have but I was a gentleman born before my father for the king's son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed

we may live son to shed many more

ay or else twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are
I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master

prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen

thou wilt amend thy life

ay an it like your good worship

give me thy hand I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia

you may say it but not swear it

not swear it now I am a gentleman Let boors and franklins say it I'll swear it

how if it be false son

if it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend and I'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but I'll swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands

I will prove so sir to my power
ay by any means prove a tall fellow if I do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not Hark the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the queen's picture Come follow us we'll be thy good masters


O grave and good Paulina the great comfort
that I have had of thee

what sovereign sir
I did not well I meant well All my services
you have paid home but that you have vouchsaf'd
with your crown'd brother and these your contracted
heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
it is a surplus of your grace which never
my life may last to answer

O Paulina
we honour you with trouble but we came
to see the statue of our queen your gallery
have we pass'd through not without much content
in many singularities but we saw not
the statue of her mother

as she liv'd peerless
so her dead likeness I do well believe
excels whatever yet you look'd upon
or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it
lonely apart But here it is prepare
to see the life as lively mock'd as ever
still sleep mock'd death behold and say tis well

I like your silence it the more shows off
your wonder but yet speak first you my liege
comes it not something near

her natural posture
chide me dear stone that I may say indeed
thou art Hermione or rather thou art she
in thy not chiding for she was as tender
as infancy and grace But yet Paulina
so aged as this seems

O not by much

so much the more our carver's excellence
which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
as she liv'd now

as now she might have done
so much to my good comfort as it is
now piercing to my soul O thus she stood
even with such life of majesty warm life
as now it coldly stands when first I woo'd her
I am asham'd does not the stone rebuke me
for being more stone than it O royal piece
there's magic in thy majesty which has
my evils conjur'd to remembrance and
from thy admiring daughter took the spirits
standing like stone with thee
and give me leave
and do not say tis superstition that
I kneel and then implore her blessing Lady
dear queen that ended when I but began
give me that hand of yours to kiss

O patience
the statue is but newly fix'd the colour's
not dry

my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
which sixteen winters cannot blow away
so many summers dry scarce any joy
did ever so long live no sorrow
but kill'd itself much sooner

dear my brother
let him that was the cause of this have power
to take off so much grief from you as he

indeed my lord
if I had thought the sight of my poor image
would thus have wrought you for the stone is mine
I'd not have show'd it

do not draw the curtain

no longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy
may think anon it moves

let be let be
would I were dead but that methinks already
what was he that did make it See my lord
would you not deem it breath'd and that those veins
did verily bear blood

masterly done
the very life seems warm upon her lip
the fixure of her eye has motion in't
as we are mock'd with art

I'll draw the curtain
my lord's almost so far transported that
he'll think anon it lives

O sweet Paulina
make me to think so twenty years together
no settled senses of the world can match
the pleasure of that madness Let't alone

I am sorry sir I have thus far stirr'd you but
I could afflict you further

do Paulina
for this affliction has a taste as sweet
as any cordial comfort Still methinks
there is an air comes from her what fine chisel
for I will kiss her

good my lord forbear
the ruddiness upon her lip is wet
you'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
with oily painting Shall I draw the curtain

no not these twenty years

so long could I
stand by a looker-on

either forbear
quit presently the chapel or resolve you
for more amazement If you can behold it
I'll make the statue move indeed descend
and take you by the hand but then you'll think
which I protest against I am assisted
by wicked powers
what you can make her do
I am content to look on what to speak
I am content to hear for tis as easy
to make her speak as move

it is requir'd
you do awake your faith Then all stand still
or those that think it is unlawful business
I am about let them depart

proceed
no foot shall stir

music awake her strike

'Tis time descend be stone no more approach
strike all that look upon with marvel Come
I'll fill your grave up stir nay come away
bequeath to death your numbness for from him

start not her actions shall be holy as
you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her
until you see her die again for then
you kill her double Nay present your hand
when she was young you woo'd her now in age
is she become the suitor

O she's warm
if this be magic let it be an art
lawful as eating

she embraces him

she hangs about his neck
if she pertain to life let her speak too

ay and make't manifest where she has liv'd
or how stol'n from the dead
that she is living
were it but told you should be hooted at
like an old tale but it appears she lives
though yet she speak not Mark a little while
please you to interpose fair madam kneel
and pray your mother's blessing Turn good lady
our Perdita is found


you gods look down
and from your sacred vials pour your graces
upon my daughter's head Tell me mine own
where hast thou been preserv'd where liv'd how found
thy father's court for thou shalt hear that I
knowing by Paulina that the oracle
gave hope thou wast in being have preserv'd
myself to see the issue

there's time enough for that
your joys with like relation Go together
you precious winners all your exultation
partake to every one I an old turtle
will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
my mate that's never to be found again
lament till I am lost

O peace Paulina
thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
as I by thine a wife this is a match
and made between's by vows Thou hast found mine
but how is to be question'd for I saw her
as I thought dead and have in vain said many
a prayer upon her grave I'll not seek far
for him I partly know his mind to find thee
an honourable husband Come Camillo
and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
is richly noted and here justified
by us a pair of kings Let's from this place
that e'er I put between your holy looks
my ill suspicion This' your son-in-law
and son unto the king whom heavens directing
is troth-plight to your daughter Good Paulina
lead us from hence where we may leisurely
each one demand and answer to his part
perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
we were dissever'd hastily lead away

TROILUS AND CRESSIDA

in Troy there lies the scene From isles of Greece
the princes orgulous their high blood chaf'd
have to the port of Athens sent their ships
fraught with the ministers and instruments
of cruel war sixty and nine that wore
their crownets regal from the Athenian bay
put forth toward Phrygia and their vow is made
to ransack Troy within whose strong immures
with wanton Paris sleeps and that's the quarrel
to Tenedos they come
and the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
their war-like fraughtage now on Dardan plains
the fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
their brave pavilions Priam's six-gated city
Dardan and Tymbria Ilias Chetas Trojan
and Antenorides with massy staples
and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
sperr up the sons of Troy
now expectation tickling skittish spirits
on one and other side Trojan and Greek
sets all on hazard And hither am I come
a prologue arm'd but not in confidence
of author's pen or actor's voice but suited
in like conditions as our argument
to tell you fair beholders that our play
leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
beginning in the middle starting thence away
like or find fault do as your pleasures are
now good or bad tis but the chance of war

call here my varlet I'll unarm again
why should I war without the walls of Troy
that find such cruel battle here within
each Trojan that is master of his heart
let him to field Troilus alas has none

will this gear ne'er be mended

the Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
but I am weaker than a woman's tear
tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
less valiant than the virgin in the night
and skilless as unpractis'd infancy

well I have told you enough of this for my part I'll not meddle nor make no further He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding
have I not tarried

ay the grinding but you must tarry the bolting

have I not tarried

ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening

still have I tarried

ay to the leavening but here's yet in the word hereafter' the kneading the making of the cake the heating of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lips

patience herself what goddess e'er she be
doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do
at Priam's royal table do I sit
and when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts
so traitor when she comes' When is she thence

well she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look or any woman else
I was about to tell thee when my heart
as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
lest Hector or my father should perceive me
I have as when the sun doth light a storm
buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness

an her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's well go to there were no more comparison between the women but for my part she is my kins woman I would not as they term it praise her but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit but

O Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus
when I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd
reply not in how many fathoms deep
they lie indrench'd I tell thee I am mad
in Cressid's love thou answer'st she is fair
pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
handlest in thy discourse O that her hand
in whose comparison all whites are ink
the cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tell'st me
as true thou tell'st me when I say I love her
but saying thus instead of oil and balm
thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
the knife that made it

I speak no more than truth

thou dost not speak so much

faith I'll not meddle in't Let her be as she is if she be fair tis the better for her an she be not she has the mends in her own hands

good Pandarus how now Pandarus

I have had my labour for my travail ill-thought on of her and ill-thought on of you gone between and between but small thanks for my labour

what art thou angry Pandarus what with me


say I she is not fair

I do not care whether you do or no She's a fool to stay behind her father let her to the Greeks and so I'll tell her the next time I see her For my part I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter

Pandarus

not I

sweet Pandarus

pray you speak no more to me I will leave all as I found it and there an end


peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds
fools on both sides Helen must needs bo fair
when with your blood you daily paint her thus
I cannot fight upon this argument
it is too starv'd a subject for my sword
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar
and he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
as she is stubborn-chaste against all suit
tell me Apollo for thy Daphne's love
what Cressid is what Pandar and what we
her bed is India there she lies a pearl
between our Ilium and where she resides
let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood
ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar
our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark


how now Prince Troilus wherefore not afield

because not there this woman's answer sorts
for womanish it is to be from thence
what news neas from the field to-day

that Paris is returned home and hurt
by whom neas

Troilus by Menelaus

let Paris bleed tis but a scar to scorn
Paris is gor'd with Menelaus' horn


hark what good sport is out of town to-day

better at home if would I might' were may
but to the sport abroad are you bound thither

in all swift haste

come go we then together


who were those went by
queen Hecuba and Helen

and whither go they

up to the eastern tower
whose height commands as subject all the vale
to see the battle Hector whose patience
is as a virtue fix'd to-day was mov'd
he chid Andromache and struck his armourer
and like as there were husbandry in war
before the sun rose he was harness'd light
and to the field goes he where every flower
did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
in Hector's wrath

what was his cause of anger

the noise goes this there is among the Greeks
a lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hector

good and what of him

they say he is a very man per se
and stands alone

so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs

this man lady hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it He is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing but every thing so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight

but how should this man that makes me smile make Hector angry

they say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking

who comes here


madam your uncle Pandarus


as may be in the world lady

what's that what's that

good morrow uncle Pandarus

good morrow cousin Cressid What do you talk of Good morrow Alexander
how do you cousin When were you at Ilium

this morning uncle

what were you talking of when I came Was Hector armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium Helen was not up was she

Hector was gone but Helen was not up

e'en so Hector was stirring early

that were we talking of and of his anger
was he angry

so he says here

true he was so I know the cause too he'll lay about him to-day I can tell them that and there's Troilus will not come far behind him let them take heed of Troilus I can tell them that too

what is he angry too

who Troilus Troilus is the better man of the two

O Jupiter there's no comparison

what not between Troilus and Hector
do you know a man if you see him

ay if I ever saw him before and knew him

well I say Troilus is Troilus


no nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees

'Tis just to each of them he is himself

himself Alas poor Troilus I would he were

so he is

condition I had gone bare-foot to India

he is not Hector

himself no he's not himself Would a' were himself well the gods are above time must friend or end well Troilus well I would my heart were in her body No Hector is not a better man than Troilus

excuse me

he is elder


th' other's not come to't you shall tell me another tale when the other's come to't Hector shall not have his wit this year

he shall not need it if he have his own

nor his qualities

no matter

nor his beauty

'Twould not become him his own's better

you have no judgment niece Helen herself swore th' other day that Troilus for a brown favour for so tis I must confess not brown neither

no but brown

faith to say truth brown and not brown


she prais'd his complexion above Paris

why Paris hath colour enough

so he has

then Troilus should have too much if she praised him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion I had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose

I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris

then she's a merry Greek indeed

nay I am sure she does She came to him th' other day into the compassed window and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin

indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total

why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector


but to prove to you that Helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin

Juno have mercy how came it cloven

why you know tis dimpled I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia

O he smiles valiantly

does he not

O yes an twere a cloud in autumn

why go to then But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus

Troilus will stand to the proof if you'll prove it so

Troilus why he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg


I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin indeed she has a marvell's white hand I must needs confess

without the rack

and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin

alas poor chin many a wart is richer

but there was such laughing Queen Hecuba laughed that her eyes ran o'er

with millstones

and Cassandra laughed

but there was more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes did her eyes run o'er too

and Hector laughed


marry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin

an't had been a green hair I should have laughed too

they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer

what was his answer

quoth she Here's but one-and-fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white

this is her question

that's true make no question of that One-and-fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons Jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is Paris my husband The forked one quoth he pluck't out and give it him But there was such laughing and Helen so blushed and Paris so chafed and all the rest so laughed that it passed

so let it now for it has been a great while going by

well cousin I told you a thing yesterday think on't


I'll be sworn tis true he will weep you an twere a man born in April

and I'll spring up in his tears an twere a nettle against May


hark they are coming from the field Shall we stand up here and see them as they pass toward Ilium good niece do sweet niece Cressida

at your pleasure

here here here's an excellent place here we may see most bravely I'll tell you them all by their names as they pass by but mark Troilus above the rest

speak not so loud


that's neas is not that a brave man he's one of the flowers of Troy I can tell you but mark Troilus you shall see anon


who's that
that's Antenor he has a shrewd wit I can tell you and he's a man good enough he's one o' the soundest judgments in Troy whosoever and a proper man of person When comes Troilus I'll show you Troilus anon if he see me you shall see him nod at me

will he give you the nod

you shall see

if he do the rich shall have more


that's Hector that that look you that there's a fellow Go thy way Hector There's a brave man niece O brave Hector Look how he looks there's a countenance Is't not a brave man

O a brave man

is a' not It does a man's heart good Look you what hacks are on his helmet look you yonder do you see look you there there's no jesting there's laying on take't off who will as they say there be hacks

be those with swords

swords any thing he cares not an the devil come to him it's all one by God's lid it does one's heart good Yonder comes Paris yonder comes Paris


who's that


that's Helenus I marvel where Troilus is That's Helenus I think he went not forth to-day That's Helenus

can Helenus fight uncle

Helenus no yes he'll fight indifferent well I marvel where Troilus is Hark do you not hear the people cry Troilus Helenus is a priest

what sneaking fellow comes yonder


where yonder that's Deiphobus
tis Troilus there's a man niece Hem Brave
Troilus the prince of chivalry

peace for shame peace


here come more


asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran porridge after meat I could live and die i' the eyes of Troilus Ne'er look ne'er look the eagles are gone crows and daws crows and daws I had rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece

there is among the Greeks Achilles a better man than Troilus

Achilles a drayman a porter a very camel

well well

'Well well Why have you any discretion have you any eyes Do you know what a man is Is not birth beauty good shape discourse manhood learning gentleness virtue youth liberality and so forth the spice and salt that season a man

ay a minced man and then to be baked with no date in the pie for then the man's date's out

you are such a woman one knows not at what ward you lie

upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these wards I lie at a thousand watches
say one of your watches

nay I'll watch you for that and that's one of the chiefest of them too if I cannot ward what I would not have hit I can watch you for telling how I took the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it's past watching

you are such another


sir my lord would instantly speak with you

where

at your own house there he unarms him

good boy tell him I come

I doubt he be hurt Fare ye well good niece

adieu uncle


to bring uncle

ay a token from Troilus

by the same token you are a bawd

words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice
he offers in another's enterprise
but more in Troilus thousand-fold I see
than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be
yet hold I off Women are angels wooing
things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing
that she belov'd knows nought that knows not this
men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is
that she was never yet that ever knew
love got so sweet as when desire did sue
therefore this maxim out of love I teach
achievement is command ungain'd beseech
nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear


princes
what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks
the ample proposition that hope makes
in all designs begun on earth below
fails in the promis'd largeness checks and disasters
grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd
as knots by the conflux of meeting sap
infect the sound pine and divert his grain
tortive and errant from his course of growth
nor princes is it matter new to us
that we come short of our suppose so far
that after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand
sith every action that hath gone before
whereof we have record trial did draw
bias and thwart not answering the aim
and that unbodied figure of the thought
do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works
and call them shames which are indeed nought else
but the protractive trials of great Jove
to find persistive constancy in men
the fineness of which metal is not found
in Fortune's love for then the bold and coward
the wise and fool the artist and unread
the hard and soft seem all affin'd and kin
but in the wind and tempest of her frown
distinction with a broad and powerful fan
puffing at all winnows the light away
and what hath mass or matter by itself
lies rich in virtue and unmingled

with due observance of thy god-like seat
great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply
thy latest words In the reproof of chance
lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth
how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
with those of nobler bulk
but let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
the gentle Thetis and anon behold
the strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut
bounding between the two moist elements
like Perseus' horse where's then the saucy boat
whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
co-rivall'd greatness either to harbour fled
or made a toast for Neptune Even so
doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
the herd hath more annoyance by the breese
than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage
as rous'd with rage with rage doth sympathize
and with an accent tun'd in self-same key
retorts to chiding fortune

thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece
heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
in whom the tempers and the minds of all
should be shut up hear what Ulysses speaks
besides the applause and approbation
the which

most mighty for thy place and sway


and thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
I give to both your speeches which were such
as Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
should hold up high in brass and such again
as venerable Nestor hatch'd in silver
should with a bond of air strong as the axle-tree
on which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears
to his experienc'd tongue yet let it please hoth
thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak
speak Prince of Ithaca and be't of less expect
that matter needless of importless burden
divide thy lips than we are confident
when rank Thersites opes his mastick jaws
we shall hear music wit and oracle

Troy yet upon his basis had been down
and the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master
but for these instances
the specialty of rule hath been neglected
and look how many Grecian tents do stand
hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
when that the general is not like the hive
to whom the foragers shall all repair
what honey is expected Degree being vizarded
the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask
the heavens themselves the planets and this centre
observe degree priority and place
insisture course proportion season form
and therefore is the glorious planet Sol
in noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd
amidst the other whose med'cinable eye
corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
and posts like the commandment of a king
sans check to good and bad but when the planets
in evil mixture to disorder wander
what plagues and what portents what mutiny
what raging of the sea shaking of earth
commotion in the winds frights changes horrors
divert and crack rend and deracinate
the unity and married calm of states
quite from their fixure O when degree is shak'd
which is the ladder to all high designs
the enterprise is sick How could communities
degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
peaceful commerce from dividable shores
the primogenitive and due of birth
prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
take but degree away untune that string
and hark what discord follows each thing meets
in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
and make a sop of all this solid globe
strength should be lord of imbecility
and the rude son should strike his father dead
force should be right or rather right and wrong
between whose endless jar justice resides
should lose their names and so should justice too
then every thing includes itself in power
power into will will into appetite
and appetite a universal wolf
so doubly seconded with will and power
must make perforce a universal prey
and last eat up himself Great Agamemnon
this chaos when degree is suffocate
follows the choking
and this neglection of degree it is
it hath to climb The general's disdain'd
by him one step below he by the next
that next by him beneath so every step
exampled by the first pace that is sick
of his superior grows to an envious fever
of pale and bloodless emulation
and tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot
not her own sinews To end a tale of length
Troy in our weakness lives not in her strength

most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
the fever whereof all our power is sick

the nature of the sickness found Ulysses
what is the remedy

the great Achilles whom opinion crowns
the sinew and the forehand of our host
having his ear full of his airy fame
lies mocking our designs With him Patroclus
upon a lazy bed the livelong day
breaks scurril jests
and with ridiculous and awkward action
which slanderer he imitation calls
he pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon
thy topless deputation he puts on
and like a strutting player whose conceit
lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
to hear the wooden dialogue and sound
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage
such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
'Tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquar'd
which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff
the large Achilles on his press'd bed lolling
from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
cries Excellent tis Agamemnon just
as he being drest to some oration
that's done as near as the extremest ends
of parallels like as Vulcan and his wife
yet good Achilles still cries Excellent
'Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus
arming to answer in a night alarm
and then forsooth the faint defects of age
must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit
and with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget
shake in and out the rivet and at this sport
sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus
or give me ribs of steel I shall split all
in pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion
all our abilities gifts natures shapes
severals and generals of grace exact
achievements plots orders preventions
excitements to the field or speech for truce
success or loss what is or is not serves
as stuff for these two to make paradoxes
and in the imitation of these twain
whom as Ulysses says opinion crowns
with an imperial voice many are infect
Ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
in such a rein in full as proud a place
as broad Achilles keeps his tent like him
makes factious feasts rails on our state of war
bold as an oracle and sets Thersites
a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
to match us in comparison with dirt
to weaken and discredit our exposure
how rank soever rounded in with danger

they tax our policy and call it cowardice
count wisdom as no member of the war
forestall prescience and esteem no act
but that of hand the still and mental parts
that do contrive how many hands shall strike
when fitness calls them on and know by measure
why this hath not a finger's dignity
they call this bed-work mappery closet-war
so that the ram that batters down the wall
for the great swing and rudeness of his poise
they place before his hand that made the engine
or those that with the fineness of their souls
by reason guides his execution

let this be granted and Achilles' horse
makes many Thetis' sons


what trumpet look Menelaus

from Troy


what would you fore our tent


even this

may one that is a herald and a prince
do a fair message to his kingly ears

with surety stronger than Achilles' arm
'Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice
call Agamemnon head and general

fair leave and large security How may
a stranger to those most imperial looks
know them from eyes of other mortals

how

ay
I ask that I might waken reverence
and bid the cheek be ready with a blush
the youthful Ph bus
which is that god in office guiding men
which is the high and mighty Agamemnon

this Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy
are ceremonious courtiers

courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd
as bending angels that's their fame in peace
but when they would seem soldiers they have galls
good arms strong joints true swords and Jove's accord
nothing so full of heart But peace neas
peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips
the worthiness of praise distains his worth
if that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth
but what the repining enemy commends
that breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends

sir you of Troy call you yourself neas
ay Greek that is my name

what's your affair I pray you

sir pardon tis for Agamemnon's ears

he hears nought privately that comes from Troy

nor I from Troy come not to whisper him
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear
to set his sense on the attentive bent
and then to speak

speak frankly as the wind
it is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour
that thou shalt know Trojan he is awake
he tells thee so himself

trumpet blow aloud
and every Greek of mettle let him know
what Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud

we have great Agamemnon here in Troy
a prince called Hector Priam is his father
who in this dull and long-continu'd truce
is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet
and to this purpose speak kings princes lords
if there be one among the fair'st of Greece
that holds his honour higher than his ease
that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
that knows his valour and knows not his fear
that loves his mistress more than in confession
with truant vows to her own lips he loves
and dare avow her beauty and her worth
in other arms than hers to him this challenge
Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks
shall make it good or do his best to do it
he hath a lady wiser fairer truer
and will to-morrow with his trumpet call
mid-way between your tents and walls of Troy
to rouse a Grecian that is true in love
if any come Hector shall honour him
if none he'll say in Troy when he retires
the Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
the splinter of a lance Even so much

this shall be told our lovers Lord neas
if none of them have soul in such a kind
we left them all at home but we are soldiers
and may that soldier a mere recreant prove
that means not hath not or is not in love
if then one is or hath or means to be
that one meets Hector if none else I am he

tell him of Nestor one that was a man
when Hector's grandsire suck'd he is old now
but if there be not in our Grecian host
to answer for his love tell him from me
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
and in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn
and meeting him will tell him that my lady
was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
as may be in the world his youth in flood
I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood

now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth

amen

fair Lord neas let me touch your hand
to our pavilion shall I lead you first
Achilles shall have word of this intent
so shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent
yourself shall feast with us before you go
and find the welcome of a noble foe

Nestor

what says Ulysses

I have a young conception in my brain
be you my time to bring it to some shape

what is't

this tis
blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride
that hath to this maturity blown up
in rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd
or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
to overbulk us all

well and how

this challenge that the gallant Hector sends
relates in purpose only to Achilles

the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
whose grossness little characters sum up
and in the publication make no strain
but that Achilles were his brain as barren
as banks of Libya though Apollo knows
'Tis dry enough will with great speed of judgment
ay with celerity find Hector's purpose
pointing on him

and wake him to the answer think you

yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose
that can from Hector bring those honours off
if not Achilles Though't be a sportful combat
yet in the trial much opinion dwells
for here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
with their fin'st palate and trust to me Ulysses
in this wild action for the success
although particular shall give a scantling
of good or bad unto the general
and in such indexes although small pricks
to their subsequent volumes there is seen
the baby figure of the giant mass
of things to come at large It is suppos'd
he that meets Hector issues from our choice
and choice being mutual act of all our souls
makes merit her election and doth boil
as twere from forth us all a man distill'd
out of our virtues who miscarrying
what heart receives from bence the conquering part
to steel a strong opinion to themselves
which entertain'd limbs are his instruments
in no less working than are swords and bows
directive by the limbs

give pardon to my speech
let us like merchants show our foulest wares
and think perchance they'll sell if not
the lustre of the better yet to show
shall show the better Do not consent
that ever Hector and Achilles meet
for both our honour and our shame in this
are dogg'd with two strange followers

I see them not with my old eyes what are they

what glory our Achilles shares from Hector
were he not proud we all should share with him
but he already is too insolent
and we were better parch in Afric sun
than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
should he scape Hector fair if he were foil'd
why then we did our main opinion crush
in taint of our best man No make a lottery
and by device let blockish Ajax draw
give him allowance as the worthier man
for that will physic the great Myrmidon
who broils in loud applause and make him fall
his crest that prouder than blue Iris bends
if the dull brainless Ajax come safe off
we'll dress him up in voices if he fail
yet go we under our opinion still
that we have better men But hit or miss
our project's life this shape of sense assumes
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes

Ulysses
now I begin to relish thy advice
and I will give a taste of it forthwith
to Agamemnon go we to him straight
two curs shall tame each other pride alone
must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone



Agamemnon how if he had boils full all over generally

Thersites

and those boils did run Say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy core

dog

then would come some matter from him I see none now

thou bitch-wolf's son canst thou not hear
feel then


the plague of Greece upon thee thou mongrel beef-witted lord

speak then thou vinewedst leaven speak I will beat thee into handsomeness


toadstool learn me the proclamation

dost thou think I have no sense thou strikest me thus

the proclamation

thou art proclaimed a fool I think

do not porpentine do not my fingers itch

I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee I would make thee the loathsomest scab of Greece When thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another

I say the proclamation

thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpina's beauty ay that thou barkest at him

mistress Thersites


cobloaf

he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit

you whoreson cur


do do

thou stool for a witch

ay do do thou sodden-witted lord thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows an assinego may tutor thee thou scurvy-valiant ass thou art here but to thrash Trojans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave If thou use to beat me I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou

you dog

you scurvy lord

you cur

Mars his idiot do rudeness do camel do do


why how now Ajax wherefore do you this
how now Thersites what's the matter man

you see him there do you

ay what's the matter

nay look upon him

so I do what's the matter

nay but regard him well

'Well why so I do


I know that fool

ay but that fool knows not himself

therefore I beat thee

lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his evasions have ears thus long I have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones I will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow This lord Achilles Ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head I'll tell you what I say of him

what

I say this Ajax


nay good Ajax

has not so much wit

nay I must hold you
as will stop the eye of Helen's needle for whom he comes to fight

peace fool

I would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you there

O thou damned cur I shall

will you set your wit to a fool's

no I warrant you for a fool's will shame it

good words Thersites

what's the quarrel

I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation and he rails upon me

I serve thee not
well go to go to

I serve here voluntary

your last service was sufferance twas not voluntary no man is beaten voluntary Ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impress

even so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars Hector shall have a great catch if he knock out either of your brains a' were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel

what with me too Thersites

there's Ulysses and old Nestor whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars

what what

yes good sooth to Achilles to Ajax to

I shall cut out your tongue

'Tis no matter I shall speak as much as thou afterwards
no more words Thersites peace

I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me shall I

there's for you Patroclus

I will see you hanged like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools


a good riddance

marry this sir is proclaim'd through all our host
that Hector by the fifth hour of the sun
will with a trumpet twixt our tents and Troy
to morrow morning call some knight to arms
that hath a stomach and such a one that dare
maintain I know not what tis trash Farewell

farewell Who shall answer him
I know not it is put to lottery otherwise
he knew his man

O meaning you I will go learn more of it


after so many hours lives speeches spent
thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks
'Deliver Helen and all damage else
as honour loss of time travail expense
wounds friends and what else dear that is consum'd
in hot digestion of this cormorant war
shall be struck off Hector what say you to't

though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
as far as toucheth my particular
yet dread Priam
there is no lady of more softer bowels
more spongy to suck in the sense of fear
than Hector is The wound of peace is surety
surety secure but modest doubt is call'd
the beacon of the wise the tent that searches
to the bottom of the worst Let Helen go
since the first sword was drawn about this question
every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes
hath been as dear as Helen I mean of ours
if we have lost so many tenths of ours
to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
had it our name the value of one ten
what merit's in that reason which denies
the yielding of her up

fie fie my brother
weigh you the worth and honour of a king
so great as our dread father in a scale
of common ounces will you with counters sum
the past proportion of his infinite
and buckle in a waist most fathomless
as fears and reasons fie for godly shame

no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
you are so empty of them Should not our father
bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
because your speech hath none that tells him so

you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
you fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons
you know an enemy intends you harm
you know a sword employ'd is perilous
and reason flies the object of all harm
who marvels then when Helenus beholds
a Grecian and his sword if he do set
the very wings of reason to his heels
and fly like chidden Mercury from Jove
or like a star disorb'd Nay if we talk of reason
let's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour
should have hare-hearts would they but fat their thoughts
make livers pale and lustihood deject

brother she is not worth what she doth cost
the holding

what is aught but as tis valu'd

but value dwells not in particular will
it holds his estimate and dignity
as well wherein tis precious of itself
as in the prizer Tis mad idolatry
to make the service greater than the god
and the will dotes that is inclinable
to what infectiously itself affects
without some image of the affected merit

I take to-day a wife and my election
is led on in the conduct of my will
my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
of will and judgment How may I avoid
although my will distaste what it elected
the wife I chose there can be no evasion
to blench from this and to stand firm by honour
we turn not back the silks upon the merchant
when we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands
we do not throw in unrespective sink
because we now are full It was thought meet
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks
your breath of full consent bellied his sails
the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
and did him service he touch'd the ports desir'd
and for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive
he brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness
wrinkles Apollo's and makes stale the morning
why keep we her the Grecians keep our aunt
is she worth keeping why she is a pearl
whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships
and turn'd crown'd kings to merchants
as you must needs for you all cried Go go
if you'll confess he brought home noble prize
as you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands
and cry'd Inestimable why do you now
the issue of your proper wisdoms rate
and do a deed that Fortune never did
beggar the estimation which you priz'd
richer than sea and land O theft most base
that we have stol'n what we do fear to keep
but thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n
that in their country did them that disgrace
we fear to warrant in our native place

cry Trojans cry

what noise what shriek

'Tis our mad sister I do know her voice


it is Cassandra


cry Trojans cry lend me ten thousand eyes
and I will fill them with prophetic tears

peace sister peace

virgins and boys mid-age and wrinkled eld
soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
add to my clamours let us pay betimes
a moiety of that mass of moan to come
cry Trojans cry practise your eyes with tears
Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand
our firebrand brother Paris burns us all
cry Trojans cry a Helen and a woe
cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go

now youthful Troilus do not these high strains
of divination in our sister work
some touches of remorse or is your blood
so madly hot that no discourse of reason
nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
can qualify the same

why brother Hector
we may not think the justness of each act
such and no other than event doth form it
nor once deject the courage of our minds
because Cassandra's mad her brain-sick raptures
cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
which hath our several honours all engag'd
to make it gracious For my private part
I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons
and Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
such things as might offend the weakest spleen
to fight for and maintain
else might the world convince of levity
as well my undertakings as your counsels
but I attest the gods your full consent
gave wings to my propension and cut off
all fears attending on so dire a project
for what alas can these my single arms
what propugnation is in one man's valour
to stand the push and enmity of those
this quarrel would excite Yet I protest
were I alone to pass the difficulties
and had as ample power as I have will
Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
nor faint in the pursuit

Paris you speak
like one besotted on your sweet delights
you have the honey still but these the gall
so to be valiant is no praise at all

the pleasure such a beauty brings with it
but I would have the soil of her fair rape
wip'd off in honourable keeping her
what treason were it to the ransack'd queen
disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
now to deliver her possession up
on terms of base compulsion Can it be
that so degenerate a strain as this
should once set footing in your generous bosoms
there's not the meanest spirit on our party
without a heart to dare or sword to draw
when Helen is defended nor none so noble
whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
where Helen is the subject then I say
well may we fight for her whom we know well
the world's large spaces cannot parallel

Paris and Troilus you have both said well
and on the cause and question now in hand
unlike young men whom Aristotle thought
unfit to hear moral philosophy
the reasons you allege do more conduce
to the hot passion of distemper'd blood
than to make up a free determination
'Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
of any true decision Nature craves
all dues be render'd to their owners now
what nearer debt in all humanity
than wife is to the husband if this law
of nature be corrupted through affection
and that great minds of partial indulgence
to their benumbed wills resist the saine
there is a law in each well-order'd nation
to curb those raging appetites that are
most disobedient and refractory
if Helen then be wife to Sparta's king
as it is known she is these moral laws
to have her back return'd thus to persist
in doing wrong extenuates not wrong
but makes it much more heavy Hector's opinion
is this in way of truth yet ne'ertheless
my spritely brethren I propend to you
in resolution to keep Helen still
for tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
upon our joint and several dignities

why there you touch'd the life of our design
were it not glory that we more affected
than the performance of our heaving spleens
I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
spent more in her defence But worthy Hector
she is a theme of honour and renown
a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
whose present courage may beat down our foes
and fame in time to come canonize us
for I presume brave Hector would not lose
as smiles upon the forehead of this action
for the wide world's revenue

I am yours
you valiant offspring of great Priamus
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
the dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
I was advertis'd their great general slept
whilst emulation in the army crept
this I presume will wake him


how now Thersites what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus he beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he railed at me Sfoot I'll learn to conjure and raise devils but I'll see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then there's Achilles a rare enginer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan bone-ache for that methinks is the curse dependant on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say Amen What ho my Lord Achilles


who's there Thersites Good Thersites come in and rail

if I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself The common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corpse I'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars Amen Where's Achilles
what art thou devout wast thou in prayer

ay the heavens hear me


who's there

Thersites my lord

where where Art thou come Why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals Come what's Agamemnon

thy commander Achilles Then tell me Patroclus what's Achilles

thy lord Thersites Then tell me I pray thee what's thyself

thy knower Patroclus Then tell me Patroclus what art thou

thou mayst tell that knowest


I'll decline the whole question Agamemnon commands Achilles Achilles is my lord I am Patroclus' knower and Patroclus is a fool

you rascal

peace fool I have not done

he is a privileged man Proceed Thersites

Agamemnon is a fool Achilles is a fool Thersites is a fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a fool

derive this come

Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and Patroclus is a fool positive

why am I a fool

make that demand to the Creator It suffices me thou art Look you who comes here



here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery all the argument is a cuckold and a whore a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon Now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all

where is Achilles

within his tent but ill-dispos'd my lord

let it be known to him that we are here
he shent our messengers and we lay by
our appertainments visiting of him
let him be told so lest perchance he think
we dare not move the question of our place
or know not what we are

I shall say so to him


we saw him at the opening of his tent

yes lion-sick sick of proud heart you may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head tis pride but why why let him show us a cause A word my lord


what moves Ajax thus to bay at him

Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him

who Thersites

he

then will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument

no you see he is his argument that has his argument Achilles

all the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite

the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie Here comes Patroclus

no Achilles with him

the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure

Achilles bids me say he is much sorry
if any thing more than your sport and pleasure
did move your greatness and this noble state
to call upon him he hopes it is no other
but for your health and your digestion sake
an after-dinner's breath

hear you Patroclus
we are too well acquainted with these answers
but his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn
cannot outfly our apprehensions
much attribute he hath and much the reason
why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues
not virtuously on his own part beheld
yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
are like to rot untasted Go and tell him
we come to speak with him and you shall not sin
if you do say we think him over-proud
and under-honest in self-assumption greater
than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself
here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
disguise the holy strength of their command
and underwrite in an observing kind
his humorous predominance yea watch
his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
the passage and whole carriage of this action
rode on his tide Go tell him this and add
that if he overhold his price so much
we'll none of him but let him like an engine
not portable lie under this report
'Bring action hither this cannot go to war
a stirring dwarf we do allowance give
before a sleeping giant tell him so
I shall and bring his answer presently


in second voice we'll not be satisfied
we come to speak with him Ulysses enter you


what is he more than another

no more than what he thinks he is

is he so much Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am

no question

will you subscribe his thought and say he is

no noble Ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable


your mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the fairer He that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise

I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering of toads

yet he loves himself is't not strange


Achilles will not to the field to-morrow

what's his excuse

he doth rely on none
but carries on the stream of his dispose
without observance or respect of any
in will peculiar and in self-admission

why will he not upon our fair request
untent his person and share the air with us
things small as nothing for request's sake only
he makes important possess'd he is with greatness
and speaks not to himself but with a pride
that quarrels at self-breath imagin'd worth
holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
that twixt his mental and his active parts
kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
and batters down himself what should I say
he is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
cry No recovery

let Ajax go to him
dear lord go you and meet him in his tent
'Tis said he holds you well and will be led
at your request a little from himself

O Agamemnon let it not be so
we'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
when they go from Achilles shall the proud lord
and never suffers matter of the world
enter his thoughts save such as do revolve
and ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd
of that we hold an idol more than he
no this thrice-worthy and right valiant lord
must not so stale his palm nobly acquir'd
nor by my will assubjugate his merit
as amply titled as Achilles is
by going to Achilles
that were to enlard his fat-already pride
and add more coals to Cancer when he burns
with entertaining great Hyperion
this lord go to him Jupiter forbid
and say in thunder Achilles go to him

O this is well he rubs the vein of him

and how his silence drinks up this applause

I'll pash him o'er the face

O no you shall not go

an a' be proud with me I'll pheeze his pride
let me go to him

not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel

a paltry insolent fellow

how he describes himself

can he not be sociable

the raven chides blackness

I'll let his humours blood


an all men were o' my mind

wit would be out of fashion

a' should not bear it so a' should eat swords first shall pride carry it

an't would you'd carry half

a' would have ten shares

I will knead him I will make him supple

he's not yet through warm force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dry

my lord you feed too much on this dislike

our noble general do not do so


why tis this naming of him does him harm
here is a man but tis before his face
I will be silent

wherefore should you so
he is not emulous as Achilles is

know the whole world he is as valiant

a whoreson dog that shall palter thus with us Would he were a Trojan

what a vice were it in Ajax now

if he were proud

or covetous of praise

ay or surly borne
or strange or self-affected

thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure
praise him that got thee her that gave thee suck
fam'd be thy tutor and thy parts of nature
thrice-fam'd beyond all erudition
but he that disciplin'd thy arms to fight
let Mars divide eternity in twain
and give him half and for thy vigour
bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
to sinewy Ajax I will not praise thy wisdom
which like a bourn a pale a shore confines
thy spacious and dilated parts here's Nestor
instructed by the antiquary times
he must he is he cannot but be wise
but pardon father Nestor were your days
as green as Ajax and your brain so temper'd
you should not have the eminence of him
but be as Ajax
shall I call you father

ay my good son

be rul'd by him Lord Ajax

there is no tarrying here the hart Achilles
keeps thicket Please it our great general
to call together all his state of war
fresh kings are come to Troy to-morrow
we must with all our main of power stand fast
and here's a lord come knights from east to west
and cull their flower Ajax shall cope the best

go we to council Let Achilles sleep
light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep


friend you pray you a word do not you follow the young Lord Paris

ay good now love love nothing but love
in good troth it begins so


love love nothing but love still more
for oh love's bow
shoots buck and doe
the shaft confounds
not that it wounds
but tickles still the sore
these lovers cry O O they die
yet that which seems the wound to kill
doth turn O O to ha ha he
so dying love lives still
O O a while but ha ha ha
O O groans out for ha ha ha

heigh-ho

in love i' faith to the very tip of the nose
he eats nothing but doves love and that breeds hot blood and hot blood begets hot thoughts and hot thoughts beget hot deeds and hot deeds is love

is this the generation of love hot blood hot thoughts and hot deeds Why they are vipers is love a generation of vipers Sweet lord who's a-field to-day

Hector Deiphobus Helenus Antenor and all the gallantry of Troy I would fain have armed to-day but my Nell would not have it so How chance my brother Troilus went not

he hangs the lip at something you know all Lord Pandarus

not I honey-sweet queen I long to hear how they sped to-day You'll remember your brother's excuse

to a hair

farewell sweet queen

commend me to your niece

I will sweet queen


to greet the warriors Sweet Helen I must woo you
to help unarm our Hector his stubborn buckles
with these your white enchanting fingers touch'd
shall more obey than to the edge of steel
or force of Greekish sinews you shall do more
than all the island kings disarm great Hector

'Twill make us proud to be his servant Paris
yea what he shall receive of us in duty
gives us more palm in beauty than we have
yea overshines ourself

sweet above thought I love thee


how now where's thy master at my cousin Cressida's

no sir he stays for you to conduct him thither

O here he comes How now how now

sirrah walk off


have you seen my cousin

no Pandarus I stalk about her door
like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
staying for waftage O be thou my Charon
and give me swift transportance to those fields
where I may wallow in the lily-beds
propos'd for the deserver O gentle Pandarus
from Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
and fly with me to Cressid

walk here i' the orchard I'll bring her straight


the imaginary relish is so sweet
that it enchants my sense What will it be
when that the watery palate tastes indeed
love's thrice-repured nectar death I fear me
swounding destruction or some joy too fine
too subtle-potent tun'd too sharp in sweetness
for the capacity of my ruder powers
I fear it much and I do fear besides
that I shall lose distinction in my joys
as doth a battle when they charge on heaps
the enemy flying


she's making her ready she'll come straight you must be witty now She does so blush and fetches her wind so short as if she were frayed with a sprite I'll fetch her It is the prettiest villain she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta'en sparrow


even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
my heart beats thicker than a fev'rous pulse
and all my powers do their bestowing lose
the eye of majesty


come come what need you blush shame's a baby Here she is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me What are you gone again you must be watched ere you be made tame must you Come your ways come your ways an you draw backward we'll put you i' the fills Why do you not speak to her Come draw this curtain and let's see your picture Alas the day how loath you are to offend day-light an twere dark you'd close sooner So so rub on and kiss the mistress How now a kiss in fee-farm build there carpenter the air is sweet Nay you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you The falcon as the tercel for all the ducks i' the river go to go to

you have bereft me of all words lady

words pay no debts give her deeds but she'll bereave you of the deeds too if she call your activity in question What billing again Here's In witness whereof the parties interchangeably' Come in come in I'll go get a fire


will you walk in my lord

O Cressida how often have I wished me thus

wished my lord The gods grant O my lord

what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love

more dregs than water if my fears have eyes
fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly

blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to fear the worst oft cures the worse

O let my lady apprehend no fear in all Cupid's pageant there is presented no monster

nor nothing monstrous neither

nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed This is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit

they say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters

are there such such are not we Praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble Few words to fair faith Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus

will you walk in my lord


what blushing still have you not done talking yet


I thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you you'll give him me Be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for it

you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my firm faith

nay I'll give my word for her too Our kindred though they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won they are burrs I can tell you they'll stick where they are thrown

boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
prince Troilus I have lov'd you night and day
for many weary months

why was my Cressid then so hard to win

hard to seem won but I was won my lord
with the first glance that ever pardon me
if I confess much you will play the tyrant
I love you now but till now not so much
but I might master it in faith I lie
my thoughts were like unbridled children grown
why have I blabb'd who shall be true to us
when we are so unsecret to ourselves
but though I lov'd you well I woo'd you not
and yet good faith I wish'd myself a man
or that we women had men's privilege
of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue
for in this rapture I shall surely speak
the thing I shall repent See see your silence
cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
my very soul of counsel Stop my mouth

and shall albeit sweet music issues thence

pretty i' faith

my lord I do beseech you pardon me
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss
I am asham'd O heavens what have I done
for this time will I take my leave my lord
your leave sweet Cressid

leave an you take leave till to-morrow morning

pray you content you

what offends you lady

sir mine own company

you cannot shun yourself

let me go and try
I have a kind of self resides with you
but an unkind self that itself will leave
to be another's fool I would be gone
where is my wit I speak I know not what

well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
perchance my lord I show more craft than love
and fell so roundly to a large confession
to angle for your thoughts but you are wise
or else you love not for to be wise and love
exceeds man's might that dwells with gods above

O that I thought it could be in a woman
as if it can I will presume in you
to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love
to keep her constancy in plight and youth
outliving beauty's outward with a mind
that doth renew swifter than blood decays
or that persuasion could but thus convince me
that my integrity and truth to you
might be affronted with the match and weight
of such a winnow'd purity in love
how were I then uplifted but alas
I am as true as truth's simplicity
and simpler than the infancy of truth
in that I'll war with you

O virtuous fight
when right with right wars who shall be most right
true swains in love shall in the world to come
approve their truths by Troilus when their rimes
full of protest of oath and big compare
want similes truth tir'd with iteration
as true as steel as plantage to the moon
as sun to day as turtle to her mate
as iron to adamant as earth to the centre
yet after all comparisons of truth
as truth's authentic author to be cited
'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse
and sanctify the numbers

prophet may you be
if I be false or swerve a hair from truth
when time is old and hath forgot itself
and blind oblivion swallow'd cities up
and mighty states characterless are grated
to dusty nothing yet let memory
from false to false among false maids in love
upbraid my falsehood when they have said as false
as air as water wind or sandy earth
as fox to lamb as wolf to heifer's calf
pard to the hind or stepdame to her son
yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
'As false as Cressid

go to a bargain made seal it seal it I'll be the witness Here I hold your hand here my cousin's If ever you prove false one to another since I have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end after my name call them all Pandars let all constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids and all brokers-between Pandars say Amen

amen

amen

amen Whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters press it to death away
and Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here


now princes for the service I have done you
the advantage of the time prompts me aloud
to call for recompense Appear it to your mind
that through the sight I bear in things to come
I have abandon'd Troy left my possession
incurr'd a traitor's name expos'd myself
from certain and possess'd conveniences
to doubtful fortunes sequestering from me all
that time acquaintance custom and condition
made tame and most familiar to my nature
and here to do you service have become
as new into the world strange unacquainted
I do beseech you as in way of taste
to give me now a little benefit
out of those many register'd in promise
which you say live to come in my behalf


you have a Trojan prisoner call'd Antenor
yesterday took Troy holds him very dear
oft have you often have you thanks therefore
desir'd my Cressid in right great exchange
whom Troy hath still denied but this Antenor
I know is such a wrest in their affairs
that their negociations all must slack
wanting his manage and they will almost
give us a prince of blood a son of Priam
in change of him let him be sent great princes
and he shall buy my daughter and her presence
shall quite strike off all service I have done
in most accepted pain

let Diomedes bear him
and bring us Cressid hither Calchas shall have
what he requests of us Good Diomed
furnish you fairly for this interchange
be answer'd in his challenge Ajax is ready

this shall I undertake and tis a burden
which I am proud to bear

Achilles stands in the entrance of his tent
please it our general to pass strangely by him
as if he were forgot and princes all
lay negligent and loose regard upon him
I will come last Tis like he'll question me
why such unplausive eyes are bent on him
if so I have derision med'cinable
to use between your strangeness and his pride
which his own will shall have desire to drink
it may do good pride hath no other glass
to show itself but pride for supple knees
feed arrogance and are the poor man's fees

we'll execute your purpose and put on
so do each lord and either greet him not
or else disdainfully which shall shake him more
than if not look'd on I will lead the way

what comes the general to speak with me
you know my mind I'll fight no more gainst Troy

what says Achilles would he aught with us

would you my lord aught with the general

no

nothing my lord

the better


good day good day
how do you how do you


what does the cuckold scorn me

how now Patroclus

good morrow Ajax

ha

good morrow

ay and good next day too


what mean these fellows Know they not Achilles

they pass by strangely they were us'd to bend
to come as humbly as they us'd to creep
to holy altars

what am I poor of late
'Tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune
must fall out with men too what the declin'd is
he shall as soon read in the eyes of others
as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
show not their mealy wings but to the summer
and not a man for being simply man
hath any honour but honour for those honours
that are without him as places riches and favour
prizes of accident as oft as merit
which when they fall as being slippery standers
the love that lean'd on them as slippery too
do one pluck down another and together
die in the fall But tis not so with me
fortune and I are friends I do enjoy
at ample point all that I did possess
something not worth in me such rich beholding
as they have often given Here is Ulysses
I'll interrupt his reading
how now Ulysses

now great Thetis' son

what are you reading

a strange fellow here
writes me
that man how dearly ever parted
how much in having or without or in
cannot make boast to have that which he hath
nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
as when his virtues shining upon others
heat them and they retort that heat again
to the first giver

the beauty that is borne here in the face
the bearer knows not but commends itself
to others' eyes nor doth the eye itself
that most pure spirit of sense behold itself
not going from itself but eye to eye oppos'd
salutes each other with each other's form
for speculation turns not to itself
till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
where it may see itself This is not strange at all

I do not strain at the position
it is familiar but at the author s drift
who in his circumstance expressly proves
that no man is the lord of any thing
though in and of him there be much consisting
till he communicate his parts to others
nor doth he of himself know them for aught
till he behold them form'd in the applause
where they're extended who like an arch reverberates
fronting the sun receives and renders back
his figure and his heat I was much rapt in this
and apprehended here immediately
the unknown Ajax
heavens what a man is there a very horse
that has he knows not what Nature what things there are
most abject in regard and dear in use
what things again most dear in the esteem
and poor in worth Now shall we see to-morrow
an act that very chance doth throw upon him
Ajax renown'd O heavens what some men do
while some men leave to do
how some men creep in skittish Fortune's hall
whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
how one man eats into another's pride
while pride is fasting in his wantonness
to see these Grecian lords why even already
they clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder
as if his foot were on brave Hector's breast

I do believe it for they pass'd by me
as misers do by beggars neither gave to me
good word or look what are my deeds forgot

time hath my lord a wallet at his back
wherein he puts alms for oblivion
a great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes
those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd
as fast as they are made forgot as soon
as done perseverance dear my lord
keeps honour bright to have done is to hang
quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
in monumental mockery Take the instant way
for honour travels in a strait so narrow
where one but goes abreast keep then the path
for emulation hath a thousand sons
that one by one pursue if you give way
or hedge aside from the direct forthright
and leave you hindmost
or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank
lie there for pavement to the abject rear
o'errun and trampled on then what they do in present
though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours
for time is like a fashionable host
that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand
and with his arms outstretch'd as he would fly
grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles
and farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek
remuneration for the thing it was
for beauty wit
high birth vigour of bone desert in service
love friendship charity are subjects all
to envious and calumniating time
one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
that all with one consent praise new-born gawds
though they are made and moulded of things past
and give to dust that is a little gilt
the present eye praises the present object
then marvel not thou great and complete man
that all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax
since things in motion sooner catch the eye
than what not stirs The cry went once on thee
and still it might and yet it may again
if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
and case thy reputation in thy tent
whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves
and drave great Mars to faction

of this my privacy
I have strong reasons

but gainst your privacy
the reasons are more potent and heroical
'Tis known Achilles that you are in love
with one of Priam's daughters
ha known

is that a wonder
the providence that's in a watchful state
knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold
finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps
keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
there is a mystery with whom relation
durst never meddle in the soul of state
which hath an operation more divine
than breath or pen can give expressure to
all the commerce that you have had with Troy
as perfectly is ours as yours my lord
and better would it fit Achilles much
to throw down Hector than Polyxena
but it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home
when fame shall in our islands sound her trump
and all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
but our great Ajax bravely beat down him
farewell my lord I as your lover speak
the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break


to this effect Achilles have I mov'd you
a woman impudent and mannish grown
is not more loath'd than an effeminate man
in time of action I stand condemn'd for this
they think my little stomach to the war
and your great love to me restrains you thus
sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid
shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
and like a dew-drop from the lion's mane
be shook to air

shall Ajax fight with Hector

ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
I see my reputation is at stake
my fame is shrewdly gor'd

O then beware
those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
omission to do what is necessary
seals a commission to a blank of danger
and danger like an ague subtly taints
even then when we sit idly in the sun

go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
t' invite the Trojan lords after the combat
to see us here unarmed I have a woman's longing
an appetite that I am sick withal
to see great Hector in his weeds of peace
to talk with him and to behold his visage
even to my full of view A labour sav'd

a wonder

what

Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself

how so

he must fight singly to-morrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing

how can that be

why he stalks up and down like a peacock a stride and a stand ruminates like a hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say There were wit in this head an twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking The man's undone for ever for if Hector break not his neck i' the combat he'll break't himself in vainglory He knows not me I said Good morrow Ajax and he replies Thanks Agamemnon What think you of this man that takes me for the general He's grown a very land-fish languageless a monster A plague of opinion a man may wear it on both sides like a leather jerkin

thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites

who I why he'll answer nobody he professes not answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in his arms I will put on his presence let Patroclus make demands to me you shall see the pageant of Ajax

to him Patroclus tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmed to my tent and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured captain-general of the Grecian army Agamemnon et c tera Do this
Jove bless great Ajax

hum

I come from the worthy Achilles

ha

who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent

hum

and to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon

Agamemnon

ay my lord

ha
what say you to't

God be wi' you with all my heart

your answer sir

if to-morrow be a fair day by eleven o'clock it will go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me

your answer sir

fare you well with all my heart

why but he is not in this tune is he

no but he's out o' tune thus What music will be in him when Hector has knocked out his brains I know not but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on

come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight

let me bear another to his horse for that's the more capable creature
my mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd
and I myself see not the bottom of it


would the fountain of your mind were clear again that I might water an ass at it I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance

see ho who is that there

it is the Lord neas

is the prince there in person
had I so good occasion to lie long
as you Prince Paris nothing but heavenly business
should rob my bed-mate of my company

that's my mind too Good morrow Lord neas

a valiant Greek neas take his hand
witness the process of your speech wherein
did haunt you in the field

health to you valiant sir
during all question of the gentle truce
but when I meet you arm'd as black defiance
as heart can think or courage execute

the one and other Diomed embraces
our bloods are now in calm and so long health
but when contention and occasion meet
by Jove I'll play the hunter for thy life
with all my force pursuit and policy

and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
with his face backward In humane gentleness
welcome to Troy now by Anchises' life
welcome indeed By Venus' hand I swear
no man alive can love in such a sort
the thing he means to kill more excellently
we sympathize Jove let neas live
if to my sword his fate be not the glory
a thousand complete courses of the sun
but in mine emulous honour let him die
with every joint a wound and that to-morrow

we know each other well

we do and long to know each other worse

this is the most despiteful gentle greeting
the noblest hateful love that e'er I heard of
what business lord so early

I was sent for to the king but why I know not

his purpose meets you twas to bring this Greek
to Calchas' house and there to render him
for the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid
haste there before us I constantly do think
or rather call my thought a certain knowledge
my brother Troilus lodges there to-night
rouse him and give him note of our approach
with the whole quality wherefore I fear
we shall be much unwelcome

that I assure you
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
than Cressid borne from Troy

there is no help
the bitter disposition of the time
will have it so On lord we'll follow you

good morrow all


and tell me noble Diomed faith tell me true
who in your thoughts merits fair Helen best
myself or Menelaus

both alike
he merits well to have her that doth seek her
not making any scruple of her soilure
with such a hell of pain and world of charge
and you as well to keep her that defend her
not palating the taste of her dishonour
with such a costly loss of wealth and friends
he like a puling cuckold would drink up
the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
you like a lecher out of whorish loins
are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors
both merits pois'd each weighs nor less nor more
but he as he the heavier for a whore

you are too bitter to your country-woman

for every false drop in her bawdy veins
a Grecian's life hath sunk for every scruple
of her contaminated carrion weight
a Trojan hath been slain Since she could speak
she hath not given so many good words breath
as for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death

fair Diomed you do as chapmen do
dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
but we in silence hold this virtue well
we'll not commend what we intend to sell
here lies our way


dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold

then sweet my lord I'll call mine uncle down
he shall unbolt the gates

to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes
and give as soft attachment to thy senses
as infants' empty of all thought

good morrow then

I prithee now to bed

are you aweary of me

O Cressida but that the busy day
wak'd by the lark hath rous'd the ribald crows
and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer
I would not from thee

night hath been too brief

beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays
as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love
you will catch cold and curse me

prithee tarry
you men will never tarry
O foolish Cressid I might have still held off
and then you would have tarried Hark there's one up

what are all the doors open here

it is your uncle

a pestilence on him now will he be mocking I shall have such a life


how now how now how go maiden-heads
here you maid where's my cousin Cressid

go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle
you bring me to do and then you flout me too
to do what to do what let her say what what have I brought you to do

come come beshrew your heart you'll ne'er be good
nor suffer others

ha ha Alas poor wretch a poor capocchia hast not slept to-night would he not a naughty man let it sleep a bugbear take him

did not I tell you would he were knock'd o' the head

who's that at door good uncle go and see
my lord come you again into my chamber
you smile and mock me as if I meant naughtily

ha ha

come you are deceiv'd I think of no such thing

how earnestly they knock Pray you come in
I would not for half Troy have you seen here

who's there what's the matter will you beat down the door How now what's the matter


good morrow lord good morrow

who's there my Lord neas By my troth
I knew you not what news with you so early

is not Prince Troilus here

here what should he do here

come he is here my lord do not deny him it doth import him much to speak with me

is he here say you tis more than I know I'll be sworn for my own part I came in late What should he do here

who nay then come come you'll do him wrong ere you're ware You'll be so true to him to be false to him Do not you know of him but yet go fetch him hither go

how now what's the matter

my lord I scarce have leisure to salute you
my matter is so rash there is at hand
Paris your brother and Deiphobus
the Grecian Diomed and our Antenor
deliver'd to us and for him forthwith
ere the first sacrifice within this hour
we must give up to Diomedes' hand
the Lady Cressida

is it so concluded

by Priam and the general state of Troy
they are at hand and ready to effect it

how my achievements mock me
I will go meet them and my Lord neas
we met by chance you did not find me here
good good my lord the secrets of nature
have not more gift in taciturnity


is't possible no sooner got but lost
the devil take Antenor the young prince will go mad a plague upon Antenor I would they had broke's neck


how now What is the matter Who was here

Ah ah

why sigh you so profoundly where's my lord gone Tell me sweet uncle what's the matter

would I were as deep under the earth as I am above

O the gods what's the matter

prithee get thee in Would thou hadst ne'er been born I knew thou wouldst be his death O poor gentleman A plague upon Antenor
good uncle I beseech you on my knees I beseech you what's the matter

thou must be gone wench thou must be gone thou art changed for Antenor Thou must to thy father and be gone from Troilus twill be his death twill be his bane he cannot bear it

O you immortal gods I will not go

thou must

I will not uncle I have forgot my father
I know no touch of consanguinity
no kin no love no blood no soul so near me
as the sweet Troilus O you gods divine
make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood
if ever she leave Troilus Time force and death
do to this body what extremes you can
but the strong base and building of my love
is as the very centre of the earth
drawing all things to it I'll go in and weep


tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks
crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
with sounding Troilus I will not go from Troy


it is great morning and the hour prefix'd
of her delivery to this valiant Greek
comes fast upon Good my brother Troilus
tell you the lady what she is to do
and haste her to the purpose

walk into her house
I'll bring her to the Grecian presently
and to his hand when I deliver her
think it an altar and thy brother Troilus
a priest there offering to it his own heart


and would as I shall pity I could help
please you walk in my lords


be moderate be moderate

why tell you me of moderation
the grief is fine full perfect that I taste
and violenteth in a sense as strong
as that which causeth it how can I moderate it
if I could temporize with my affection
or brew it to a weak and colder palate
the like allayment could I give my grief
my love admits no qualifying dross
no more my grief in such a precious loss


here here here he comes Ah sweet ducks


what a pair of spectacles is here Let me embrace too O heart as the goodly saying is

O heart heavy heart
why sigh'st thou without breaking

when he answers again

because thou canst not ease thy smart
by friendship nor by speaking

there was never a truer rime Let us cast away nothing for we may live to have need of such a verse we see it we see it How now lambs

Cressid I love thee in so strain'd a purity
that the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy
more bright in zeal than the devotion which
cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me

have the gods envy
ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case

and is it true that I must go from Troy

a hateful truth

what and from Troilus too

from Troy and Troilus

is it possible

and suddenly where injury of chance
puts back leave-taking justles roughly by
all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows
even in the birth of our own labouring breath
we two that with so many thousand sighs
with the rude brevity and discharge of one
injurious time now with a robber's haste
crams his rich thievery up he knows not how
as many farewells as be stars in heaven
with distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them
he fumbles up into a loose adieu
and scants us with a single famish'd kiss
distasted with the salt of broken tears

my lord is the lady ready

hark you are call'd some say the Genius so
cries Come to him that instantly must die
bid them have patience she shall come anon

where are my tears rain to lay this wind or my heart will be blown up by the root


I must then to the Grecians
no remedy

a woeful Cressid mongst the merry Greeks
when shall we see again

hear me my love Be thou but true of heart

I true how now what wicked deem is this

nay we must use expostulation kindly
for it is parting from us
I speak not be thou true as fearing thee
for I will throw my glove to Death himself
that there's no maculation in thy heart
but be thou true say I to fashion in
my sequent protestation be thou true
and I will see thee

O you shall be expos'd my lord to dangers

and I'll grow friend with danger Wear this sleeve

and you this glove When shall I see you

I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels
to give thee nightly visitation
but yet be true

O heavens be true' again

hear why I speak it love
the Grecian youths are full of quality
they're loving well compos'd with gifts of nature
flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise
how novelty may move and parts with person
alas a kind of godly jealousy
which I beseech you call a virtuous sin
makes me afear'd
O heavens you love me not

die I a villain then
in this I do not call your faith in question
so mainly as my merit I cannot sing
nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
nor play at subtle games fair virtues all
to which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant
but I can tell that in each grace of these
there lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
that tempts most cunningly But be not tempted

do you think I will

no
but something may be done that we will not
and sometimes we are devils to ourselves
when we will tempt the frailty of our powers
presuming on their changeful potency
nay good my lord

come kiss and let us part

brother Troilus

good brother come you hither
and bring neas and the Grecian with you

my lord will you be true

who I alas it is my vice my fault
while others fish with craft for great opinion
I with great truth catch mere simplicity
whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns
with truth and plainness I do wear mine bare
fear not my truth the moral of my wit
is plain and true there's all the reach of it

welcome Sir Diomed Here is the lady
which for Antenor we deliver you
at the port lord I'll give her to thy hand
and by the way possess thee what she is
entreat her fair and by my soul fair Greek
if e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword
name Cressid and thy life shall be as safe

as Priam is in Ilion

fair Lady Cressid
so please you save the thanks this prince expects
the lustre in your eye heaven in your cheek
pleads your fair usage and to Diomed
you shall be mistress and command him wholly

Grecian thou dost not use me courteously
to shame the zeal of my petition to thee
in praising her I tell thee lord of Greece
as thou unworthy to be call'd her servant
I charge thee use her well even for my charge
for by the dreadful Pluto if thou dost not
though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard
I'll cut thy throat

O be not mov'd Prince Troilus
let me be privileg'd by my place and message
to be a speaker free when I am hence
I'll answer to my lust and know you lord
I'll nothing do on charge to her own worth
she shall be priz'd but that you say be't so
I'll speak it in my spirit and honour no

come to the port I'll tell thee Diomed
this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head
lady give me your hand and as you walk
to our own selves bend we our needful talk

hark Hector's trumpet

how have we spent this morning
the prince must think me tardy and remiss
that swore to ride before him to the field

'Tis Troilus' fault Come come to field with him

let us make ready straight

yea with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity
let us address to tend on Hector's heels
the glory of our Troy doth this day lie
on his fair worth and single chivalry


here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
anticipating time with starting courage
give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy
may pierce the head of the great combatant
and hale him hither

thou trumpet there's my purse
now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe
blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek
outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon
come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood
thou blow'st for Hector


no trumpet answers

'Tis but early days

is not yond Diomed with Calchas' daughter

'Tis he I ken the manner of his gait
he rises on the toe that spirit of his


is this the Lady Cressid

even she

most dearly welcome to the Greeks sweet lady

our general doth salute you with a kiss

yet is the kindness but particular
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general

and very courtly counsel I'll begin
so much for Nestor

I'll take that winter from your lips fair lady
Achilles bids you welcome


but that's no argument for kissing now
for thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment
and parted thus you and your argument

O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
for which we lose our heads to gild his horns

the first was Menelaus' kiss this mine
Patroclus kisses you

O this is trim

Paris and I kiss evermore for him

I'll have my kiss sir Lady by your leave

in kissing do you render or receive


I'll make my match to live
the kiss you take is better than you give
therefore no kiss

I'll give you boot I'll give you three for one

you're an odd man give even or give none

an odd man lady every man is odd

no Paris is not for you know tis true
that you are odd and he is even with you

you fillip me o' the head

no I'll be sworn

it were no match your nail against his horn

you may

I do desire it

why beg then

why then for Venus' sake give me a kiss
when Helen is a maid again and his

I am your debtor claim it when tis due

never's my day and then a kiss of you

lady a word I'll bring you to your father


a woman of quick sense

there's language in her eye her cheek her lip
nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out
at every joint and motive of her body
O these encounterers so glib of tongue
that give a coasting welcome ere it comes
and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
to every tickling reader set them down
for sluttish spoils of opportunity
and daughters of the game


the Trojans' trumpet

yonder comes the troop


hail all you state of Greece what shall be done
to him that victory commands or do you purpose
a victor shall be known will you the knights
pursue each other or shall be divided
by any voice or order of the field
Hector bade ask

which way would Hector have it

he cares not he'll obey conditions

'Tis done like Hector but securely done
a little proudly and great deal misprising
the knight oppos'd

if not Achilles sir
what is your name

if not Achilles nothing

therefore Achilles but whate'er know this
in the extremity of great and little
the one almost as infinite as all
the other blank as nothing Weigh him well
and that which looks like pride is courtesy
this Ajax is half made of Hector's blood
in love whereof half Hector stays at home
half heart half hand half Hector comes to seek
this blended knight half Trojan and half Greek

a maiden battle then O I perceive you


here is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight
stand by our Ajax as you and Lord neas
consent upon the order of their fight
so be it either to the uttermost
or else a breath the combatants being kin
half stints their strife before their strokes begin



what Trojan is that same that looks so heavy

the youngest son of Priam a true knight
not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
not soon provok'd nor being provok'd soon calm'd
his heart and hand both open and both free
for what he has he gives what thinks he shows
yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
nor dignifies an impure thought with breath
manly as Hector but more dangerous
for Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
to tender objects but he in heat of action
is more vindicative than jealous love
they call him Troilus and on him erect
a second hope as fairly built as Hector
thus says neas one that knows the youth
even to his inches and with private soul


they are in action

now Ajax hold thine own

Hector thou sleep'st awake thee

his blows are well dispos'd there Ajax

you must no more


princes enough so please you

I am not warm yet let us fight again

as Hector pleases

thou art great lord my father's sister's son
a cousin-german to great Priam's seed
the obligation of our blood forbids
a gory emulation twixt us twain
were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
that thou couldst say This hand is Grecian all
and this is Trojan the sinews of this leg
all Greek and this all Troy my mother's blood
runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
bounds in my father's by Jove multipotent
thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
wherein my sword had not impressure made
of our rank feud But the just gods gainsay
that any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother
my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
be drain'd Let me embrace thee Ajax
by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
Hector would have them fall upon him thus
cousin all honour to thee
I thank thee Hector
thou art too gentle and too free a man
I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
a great addition earned in thy death

not Neoptolemus so mirable
on whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st byes
cries This is he could promise to himself
a thought of added honour torn from Hector

there is expectance here from both the sides
what further you will do

we'll answer it
the issue is embracement Ajax farewell

if I might in entreaties find success
as seld I have the chance I would desire
my famous cousin to our Grecian tents
'Tis Agamemnon's wish and great Achilles
doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector

neas call my brother Troilus to me
and signify this loving interview
to the expecters of our Trojan part
desire them home Give me thy hand my cousin
I will go eat with thee and see your knights

great Agamemnon comes to meet us here

the worthiest of them tell me name by name
but for Achilles mine own searching eyes
shall find him by his large and portly size

worthy of arms as welcome as to one
that would be rid of such an enemy
but that's no welcome understand more clear
what's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
but in this extant moment faith and troth
strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing
bids thee with most divine integrity
from heart of very heart great Hector welcome

I thank thee most imperious Agamemnon

my well-fam'd Lord of Troy no less to you

let me confirm my princely brother's greeting
you brace of war-like brothers welcome hither

whom must we answer

the noble Menelaus

O you my lord by Mars his gauntlet thanks
mock not that I affect the untraded oath
your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove

name her not now sir she's a deadly theme

O pardon I offend

I have thou gallant Trojan seen thee oft
labouring for destiny make cruel way
through ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee
as hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed
Despising many forfeits and subduements
when thou hast hung thy advanc'd sword i' th' air
not letting it decline on the declin'd
that I have said to some my standers-by
'Lo Jupiter is yonder dealing life
and I have seen thee pause and take thy breath
when that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in
like an Olympian wrestling this have I seen
but this thy countenance still lock'd in steel
I never saw till now I knew thy grandsire
but by great Mars the captain of us all
never like thee Let an old man embrace thee
and worthy warrior welcome to our tents

'Tis the old Nestor

let me embrace thee good old chronicle
that hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time
most reverend Nestor I am glad to clasp thee

I would my arms could match thee in contention
as they contend with thee in courtesy

I would they could

ha
by this white beard I'd fight with thee to-morrow
well welcome welcome I have seen the time

when we have here her base and pillar by us

I know your favour Lord Ulysses well
Ah sir there's many a Greek and Trojan dead
since first I saw yourself and Diomed
in Ilion on your Greekish embassy

sir I foretold you then what would ensue
my prophecy is but half his journey yet
for yonder walls that pertly front your town
yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
must kiss their own feet

I must not believe you
there they stand yet and modestly I think
the fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
a drop of Grecian blood the end crowns all
and that old common arbitrator Time
will one day end it
so to him we leave it
most gentle and most valiant Hector welcome
after the general I beseech you next
to feast with me and see me at my tent

I shall forestall thee Lord Ulysses thou
now Hector I have fed mine eyes on thee
I have with exact view perus'd thee Hector
and quoted joint by joint

is this Achilles

I am Achilles

stand fair I pray thee let me look on thee

behold thy fill

nay I have done already
thou art too brief I will the second time
as I would buy thee view thee limb by limb

O like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er
but there's more in me than thou understand'st
why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye

tell me you heavens in which part of his body
shall I destroy him whether there or there or there
that I may give the local wound a name
and make distinct the very breach whereout
Hector's great spirit flew Answer me heavens

it would discredit the bless'd gods proud man
to answer such a question Stand again
think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
as to prenominate in nice conjecture
where thou wilt hit me dead


wert thou an oracle to tell me so
I'd not believe thee Henceforth guard thee well
for I'll not kill thee there nor there nor there
but by the forge that stithied Mars his helm
I'll kill thee every where yea o'er and o'er
you wisest Grecians pardon me this brag
his insolence draws folly from my lips
but I'll endeavour deeds to match these words
or may I never

do not chafe thee cousin
and you Achilles let these threats alone
till accident or purpose bring you to't
you may have every day enough of Hector
if you have stomach The general state I fear
can scarce entreat you to be odd with him

I pray you let us see you in the field
the Grecians' cause

dost thou entreat me Hector
to-morrow do I meet thee fell as death
to-night all friends

thy hand upon that match

first all you peers of Greece go to my tent
there in the full convive we afterwards
as Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
concur together severally entreat him
beat loud the tabourines let the trumpets blow
that this great soldier may his welcome know


my Lord Ulysses tell me I beseech you
in what place of the field doth Calchas keep

there Diomed doth feast with him to-night
who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth
but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
on the fair Cressid

shall I sweet lord be bound to thee so much
after we part from Agamemnon's tent
to bring me thither

you shall command me sir
as gentle tell me of what honour was
this Cressida in Troy Had she no lover there
that wails her absence

O sir to such as boasting show their scars
a mock is due Will you walk on my lord
she was belov'd she lov'd she is and doth
but still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth

I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night
which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow
Patroclus let us feast him to the height

here comes Thersites


how now thou core of envy
thou crusty batch of nature what's the news

why thou picture of what thou seemest and idol of idiot-worshippers here's a letter for thee

from whence fragment

why thou full dish of fool from Troy

who keeps the tent now

the surgeon's box or the patient's wound
well said adversity and what need these tricks

prithee be silent boy I profit not by thy talk thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet

male varlet you rogue what's that

why his masculine whore Now the rotten diseases of the south the guts-griping ruptures catarrhs loads o' gravel i' the back lethargies cold palsies raw eyes dirt-rotten livers wheezing lungs bladders full of imposthume sciaticas lime-kilns i' the palm incurable bone-ache and the rivelled fee-simple of the tetter take and take again such preposterous discoveries

why thou damnable box of envy thou what meanest thou to curse thus

do I curse thee

why no you ruinous butt you whoreson indistinguishable cur no

no why art thou then exasperate thou idle immaterial skein of sleave silk thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye thou tassel of a prodigal's purse thou Ah how the poor world is pestered with such water-flies diminutives of nature

out gall

finch egg
my sweet Patroclus I am thwarted quite
from my great purpose in to-morrow's battle
here is a letter from Queen Hecuba
a token from her daughter my fair love
both taxing me and gaging me to keep
an oath that I have sworn I will not break it
fall Greeks fail fame honour or go or stay
my major vow lies here this I'll obey
come come Thersites help to trim my tent
this night in banqueting must all be spent
away Patroclus


with too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad but if with too much brain and too little blood they do I'll be a curer of madmen Here's Agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails but he has not so much brain as ear-wax and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there his brother the bull the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain hanging at his brother's leg to what form but that he is should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to To an ass were nothing he is both ass and ox to an ox were nothing he is both ox and ass To be a dog a mule a cat a fitchew a toad a lizard an owl a puttock or a herring without a roe I would not care but to be Menelaus I would conspire against destiny Ask me not what I would be if I were not Thersites for I care not to be the louse of a lazar so I were not Menelaus Hey-day spirits and fires


we go wrong we go wrong

no yonder tis

I trouble you

no not a whit

here comes himself to guide you


welcome brave Hector welcome princes all

so now fair prince of Troy I bid good-night
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you

thanks and good-night to the Greeks' general

good-night my lord

good-night sweet Lord Menelaus


good-night and welcome both at once to those
that go or tarry

good-night


old Nestor tarries and you too Diomed
keep Hector company an hour or two

I cannot lord I have important business
the tide whereof is now Good-night great Hector

give me your hand

follow his torch he goes to Calchas' tent
I'll keep you company

sweet sir you honour me
and so good-night


come come enter my tent


that same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue a most unjust knave I will no more trust him when he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses He will spend his mouth and promise like Brabbler the hound but when he performs astronomers foretell it it is prodigious there will come some change the sun borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his word I will rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him they say he keeps a Trojan drab and uses the traitor Calchas' tent I'll after Nothing but lechery all incontinent varlets


what are you up here ho speak

who calls

Diomed Calchas I think Where's your daughter

she comes to you


stand where the torch may not discover us

Cressid comes forth to him

how now my charge

now my sweet guardian Hark a word with you


yea so familiar

she will sing any man at first sight

and any man may sing her if he can take her cliff she's noted

will you remember

remember yes

nay but do then

what should she remember

sweet honey Greek tempt me no more to folly

roguery

nay then

I'll tell you what

foh foh come tell a pin you are forsworn

in faith I cannot What would you have me do

a juggling trick to be secretly open


I prithee do not hold me to mine oath
bid me do anything but that sweet Greek

good-night

hold patience

how now Trojan

Diomed

no no good-night I'll be your fool no more

thy better must

hark one word in your ear

O plague and madness
you are mov'd prince let us depart I pray you
lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
to wrathful terms This place is dangerous
the time right deadly I beseech you go

behold I pray you

nay good my lord go off
you flow to great distraction come my lord

I pray thee stay

you have not patience come

I pray you stay By hell and all hell's torments
I will not speak a word

and so good-night


doth that grieve thee
O wither'd truth

why how now lord

by Jove
I will be patient

guardian why Greek

foh foh adieu you palter

in faith I do not come hither once again

you shake my lord at something will you go
you will break out

she strokes his cheek
come come

nay stay by Jove I will not speak a word
there is between my will and all offences
a guard of patience stay a little while

how the devil Luxury with his fat rump and potato finger tickles these together Fry lechery fry

but will you then

in faith I will la never trust me else

give me some token for the surety of it

I'll fetch you one


you have sworn patience

I will not be myself nor have cognition
of what I feel I am all patience


now the pledge now now now

here Diomed keep this sleeve

O beauty where is thy faith

my lord

I will be patient outwardly I will

you look upon that sleeve behold it well
he lov'd me O false wench Give't to me again

whose was't

I will not meet with you to-morrow night
I prithee Diomed visit me no more

now she sharpens well said whetstone

I shall have it

what this

ay that

O all you gods O pretty pretty pledge
thy master now lies thinking in his bed
of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove
and gives me norial dainty kisses to it
as I kiss thee Nay do not snatch it from me
he that takes that doth take my heart withal

I had your heart before this follows it
I did swear patience

you shall not have it Diomed faith you shall not
I'll give you something else

I will have this Whose was it

'Tis no matter

come tell me whose it was

'Twas one's that loved me better than you will
but now you have it take it

whose was it

by all Diana's waiting-women yond
and by herself I will not tell you whose

and grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it

wert thou the devil and wor'st it on thy horn
it should be challeng'd

well well tis done tis past and yet it is not
I will not keep my word

why then farewell
thou never shalt mock Diomed again

you shall not go one cannot speak a word
but it straight starts you

I do not like this fooling

nor I by Pluto but that that likes not me
pleases me best


ay come O Jove
do come I shall be plagu'd

farewell till then

good-night I prithee come

Troilus farewell one eye yet looks on thee
but with my heart the other eye doth see
Ah poor our sex this fault in us I find
the error of our eye directs our mind
what error leads must err O then conclude
minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude


a proof of strength she could not publish more
unless she said My mind is now turn'd whore


it is

why stay we then

to make a recordation to my soul
of every syllable that here was spoke
but if I tell how these two did co-act
shall I not lie in publishing a truth
sith yet there is a credence in my heart
an esperance so obstinately strong
that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears
as if those organs had deceptions functions
created only to calumniate
was Cressid here

I cannot conjure Trojan

she was not sure
most sure she was

why my negation hath no taste of madness

nor mine my lord Cressid was here but now

let it not be believ'd for womanhood
think we had mothers do not give advantage
to stubborn critics apt without a theme
for depravation to square the general sex
by Cressid's rule rather think this not Cressid

what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers

nothing at all unless that this were she

will he swagger himself out on's own eyes

this she no this is Diomed's Cressida
if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimony
if sanctimony be the gods' delight
if there be rule in unity itself
this is not she O madness of discourse
that cause sets up with and against itself
bi-fold authority where reason can revolt
without perdition and loss assume all reason
without revolt this is and is not Cressid
within my soul there doth conduce a fight
of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
divides more wider than the sky and earth
and yet the spacious breadth of this division
admits no orifice for a point as subtle
as Ariachne's broken woof to enter
instance O instance strong as Pluto's gates
Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
instance O instance strong as heaven itself
the bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolv'd and loos'd
and with another knot five-finger-tied
the fragments scraps the bits and greasy reliques
of her o'er-eaten faith are bound to Diomed

may worthy Troilus be half attach'd
with that which here his passion doth express

ay Greek and that shall be divulged well
in characters as red as Mars his heart
inflam'd with Venus never did young man fancy
with so eternal and so fix'd a soul
hark Greek as much as I do Cressid love
so much by weight hate I her Diomed
that sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm
were it a casque compos'd by Vulcan's skill
my sword should bite it Not the dreadful spout
which shipmen do the hurricano call
constring'd in mass by the almighty sun
shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
in his descent than shall my prompted sword

he'll tickle it for his concupy

O Cressid O false Cressid false false false
let all untruths stand by thy stained name
and they'll seem glorious

O contain yourself
your passion draws ears hither


I have been seeking you this hour my lord
Hector by this is arming him in Troy
Ajax your guard stays to conduct you home

have with you prince My courteous lord adieu
farewell revolted fair and Diomed
stand fast and wear a castle on thy head


accept distracted thanks


would I could meet that rogue Diomed I would croak like a raven I would bode I would bode Patroclus would give me any thing for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab Lechery lechery still wars and lechery nothing else holds fashion A burning devil take them


when was my lord so much ungently temper'd
to stop his ears against admonishment
unarm unarm and do not fight to-day

you train me to offend you get you in
by all the everlasting gods I'll go

my dreams will sure prove ominous to the day

no more I say



here sister arm'd and bloody in intent
consort with me in loud and dear petition
pursue we him on knees for I have dream'd
of bloody turbulence and this whole night
hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter

O tis true

ho bid my trumpet sound

no notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother

be gone I say the gods have heard me swear

the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
they are polluted offerings more abhorr'd
than spotted livers in the sacrifice

to hurt by being just it is as lawful
for we would give much to use violent thefts
and rob in the behalf of charity

it is the purpose that makes strong the vow
but vows to every purpose must not hold
unarm sweet Hector

hold you still I say
mine honour keeps the weather of my fate
life every man holds dear but the dear man
holds honour far more precious-dear than life

how now young man mean'st thou to fight to-day

Cassandra call my father to persuade


no faith young Troilus doff thy harness youth
let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong
and tempt not yet the brushes of the war
unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy
I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy

brother you have a vice of mercy in you
which better fits a lion than a man

what vice is that good Troilus chide me for it

when many times the captive Grecian falls
even in the fan and wind of your fair sword
you bid them rise and live

O tis fair play

fool's play by heaven Hector

how now how now
for the love of all the gods
let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers
and when we have our armours buckled on
the venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords
spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth

fie savage fie

Hector then tis wars

Troilus I would not have you fight to-day

who should withhold me
not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars
beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire
not Priamus and Hecuba on knees
their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears
nor you my brother with your true sword drawn
oppos'd to hinder me should stop my way


lay hold upon him Priam hold him fast
he is thy crutch now if thou lose thy stay
thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee
fall all together

come Hector come go back
thy wife hath dream'd thy mother hath had visions
Cassandra doth foresee and I myself
am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
to tell thee that this day is ominous
therefore come back

neas is a-field
and I do stand engag'd to many Greeks
even in the faith of valour to appear
this morning to them


I must not break my faith
you know me dutiful therefore dear sir
let me not shame respect but give me leave
to take that course by your consent and voice
which you do here forbid me royal Priam

O Priam yield not to him

do not dear father

Andromache I am offended with you
upon the love you bear me get you in


this foolish dreaming superstitious girl
makes all these bodements

O farewell dear Hector
look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents
hark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries out
how poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth
behold distraction frenzy and amazement
like witless anticks one another meet
and all cry Hector Hector's dead O Hector

away Away

farewell Yet soft Hector I take my leave
thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive


you are amaz'd my liege at her exclaim
go in and cheer the town we'll forth and fight
do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night

farewell the gods with safety stand about thee

they are at it hark Proud Diomed believe
I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve


do you hear my lord do you hear

what now

here's a letter come from yond poor girl

let me read

a whoreson tisick a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles me and the foolish fortune of this girl and what one thing what another that I shall leave you one o' these days and I have a rheum in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones that unless a man were cursed I cannot tell what to think on't What says she there

words words mere words no matter from the heart
the effect doth operate another way

go wind to wind there turn and change together
my love with words and errors still she feeds


now they are clapper-clawing one another I'll go look on That dissembling abominable varlet Diomed has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's sleeve of Troy there in his helm I would fain see them meet that that same young Trojan ass that loves the whore there might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab on a sleeveless errand O' the other side the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old mouse-eaten dry cheese Nestor and that same dog-fox Ulysses is not proved worth a blackberry they set me up in policy that mongrel cur Ajax against that dog of as bad a kind Achilles and now is the cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles and will not arm to-day whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism and policy grows into an ill opinion Soft here comes sleeve and t' other


fly not for shouldst thou take the river Styx
I would swim after

thou dost miscall retire
I do not fly but advantageous care
withdrew me from the odds of multitude
have at thee

hold thy whore Grecian now for thy whore Trojan now the sleeve now the sleeve

what art thou Greek art thou for Hector's match
art thou of blood and honour

no no I am a rascal a scurvy railing knave a very filthy rogue
I do believe thee live


God-a-mercy that thou wilt believe me but a plague break thy neck for frighting me What's become of the wenching rogues I think they have swallowed one another I would laugh at that miracle yet in a sort lechery eats itself I'll seek them


go go my servant take thou Troilus' horse
present the fair steed to my Lady Cressid
fellow commend my service to her beauty
tell her I have chastis'd the amorous Trojan
and am her knight by proof

I go my lord

renew renew The fierce Polydamas
hath beat down Menon bastard Margarelon
hath Doreus prisoner
and stands colossus-wise waving his beam
upon the pashed corses of the kings
amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt
Patroclus ta'en or slain and Palamedes
sore hurt and bruis'd the dreadful Sagittary
appals our numbers haste we Diomed
to reinforcement or we perish all


go bear Patroclus' body to Achilles
and bid the snail-pac'd Ajax arm for shame
there is a thousand Hectors in the field
now here he fights on Galathe his horse
and there lacks work anon he's there afoot
and there they fly or die like scaled sculls
before the belching whale then is he yonder
and there the strawy Greeks ripe for his edge
fall down before him like the mower's swath
here there and everywhere he leaves and takes
dexterity so obeying appetite
that what he will he does and does so much


O courage courage princes great Achilles
is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance
Patroclus' wounds have rous'd his drowsy blood
together with his mangled Myrmidons
that noseless handless hack'd and chipp'd come to him
crying on Hector Ajax hath lost a friend
and foams at mouth and he is arm'd and at it
roaring for Troilus who hath done to-day
mad and fantastic execution
engaging and redeeming of himself
with such a careless force and forceless care
as if that luck in very spite of cunning
bade him win all


Troilus thou coward Troilus

ay there there

so so we draw together


where is this Hector
come come thou boy-queller show thy face
know what it is to meet Achilles angry
Hector where's Hector I will none but Hector


Troilus thou coward Troilus show thy head


Troilus I say where's Troilus

what wouldst thou

I would correct him
were I the general thou shouldst have my office
ere that correction Troilus I say what Troilus


O traitor Diomed Turn thy false face thou traitor
and pay thy life thou ow'st me for my horse

ha art thou there

I'll fight with him alone stand Diomed

he is my prize I will not look upon

come both you cogging Greeks have at you both

yea Troilus O well fought my youngest brother


now I do see thee Ha have at thee Hector
pause if thou wilt

I do disdain thy courtesy proud Trojan
be happy that my arms are out of use
my rest and negligence befriend thee now
but thou anon shalt hear of me again
till when go seek thy fortune


fare thee well
I would have been much more a fresher man
had I expected thee How now my brother


Ajax hath ta'en neas shall it be
no by the flame of yonder glorious heaven
he shall not carry him I'll be ta'en too
or bring him off Fate hear me what I say
I reck not though I end my life to-day
stand stand thou Greek thou art a goodly mark
no wilt thou not I like thy armour well
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all
but I'll be master of it Wilt thou not beast abide
why then fly on I'll hunt thee for thy hide


come here about me you my Myrmidons
mark what I say Attend me where I wheel
strike not a stroke but keep yourselves in breath
and when I have the bloody Hector found
empale him with your weapons round about
in fellest manner execute your aims
follow me sirs and my proceedings eye
it is decreed Hector the great must die

the cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it Now bull now dog Loo Paris loo now my double-henned sparrow loo Paris loo The bull has the game ware horns ho

turn slave and fight
what art thou

a bastard son of Priam's

I am a bastard too I love bastards I am a bastard begot bastard instructed bastard in mind bastard in valour in every thing illegitimate One bear will not bite another and wherefore should one bastard Take heed the quarrel's most ominous to us if the son of a whore fight for a whore he tempts judgment Farewell bastard


the devil take thee coward


most putrefied core so fair without
thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life
now is my day's work done I'll take good breath
rest sword thou hast thy fill of blood and death

look Hector how the sun begins to set
how ugly night comes breathing at his heels
even with the vail and darking of the sun
to close the day up Hector's life is done
I am unarm'd forego this vantage Greek

strike fellows strike this is the man I seek

so Ilion fall thou next now Troy sink down
here lies thy heart thy sinews and thy bone
on Myrmidons and cry you all amain
'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain

hark a retreat upon our Grecian part

the Trojan trumpets sound the like my lord

the dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth
and stickler-like the armies separates
my half-supp'd sword that frankly would have fed
pleas'd with this dainty bait thus goes to bed

come tie his body to my horse's tail


hark hark what shout is that

peace drums


Achilles
Achilles Hector's slain Achilles

the bruit is Hector's slain and by Achilles

if it be so yet bragless let it be
great Hector was a man as good as he

march patiently along Let one be sent
to pray Achilles see us at our tent
if in his death the gods have us befriended
great Troy is ours and our sharp wars are ended
stand ho yet are we masters of the field
never go home here starve we out the night


Hector is slain

Hector the gods forbid

he's dead and at the murderer's horse's tail
in beastly sort dragg'd through the shameful field
frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed
sit gods upon your thrones and smile at Troy
I say at once let your brief plagues be mercy
and linger not our sure destructions on

my lord you do discomfort all the host

you understand me not that tell me so
I do not speak of flight of fear of death
address their dangers in Hector is gone
who shall tell Priam so or Hecuba
let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd
go in to Troy and say there Hector's dead
there is a word will Priam turn to stone
make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives
cold statues of the youth and in a word
scare Troy out of itself But march away
Hector is dead there is no more to say
stay yet You vile abominable tents
thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains
let Titan rise as early as he dare
I'll through and through you And thou great-siz'd coward
no space of earth shall sunder our two hates
I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still
that mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts
strike a free march to Troy with comfort go
hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe


hence broker lackey ignomy and shame
pursue thy life and live aye with thy name


a goodly medicine for my aching bones O world world world thus is the poor agent despised O traitors and bawds how earnestly are you set a-work and how ill requited why should our endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed what verse for it what instance for it Let me see

full merrily the humble-bee doth sing
till he hath lost his honey and his sting
and being once subdu'd in armed tail
sweet honey and sweet notes together fail

good traders in the flesh set this in your painted cloths

as many as be here of pander's hall
your eyes half out weep out at Pandar's fall
or if you cannot weep yet give some groans
though not for me yet for your aching bones
brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade
it should be now but that my fear is this
some galled goose of Winchester would hiss
till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases
and at that time bequeath you my diseases

TWELFTH-NIGHT; OR WHAT YOU WILL


if music be the food of love play on
give me excess of it that surfeiting
the appetite may sicken and so die
that strain again it had a dying fall
O it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
that breathes upon a bank of violets
stealing and giving odour Enough no more
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before
O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou
that notwithstanding thy capacity
receiveth as the sea nought enters there
but falls into abatement and low price
even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy
that it alone is high fantastical

will you go hunt my lord

what Curio

the hart

why so I do the noblest that I have
O when mine eyes did see Olivia first
methought she purg'd the air of pestilence
that instant was I turn'd into a hart
and my desires like fell and cruel hounds
e'er since pursue me

how now what news from her

but from her handmaid do return this answer
the element itself till seven years' heat
shall not behold her face at ample view
but like a cloistress she will veiled walk
and water once a day her chamber round
with eve-offending brine all this to season
a brother's dead love which she would keep fresh
and lasting in her sad remembrance

O she that hath a heart of that fine frame
to pay this debt of love but to a brother
how will she love when the rich golden shaft
hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
that live in her when liver brain and heart
these sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill'd
her sweet perfections with one self king
away before me to sweet beds of flowers
love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers

what country friends is this

this is Illyria lady

and what should I do in Illyria
my brother he is in Elysium
perchance he is not drown'd what think you sailors

it is perchance that you yourself were sav'd

O my poor brother and so perchance may he be

true madam and to comfort you with chance
assure yourself after our ship did split
when you and those poor number sav'd with you
hung on our driving boat I saw your brother
most provident in peril bind himself
courage and hope both teaching him the practice
to a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
so long as I could see

for saying so there's gold
mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope
whereto thy speech serves for authority
the like of him Know'st thou this country

ay madam well for I was bred and born
not three hours' travel from this very place

who governs here

a noble duke in nature as in name

what is his name

Orsino

he was a bachelor then

and so is now or was so very late
for but a month ago I went from hence
and then twas fresh in murmur as you know
what great ones do the less will prattle of
that he did seek the love of fair Olivia

what's she

a virtuous maid the daughter of a count
that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her
in the protection of his son her brother
who shortly also died for whose dear love
they say she hath abjur'd the company
and sight of men

O that I serv'd that lady
and might not be deliver'd to the world
what my estate is

that were hard to compass
because she will admit no kind of suit
no not the duke's

there is a fair behaviour in thee captain
and though that nature with a beauteous wall
doth oft close in pollution yet of thee
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
with this thy fair and outward character
I prithee and I'll pay thee bounteously
conceal me what I am and be my aid
for such disguise as haply shall become
the form of my intent I'll serve this duke
thou shalt present me as a eunuch to him
it may be worth thy pains for I can sing
and speak to him in many sorts of music
that will allow me very worth his service
only shape thou thy silence to my wit

be you his eunuch and your mute I'll be
when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see

I thank thee lead me on


what a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus I am sure care's an enemy to life

by my troth Sir Toby you must come in earlier o' nights your cousin my lady takes great exceptions to your ill hours

why let her except before excepted

ay but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order

confine I'll confine myself no finer than I am These clothes are good enough to drink in and so be these boots too an they be not let them hang themselves in their own straps

that quaffing and drinking will undo you I heard my lady talk of it yesterday and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer
who Sir Andrew Aguecheek

ay he

he's as tall a man as any's in Illyria

what's that to the purpose

why he has three thousand ducats a year

ay but he'll have but a year in all these ducats he's a very fool and a prodigal

fie that you'll say so he plays o' the viol-de-gamboys and speaks three or four languages word for word without book and hath all the good gifts of nature

he hath indeed almost natural for besides that he's a fool he's a great quarreller and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave

by this hand they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him Who are they

they that add moreover he's drunk nightly in your company
with drinking healths to my niece I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria He's a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' the toe like a parish-top What wench Castiliano vulgo for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface


sir Toby Belch how now Sir Toby Belch

sweet Sir Andrew

bless you fair shrew

and you too sir

accost Sir Andrew accost

what's that

my niece's chambermaid

good Mistress Accost I desire better acquaintance


good Mistress Mary Accost

you mistake knight accost' is front her board her woo her assail her

by my troth I would not undertake her in this company Is that the meaning of accost

fare you well gentlemen

an thou let her part so Sir Andrew would thou mightst never draw sword again

an you part so mistress I would I might never draw sword again Fair lady do you think you have fools in hand

sir I have not you by the hand

marry but you shall have and here's my hand

now sir thought is free I pray you bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink


it's dry sir

why I think so I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry But what's your jest

a dry jest sir

are you full of them

ay sir I have them at my fingers' ends marry now I let go your hand I am barren


O knight thou lackest a cup of canary when did I see thee so put down

never in your life I think unless you see canary put me down Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has but I am a great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit

no question

an I thought that I'd forswear it

pourquoi my dear knight

what is pourquoi do or not do I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing dancing and bear-baiting O had I but followed the arts

then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair

why would that have mended my hair

past question for thou seest it will not curl by nature

but it becomes me well enough does't not

excellent it hangs like flax on a distaff and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off

faith I'll home to-morrow Sir Toby your niece will not be seen or if she be it's four to one she'll none of me The count himself here hard by woos her

she'll none o' the count she'll not match above her degree neither in estate years nor wit I have heard her swear it Tut there's life in't man


art thou good at these kickchawses knight

as any man in Illyria whatsoever he be under the degree of my betters and yet I will not compare with an old man

what is thy excellence in a galliard knight

faith I can cut a caper

and I can cut the mutton to't

and I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria

wherefore are these things hid wherefore have these gifts a curtain before em are they like to take dust like Mistress Mall's picture why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto My very walk should be a jig I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace What dost thou mean is it a world to hide virtues in I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard

ay tis strong and it does indifferent well in a flame-coloured stock Shall we set about some revels

what shall we do else were we not born under Taurus


no sir it is legs and thighs Let me see thee caper Ha higher ha ha excellent


if the duke continue these favours towards you Cesario you are like to be much advanced he hath known you but three days and already you are no stranger

you either fear his humour or my negligence that you call in question the continuance of his love Is he inconstant sir in his favours

no believe me

I thank you Here comes the count


who saw Cesario ho

on your attendance my lord here

stand you awhile aloof Cesario
thou know'st no less but all I have unclasp'd
therefore good youth address thy gait unto her
be not denied access stand at her doors
and tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
till thou have audience

sure my noble lord
if she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
as it is spoke she never will admit me

be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
rather than make unprofited return

say I do speak with her my lord what then

O then unfold the passion of my love
surprise her with discourse of my dear faith
it shall become thee well to act my woes
she will attend it better in thy youth
than in a nuncio of more grave aspect
I think not so my lord

dear lad believe it
for they shall yet belie thy happy years
that say thou art a man Diana's lip
is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe
is as the maiden's organ shrill and sound
and all is semblative a woman's part
I know thy constellation is right apt
for this affair Some four or five attend him
all if you will for I myself am best
when least in company Prosper well in this
and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
to call his fortunes thine

I'll do my best
to woo your lady

yet a barful strife


nay either tell me where thou hast been or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse My lady will hang thee for thy absence

let her hang me he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours

make that good

he shall see none to fear

a good lenten answer I can tell thee where that saying was born of I fear no colours

where good Mistress Mary

in the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery

well God give them wisdom that have it and those that are fools let them use their talents

yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you
many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and for turning away let summer bear it out

you are resolute then

not so neither but I am resolved on two points

that if one break the other will hold or if both break your gaskins fall

apt in good faith very apt Well go thy way if Sir Toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria

peace you rogue no more o' that Here comes my lady make your excuse wisely you were best


wit an't be thy will put me into good fooling Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools and I that am sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man for what says Quinapalus Better a witty fool than a foolish wit

God bless thee lady

take the fool away


go to you're a dry fool I'll no more of you besides you grow dishonest

two faults madonna that drink and good counsel will amend for give the dry fool drink then is the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if he cannot let the botcher mend him Any thing that's mended is but patched virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that amends is but patched with virtue If that this simple syllogism will serve so if it will not what remedy As there is no true cuckold but calamity so beauty's a flower The lady bade take away the fool therefore I say again take her away

sir I bade them take away you

misprision in the highest degree Lady cucullus non facit monachum that's as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain Good madonna give me leave to prove you a fool

can you do it

dexteriously good madonna

make your proof

I must catechise you for it madonna good my mouse of virtue answer me

well sir for want of other idleness I'll bide your proof


good fool for my brother's death

I think his soul is in hell madonna

I know his soul is in heaven fool

the more fool madonna to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven Take away the fool gentlemen

what think you of this fool Malvolio doth he not mend

yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the better fool

God send you sir a speedy infirmity for the better increasing your folly Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool

how say you to that Malvolio

I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone Look you now he's out of his guard already unless you laugh and minister occasion to him he is gagged I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies


now Mercury endue thee with leasing for thou speakest well of fools


madam there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you

from the Count Orsino is it

I know not madam tis a fair young man and well attended

who of my people hold him in delay

sir Toby madam your kinsman

fetch him off I pray you he speaks nothing but madman Fie on him


now you see sir how your fooling grows old and people dislike it



by mine honour half drunk What is he at the gate cousin

a gentleman

a gentleman what gentleman

'Tis a gentleman here a plague o' these pickle herring How now sot

good Sir Toby

cousin cousin how have you come so early by this lethargy

lechery I defy lechery There's one at the gate

ay marry what is he

let him be the devil an he will I care not give me faith say I Well it's all one

what's a drunken man like fool

like a drowned man a fool and a madman one draught above heat makes him a fool the second mads him and a third drowns him

go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o' my coz for he's in the third degree of drink he's drowned go look after him

he is but mad yet madonna and the fool shall look to the madman

madam yond young fellow swears he will speak with you I told him you were sick he takes on him to understand so much and therefore comes to speak with you I told him you were asleep he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore comes to speak with you What is to be said to him lady he's fortified against any denial

tell him he shall not speak with me

ha's been told so and he says he'll stand at your door like a sheriff's post and be the supporter to a bench but he'll speak with you

what kind o' man is he

why of mankind


of very ill manner he'll speak with you will you or no

of what personage and years is he

not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for a boy as a squash is before tis a peascod or a codling when tis almost an apple tis with him in standing water between boy and man He is very well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him

let him approach Call in my gentlewoman

gentlewoman my lady calls

give me my veil come throw it o'er my face
we'll once more hear Orsino's embassy


the honourable lady of the house which is she

speak to me I shall answer for her
your will
most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beauty I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house for I never saw her I would be loath to cast away my speech for besides that it is excellently well penned I have taken great pains to con it Good beauties let me sustain no scorn I am very comptible even to the least sinister usage

whence came you sir

I can say little more than I have studied and that question's out of my part Good gentle one give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house that I may proceed in my speech

are you a comedian

no my profound heart and yet by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play Are you the lady of the house

if I do not usurp myself I am

most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve But this is from my commission I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message

come to what is important in't I forgive you the praise

alas I took great pains to study it and tis poetical

it is the more like to be feigned I pray you keep it in I heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you If you be not mad be gone if you have reason be brief tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue
will you hoist sail sir here lies your way

no good swabber I am to hull here a little longer Some mollification for your giant sweet lady

tell me your mind

I am a messenger

sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when the courtesy of it is so fearful Speak your office

it alone concerns your ear I bring no overture of war no taxation of homage I hold the olive in my hand my words are as full of peace as matter

yet you began rudely What are you what would you

the rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my entertainment What I am and what I would are as secret as maiden-head to your ears divinity to any other's profanation

give us the place alone we will hear this divinity

now sir what is your text
most sweet lady

a comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it Where lies your text

in Orsino's bosom

in his bosom In what chapter of his bosom

to answer by the method in the first of his heart

O I have read it it is heresy Have you no more to say

good madam let me see your face

have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face you are now out of your text but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture

look you sir such a one I was as this present is't not well done

excellently done if God did all
'Tis in grain sir twill endure wind and weather

'Tis beauty truly blent whose red and white
nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on
lady you are tho cruell'st she alive
if you will lead these graces to the grave
and leave the world no copy

O sir I will not be so hard-hearted I will give out divers schedules of my beauty it shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labelled to my will as Item Two lips indifferent red Item Two grey eyes with lids to them Item One neck one chin and so forth Were you sent hither to praise me

I see you what you are you are too proud
but if you were the devil you are fair
my lord and master loves you O such love
could be but recompens'd though you were crown'd
the nonpareil of beauty

how does he love me

with adorations with fertile tears

your lord does know my mind I cannot love him
yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble
of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
in voices well divulg'd free learn'd and valiant
and in dimension and the shape of nature
a gracious person but yet I cannot love him
he might have took his answer long ago

if I did love you in my master's flame
with such a suffering such a deadly life
in your denial I would find no sense
I would not understand it

why what would you

make me a willow cabin at your gate
and call upon my soul within the house
write loyal cantons of contemned love
holla your name to the reverberate hills
and make the babbling gossip of the air
cry out Olivia O you should not rest
between the elements of air and earth
but you should pity me

you might do much What is your parentage

above my fortune yet my state is well
I am a gentleman

get you to your lord
I cannot love him Let him send no more
unless perchance you come to me again
to tell me how he takes it Fare you well
I thank you for your pains spend this for me

I am no fee'd post lady keep your purse
my master not myself lacks recompense
and let your fervour like my master's be
plac'd in contempt Farewell fair cruelty


'What is your parentage
'Above my fortunes yet my state is well
I am a gentleman I'll be sworn thou art
thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit
do give thee five-fold blazon Not too fast soft soft
unless the master were the man How now
even so quickly may one catch the plague
methinks I feel this youth's perfections
with an invisible and subtle stealth
to creep in at mine eyes Well let it be
what ho Malvolio


here madam at your service

the county's man he left this ring behind him
would I or not tell him I'll none of it
desire him not to flatter with his lord
nor hold him up with hopes I'm not for him
if that the youth will come this way to-morrow
I'll give him reasons for't Hie thee Malvolio

madam I will


I do I know not what and fear to find
mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind
fate show thy force ourselves we do not owe
what is decreed must be and be this so

will you stay no longer nor will you not that I go with you

by your patience no My stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you


no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself You must know of me then Antonio my name is Sebastian which I called Roderigo My father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of He left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased would we had so ended but you sir altered that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned

alas the day

a lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful but though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that yet thus far I will boldly publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair She is drowned already sir with salt water though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more

pardon me sir your bad entertainment

O good Antonio forgive me your trouble

if you will not murder me for my love let me be your servant

if you will not undo what you have done that is kill him whom you have recovered desire it not Fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me I am bound to the Count Orsino's court farewell


the gentleness of all the gods go with thee
I have many enemies in Orsino's court
else would I very shortly see thee there
that danger shall seem sport and I will go


were not you even now with the Countess Olivia

even now sir on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither

she returns this ring to you sir you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself She adds moreover that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him And one thing more that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to report your lord's taking of this Receive it so

she took the ring of me I'll none of it

come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so returned if it be worth stooping for there it lies in your eye if not be it his that finds it


I left no ring with her what means this lady
fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her
she made good view of me indeed so much
that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue
for she did speak in starts distractedly
invites me in this churlish messenger
none of my lord's ring why he sent her none
I am the man if it be so as tis
poor lady she were better love a dream
disguise I see thou art a wickedness
wherein the pregnant enemy does much
how easy is it for the proper-false
in women's waxen hearts to set their forms
alas our frailty is the cause not we
for such as we are made of such we be
how will this fadge My master loves her dearly
and I poor monster fond as much on him
and she mistaken seems to dote on me
what will become of this As I am man
my state is desperate for my master's love
as I am woman now alas the day
what thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe
O time thou must untangle this not I
it is too hard a knot for me to untie

approach Sir Andrew not to be a-bed after midnight is to be up betimes and diluculo surgere thou knowest

nay by my troth I know not but I know to be up late is to be up late

a false conclusion I hate it as an unfilled can To be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes Does not our life consist of the four elements

faith so they say but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking

thou art a scholar let us therefore eat and drink Marian I say a stoup of wine


here comes the fool i' faith

how now my hearts Did you never see the picture of we three

welcome ass Now let's have a catch

by my troth the fool has an excellent breast I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg and so sweet a breath to sing as the fool has In sooth thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus twas very good i' faith I sent thee sixpence for thy leman hadst it
I did impeticos thy gratillity for Malvolio's nose is no whipstock my lady has a white hand and the Myrmidons are no bottleale houses

excellent Why this is the best fooling when all is done Now a song

come on there is sixpence for you let's have a song

there's a testril of me too if one knight give a

would you have a love-song or a song of good life

a love-song a love-song

ay ay I care not for good life


O mistress mine where are you roaming
O stay and hear your true love's coming
that can sing both high and low
trip no further pretty sweeting
every wise man's son doth know


excellent good i' faith

good good


what is love tis not hereafter
present mirth hath present laughter
what's to come is still unsure
in delay there lies no plenty
then come kiss me sweet and twenty
youth's a stuff will not endure


a mellifluous voice as I am true knight

a contagious breath
very sweet and contagious i' faith

to hear by the nose it is dulcet in contagion But shall we make the welkin dance indeed Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver shall we do that

an you love me let's do't I am dog at a catch

by'r lady sir and some dogs will catch well

most certain Let our catch be Thou knave

hold thy peace thou knave knight I shall be constrain'd in't to call thee knave knight

'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave Begin fool it begins Hold thy peace

I shall never begin if I hold my peace

good i' faith Come begin

what a caterwauling do you keep here If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors never trust me
my lady's a Cataian we are politicians Malvolio's a Peg-a-Ramsey and Three merry men be we Am not I consanguineous am I not of her blood Tillyvally lady
there dwelt a man in Babylon lady lady

beshrew me the knight's in admirable fooling

ay he does well enough if he be disposed and so do I too he does it with a better grace but I do it more natural

O the twelfth day of December

for the love o' God peace


my masters are you mad or what are you Have you no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night Do ye make an alehouse of my lady's house that ye squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice Is there no respect of place persons nor time in you

we did keep time sir in our catches Sneck up

sir Toby I must be round with you My lady bade me tell you that though she harbours you as her kinsman she's nothing allied to your disorders If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours you are welcome to the house if not an it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell

farewell dear heart since I must needs be gone
nay good Sir Toby

his eyes do show his days are almost done

is't even so

but I will never die

sir Toby there you lie

this is much credit to you

shall I bid him go

what an if you do

shall I bid him go and spare not

O no no no no you dare not
'Out o' time Sir ye lie Art any more than a steward Dost thou think because thou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale

yes by Saint Anne and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too

thou'rt i' the right Go sir rub your chain with crumbs A stoup of wine Maria

mistress Mary if you prized my lady's favour at anything more than contempt you would not give means for this uncivil rule she shall know of it by this hand


go shake your ears

'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him

do't knight I'll write thee a challenge or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth

sweet Sir Toby be patient for to-night since the youth of the count's was to-day with my lady she is much out of quiet For Monsieur Malvolio let me alone with him if I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed I know I can do it

possess us possess us tell us something of him


O if I thought that I'd beat him like a dog

what for being a puritan thy exquisite reason dear knight

I have no exquisite reason for't but I have reason good enough

the devil a puritan that he is or anything constantly but a time-pleaser an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths the best persuaded of himself so crammed as he thinks with excellences that it is his ground of faith that all that look on him love him and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work

what wilt thou do

I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated I can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands

excellent I smell a device

I have't in my nose too

he shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my niece and that she is in love with him


and your horse now would make him an ass

ass I doubt not

O twill be admirable

sport royal I warrant you I know my physic will work with him I will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter observe his construction of it For this night to bed and dream on the event Farewell


good night Penthesilea

before me she's a good wench

she's a beagle true-bred and one that adores me what o' that

I was adored once too

let's to bed knight Thou hadst need send for more money
if I cannot recover your niece I am a foul way out

send for money knight if thou hast her not i' the end call me cut

if I do not never trust me take it how you will

come come I'll go burn some sack tis too late to go to bed now Come knight come knight


give me some music Now good morrow friends
now good Cesario but that piece of song
that old and antique song we heard last night
methought it did relieve my passion much
more than light airs and recollected terms
of these most brisk and giddy-paced times
come but one verse

he is not here so please your lordship that should sing it


feste the jester my lord a fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in He is about the house

seek him out and play the tune the while

come hither boy if ever thou shalt love
in the sweet pangs of it remember me
for such as I am all true lovers are
unstaid and skittish in all motions else
save in the constant image of the creature
that is belov'd How dost thou like this tune

it gives a very echo to the seat
where love is thron'd

thou dost speak masterly
my life upon't young though thou art thine eye
hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves
hath it not boy
a little by your favour

what kind of woman is't

of your complexion

she is not worth thee then What years i' faith

about your years my lord

too old by heaven Let still the woman take
an elder than herself so wears she to him
so sways she level in her husband's heart
for boy however we do praise ourselves
our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
more longing wavering sooner lost and worn
than women's are

I think it well my lord
then let thy love be younger than thyself
or thy affection cannot hold the bent
for women are as roses whose fair flower
being once display'd doth fall that very hour

and so they are alas that they are so
to die even when they to perfection grow


O fellow come the song we had last night
mark it Cesario it is old and plain
the spinsters and the knitters in the sun
and the free maids that weave their thread with bones
do use to chant it it is silly sooth
and dallies with the innocence of love
like the old age

are you ready sir



come away come away death
and in sad cypress let me be laid
fly away fly away breath
I am slain by a fair cruel maid
my shroud of white stuck all with yew
O prepare it
my part of death no one so true
did share it


not a flower not a flower sweet
on my black coffin let there be strown
not a friend not a friend greet
my poor corse where my bones shall be thrown
a thousand thousand sighs to save
lay me O where
sad true lover never find my grave


there's for thy pains

no pains sir I take pleasure in singing sir

I'll pay thy pleasure then

truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another

give me now leave to leave thee

now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal I would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing Farewell


let all the rest give place

once more Cesario
get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
prizes not quantity of dirty lands
the parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her
tell her I hold as giddily as fortune
but tis that miracle and queen of gems
that nature pranks her in attracts my soul

but if she cannot love you sir

I cannot be so answer'd

sooth but you must
say that some lady as perhaps there is
hath for your love as great a pang of heart
as you have for Olivia you cannot love her
you tell her so must she not then be answer'd

there is no woman's sides
can bide the beating of so strong a passion
as love doth give my heart no woman's heart
alas their love may be call'd appetite
no motion of the liver but the palate
that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
but mine is all as hungry as the sea
and can digest as much Make no compare
between that love a woman can bear me
and that I owe Olivia

ay but I know

what dost thou know

too well what love women to men may owe
in faith they are as true of heart as we
my father had a daughter lov'd a man
as it might be perhaps were I a woman
I should your lordship

and what's her history
a blank my lord She never told her love
but let concealment like a worm i' the bud
feed on her damask cheek she pin'd in thought
and with a green and yellow melancholy
she sat like Patience on a monument
smiling at grief Was not this love indeed
we men may say more swear more but indeed
our shows are more than will for still we prove
much in our vows but little in our love

but died thy sister of her love my boy

I am all the daughters of my father's house
and all the brothers too and yet I know not
sir shall I to this lady

ay that's the theme
to her in haste give her this jewel say
my love can give no place bide no denay

come thy ways Signior Fabian

nay I'll come if I lose a scruple of this sport let me be boiled to death with melancholy

wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame

I would exult man you know he brought me out o' favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here

to anger him we'll have the bear again and we will fool him black and blue shall we not Sir Andrew

an we do not it is pity of our lives

here comes the little villain

how now my metal of India

get ye all three into the box-tree Malvolio's coming down this walk he has been yonder i' the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half-hour Observe him for the love of mockery for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him Close in the name of jesting Lie thou there


'Tis but fortune all is fortune Maria once told me she did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion Besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her What should I think on't

here's an over-weening rogue

O peace Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him how he jets under his advanced plumes

'Slight I could so beat the rogue

peace I say

to be Count Malvolio

Ah rogue

Pistol him pistol him

peace peace


fie on him Jezebel

O peace now he's deeply in look how imagination blows him

having been three months married to her sitting in my state

O for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye

calling my officers about me in my branched velvet gown having come from a daybed where I have left Olivia sleeping

fire and brimstone

O peace peace

and then to have the humour of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman Toby

bolts and shackles


seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him I frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with my some rich jewel Toby approaches curtsies there to me

shall this fellow live

though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace

I extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control

and does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then

saying Cousin Toby my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech

what what

'You must amend your drunkenness

out scab


'Besides you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight

that's me I warrant you

'One Sir Andrew

I knew twas I for many do call me fool

what employment have we here

now is the woodcock near the gin

O peace and the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him

by my life this is my lady's hand these be her very C's her U's and her T's and thus makes she her great P's It is in contempt of question her hand

her C's her U's and her T's why that


this wins him liver and all


Jove knows I love
but who
lips do not move
no man must know

'No man must know What follows the numbers altered No man must know if this should be thee Malvolio

marry hang thee brock


I may command where I adore
but silence like a Lucrece knife
with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore
M O A I doth sway my life

a fustian riddle

excellent wench say I

'M O A I doth sway my life Nay but first let me see let me see let me see

what dish o' poison has she dressed him

and with what wing the staniel checks at it

'I may command where I adore Why she may command me I serve her she is my lady Why this is evident to any formal capacity there is no obstruction in this And the end what should that alphabetical position portend if I could make that resemble something in me Softly M O A I

O ay make up that he is now at a cold scent

sowter will cry upon t for all this though it be as rank as a fox

M Malvolio M why that begins my name

did not I say he would work it out the cur is excellent at faults
M But then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation A should follow but O does

and O shall end I hope

ay or I'll cudgel him and make him cry O

and then I comes behind

ay an you had any eye behind you you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you

M O A I this simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters are in my name Soft here follows prose

if this fall into thy hand revolve In my stars I am above thee but be not afraid of greatness some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them Thy Fates open their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh Be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity She thus advises thee that sighs for thee Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered I say remember Go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so if not let me see thee a steward still the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers Farewell She that would alter services with thee THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY

daylight and champian discovers not more this is open I will be proud I will read politic authors I will baffle Sir Toby I will wash off gross acquaintance I will be point-devise the very man I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me She did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being cross-gartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking I thank my stars I am happy I will be strange stout in yellow stockings and cross-gartered even with the swiftness of putting on Jove and my stars be praised Here is yet a postscript

thou canst not choose but know who I am If thou entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling thy smiles become thee well therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet I prithee

Jove I thank thee I will smile I will do everything that thou wilt have me

I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy

I could marry this wench for this device

so could I too

and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest

nor I neither

here comes my noble gull-catcher


wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck

or o' mine either

shall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become thy bond-slave
i' faith or I either

why thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad

nay but say true does it work upon him

like aqua-vit with a midwife

if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow stockings and tis a colour she abhors and cross-gartered a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt If you will see it follow me

to the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of wit

I'll make one too

save thee friend and thy music Dost thou live by thy tabor

no sir I live by the church

art thou a churchman
no such matter sir I do live by the church for I do live at my house and my house doth stand by the church

so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the church

you have said sir To see this age
a sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward

nay that's certain they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton

I would therefore my sister had had no name sir

why man

why sir her name's a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton But indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them

thy reason man

troth sir I can yield you none without words and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them


not so sir I do care for something but in my conscience sir I do not care for you if that be to care for nothing sir I would it would make you invisible

art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool

no indeed sir the Lady Olivia has no folly she will keep no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings the husband's the bigger I am indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words

I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's

foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun it shines every where I would be sorry sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress I think I saw your wisdom there

nay an thou pass upon me I'll no more with thee Hold there's sixpence for thee


now Jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard

by my troth I'll tell thee I am almost sick for one though I would not have it grow on my chin Is thy lady within

would not a pair of these have bred sir
yes being kept together and put to use

I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir to bring a Cressida to this Troilus

I understand you sir tis well begg'd

the matter I hope is not great sir begging but a beggar Cressida was a beggar My lady is within sir I will conster to them whence you come who you are and what you would are out of my welkin I might say element but the word is overworn


this fellow's wise enough to play the fool
and to do that well craves a kind of wit
he must observe their mood on whom he jests
the quality of persons and the time
and like the haggard check at every feather
that comes before his eye This is a practice
as full of labour as a wise man's art
for folly that he wisely shows is fit
but wise men folly-fall'n quite taint their wit

save you gentleman

and you sir

Dieu vous garde monsieur

et vous aussi votre serviteur

I hope sir you are and I am yours

will you encounter the house my niece is desirous you should enter if your trade be to her

I am bound to your niece sir I mean she is the list of my voyage

taste your legs sir put them to motion

my legs do better understand me sir than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs

I mean to go sir to enter
I will answer you with gait and entrance But we are prevented

most excellent accomplished lady the heavens rain odours on you

that youth's a rare courtier Rain odours well

my matter hath no voice lady but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear

'Odours pregnant and vouchsafed I'll get em all three all ready

let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing

give me your hand sir

my duty madam and most humble service

what is your name

Cesario is your servant's name fair princess
my servant sir Twas never merry world
since lowly feigning was call'd compliment
you're servant to the Count Orsino youth

and he is yours and his must needs be yours
your servant's servant is your servant madam

for him I think not on him for his thoughts
would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me

madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts
on his behalf

O by your leave I pray you
I bade you never speak again of him
but would you undertake another suit
I had rather hear you to solicit that
than music from the spheres


give me leave beseech you I did send
after the last enchantment you did here
a ring in chase of you so did I abuse
myself my servant and I fear me you
under your hard construction must I sit
to force that on you in a shameful cunning
which you knew none of yours what might you think
have you not set mine honour at the stake
and baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts
that tyrannous heart can think To one of your receiving
enough is shown a cypress not a bosom
hideth my heart So let me hear you speak

I pity you

that's a degree to love

no not a grize for tis a vulgar proof

why then methinks tis time to smile again
O world how apt the poor are to be proud
if one should be a prey how much the better
to fall before the lion than the wolf

the clock upbraids me with the waste of time
be not afraid good youth I will not have you
and yet when wit and youth is come to harvest
your wife is like to reap a proper man
there lies your way due west

then westward-ho
Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship
you'll nothing madam to my lord by me

stay
I prithee tell me what thou think'st of me


if I think so I think the same of you

then think you right I am not what I am

I would you were as I would have you be

would it be better madam than I am
I wish it might for now I am your fool

O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
in the contempt and anger of his lip
a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
than love that would seem hid love's night is noon
Cesario by the roses of the spring
by maidhood honour truth and every thing
I love thee so that maugre all thy pride
nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
do not extort thy reasons from this clause
but rather reason thus with reason fetter
love sought is good but giv'n unsought is better

by innocence I swear and by my youth
I have one heart one bosom and one truth
and that no woman has nor never none
shall mistress be of it save I alone
and so adieu good madam never more
will I my master's tears to you deplore

yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move
that heart which now abhors to like his love


no faith I'll not stay a jot longer

thy reason dear venom give thy reason

you must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew
marry I saw your niece do more favours to the count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me I saw't i' the orchard

did she see thee the while old boy tell me that

as plain as I see you now

this was a great argument of love in her toward you

'Slight will you make an ass o' me

I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason

and they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor

she did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver You should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness This was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman's beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy

an't be any way it must be with valour for policy I hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician

why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour challenge me the count's youth to fight with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valour
there is no way but this Sir Andrew

will either of you bear me a challenge to him

go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention taunt him with the licence of ink if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England set em down go about it Let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou write with a goose-pen no matter about it

where shall I find you

we'll call thee at the cubiculo go


this is a dear manakin to you Sir Toby

I have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or so

we shall have a rare letter from him but you'll not deliver it

never trust me then and by all means stir on the youth to an answer I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together For Andrew if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea I'll eat the rest of the anatomy


look where the youngest wren of nine comes


if you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches follow me Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen a very renegado for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness He's in yellow stockings

and cross-gartered

most villanously like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church I have dogged him like his murderer He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him he does smile his face into more lines than are in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies You have not seen such a thing as tis I can hardly forbear hurling things at him I know my lady will strike him if she do he'll smile and take't for a great favour

come bring us bring us where he is


I would not by my will have troubled you
but since you make your pleasure of your pains
I will no further chide you

I could not stay behind you my desire
more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth
as might have drawn one to a longer voyage
but jealousy what might befall your travel
being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
unguided and unfriended often prove
rough and unhospitable my willing love
the rather by these arguments of fear
set forth in your pursuit

my kind Antonio
I can no other answer make but thanks
and thanks and ever thanks for oft good turns
are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay
but were my worth as is my conscience firm
you should find better dealing What's to do
shall we go see the reliques of this town

to-morrow sir best first go see your lodging

I am not weary and tis long to night
with the memorials and the things of fame
that do renown this city

would you'd pardon me
I do not without danger walk these streets
once in a sea-fight gainst the Count his galleys
I did some service of such note indeed
that were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd

belike you slew great number of his people

the offence is not of such a bloody nature
albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
might well have given us bloody argument
it might have since been answer'd in repaying
what we took from them which for traffic's sake
most of our city did only myself stood out
for which if I be lapsed in this place
I shall pay dear
do not then walk too open

it doth not fit me Hold sir here's my purse
in the south suburbs at the Elephant
is best to lodge I will bespeak our diet
whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
with viewing of the town there shall you have me

why I your purse

haply your eye shall light upon some toy
you have desire to purchase and your store
I think is not for idle markets sir

I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you for an hour

to the Elephant

I do remember

I have sent after him he says he'll come
how shall I feast him what bestow of him
for youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd
I speak too loud
where is Malvolio he is sad and civil
and suits well for a servant with my fortunes
where is Malvolio

he's coming madam but in very strange manner He is sure possess'd madam

why what's the matter does he rave

no madam he does nothing but smile your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is tainted in's wits

go call him hither

I am as mad as he
if sad and merry madness equal be
how now Malvolio

sweet lady ho ho

smil'st thou
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion

sad lady I could be sad this does make some obstruction in the blood this crossgartering but what of that if it please the eye of one it is with me as the very true sonnet is Please one and please all

why how dost thou man what is the matter with thee

not black in my mind though yellow in my legs It did come to his hands and commands shall be executed I think we do know the sweet Roman hand

wilt thou go to bed Malvolio

to bed ay sweetheart and I'll come to thee

God comfort thee Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft


at your request Yes nightingales answer daws

why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady

'Be not afraid of greatness Twas well writ

what meanest thou by that Malvolio

'Some are born great

ha

'Some achieve greatness

what sayst thou

'And some have greatness thrust upon them


'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings

thy yellow stockings

'And wished to see thee cross-gartered

cross-gartered

'Go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so

am I made

'If not let me see thee a servant still

why this is very midsummer madness


madam the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned I could hardly entreat him back he attends your ladyship's pleasure
I'll come to him

good Maria let this fellow be looked to Where's my cousin Toby Let some of my people have a special care of him I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry


oh ho do you come near me now no worse man than Sir Toby to look to me This concurs directly with the letter she sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that in the letter Cast thy humble slough says she be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity and consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of some sir of note and so forth I have limed her but it is Jove's doing and Jove make me thankful And when she went away now Let this fellow be looked to fellow not Malvolio nor after my degree but fellow Why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe circumstance What can be said Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes Well Jove not I is the doer of this and he is to be thanked


which way is he in the name of sanctity If all the devils in hell be drawn in little and Legion himself possess'd him yet I'll speak to him

here he is here he is How is't with you sir how is't with you man

go off I discard you let me enjoy my private go off

lo how hollow the fiend speaks within him did not I tell you Sir Toby my lady prays you to have a care of him

Ah ha does she so

go to go to peace peace we must deal gently with him let me alone How do you Malvolio how is't with you What man defy the devil consider he's an enemy to mankind
do you know what you say

la you an you speak ill of the devil how he takes it at heart Pray God he be not bewitched

carry his water to the wise-woman

marry and it shall be done to-morrow morning if I live My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say

how now mistress

O Lord

prithee hold thy peace this is not the way do you not see you move him let me alone with him

no way but gentleness gently gently the fiend is rough and will not be roughly used

why how now my bawcock how dost thou chuck

sir
ay Biddy come with me What man tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan hang him foul collier

get him to say his prayers good Sir Toby get him to pray

my prayers minx

no I warrant you he will not hear of godliness

go hang yourselves all you are idle shallow things I am not of your element You shall know more hereafter


is't possible

if this were played upon a stage now I could condemn it as an improbable fiction

his very genius hath taken the infection of the device man

nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint


the house will be the quieter

come we'll have him in a dark room and bound My niece is already in the belief that he's mad we may carry it thus for our pleasure and his penance till our very pastime tired out of breath prompt us to have mercy on him at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen But see but see


more matter for a May morning

here's the challenge read it I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in't

is't so saucy

ay is't I warrant him do but read

give me Youth whatsoever thou art thou art but a scurvy fellow

good and valiant

wonder not nor admire not in thy mind why I do call thee so for I will show thee no reason for't
a good note that keeps you from the blow of the law

thou comest to the Lady Olivia and in my sight she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat that is not the matter I challenge thee for

very brief and to exceeding good sense less

I will waylay thee going home where if it be thy chance to kill me

good

thou killest me like a rogue and a villain

still you keep o' the windy side of the law good

fare thee well and God have mercy upon one of our souls He may have mercy upon mine but my hope is better and so look to thyself Thy friend as thou usest him and thy sworn enemy
if this letter move him not his legs cannot
I'll give't him

you may have very fit occasion for for't he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
go Sir Andrew scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-baily so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him Away

nay let me alone for swearing


now will not I deliver his letter for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole But sir I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour and drive the gentleman as I know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices

here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after him

I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge

I have said too much unto a heart of stone
and laid mine honour too unchary out
there's something in me that reproves my fault
but such a headstrong potent fault it is
that it but mocks reproof

with the same haviour that your passion bears
goes on my master's griefs
here wear this jewel for me tis my picture
refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you
and I beseech you come again to-morrow
what shall you ask of me that I'll deny
that honour sav'd may upon asking give

nothing but this your true love for my master

how with mine honour may I give him that
which I have given to you

I will acquit you

well come again to-morrow fare thee well
a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell

gentleman God save thee

and you sir
that defence thou hast betake thee to't of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard-end Dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick skilful and deadly

you mistake sir I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man

you'll find it otherwise I assure you therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal

I pray you sir what is he

he is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre Hob nob is his word give't or take't

I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady I am no fighter I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirk

sir no his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire Back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must that's certain or forswear to wear iron about you

this is as uncivil as strange I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is it is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose

I will do so Signior Fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return



I know the knight is incensed against you even to a mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more

I beseech you what manner of man is he

nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour He is indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria Will you walk towards him I will make your peace with him if I can

I shall be much bound to you for't I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight I care not who knows so much of my mettle

why man he's a very devil I have not seen such a firago I had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable and on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on They say he has been fencer to the Sophy

pox on't I'll not meddle with him

ay but he will not now be pacified Fabian can scarce hold him yonder

plague on't an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him Let him let the matter slip and I'll give him my horse grey Capilet

I'll make the motion Stand here make a good show on't this shall end without the perdition of souls


I have his horse to take up the quarrel I have persuaded him the youth's a devil

he is as horribly conceited of him and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his heels

there's no remedy sir he will fight with you for his oath's sake Marry he hath better bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of therefore draw for the supportance of his vow he protests he will not hurt you

pray God defend me A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man

give ground if you see him furious

come Sir Andrew there's no remedy the gentleman will for his honour's sake have one bout with you he cannot by the duello avoid it but he has promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he will not hurt you Come on to't

pray God he keep his oath


I do assure you tis against my will

put up your sword If this young gentleman
if you offend him I for him defy you


you sir why what are you

one sir that for his love dares yet do more
than you have heard him brag to you he will

nay if you be an undertaker I am for you


O good sir Toby hold here come the officers

I'll be with you anon

pray sir put your sword up if you please

marry will I sir and for that I promised you I'll be as good as my word He will bear you easily and reins well

this is the man do thy office

Antonio I arrest thee at the suit
of Count Orsino

you do mistake me sir

no sir no jot I know your favour well
though now you have no sea-cap on your head
take him away he knows I know him well

I must obey

this comes with seeking you
but there's no remedy I shall answer it
what will you do now my necessity
makes me to ask you for my purse It grieves me
much more for what I cannot do for you
than what befalls myself You stand amaz'd

come sir away

I must entreat of you some of that money

what money sir
for the fair kindness you have show'd me here
and part being prompted by your present trouble
out of my lean and low ability
I'll lend you something my having is not much
I'll make division of my present with you
hold there is half my coffer

will you deny me now
is't possible that my deserts to you
can lack persuasion Do not tempt my misery
lest that it make me so unsound a man
as to upbraid you with those kindnesses
that I have done for you
I know of none
nor know I you by voice or any feature
I hate ingratitude more in a man
than lying vainness babbling drunkenness
or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
inhabits our frail blood

O heavens themselves

come sir I pray you go

let me speak a little This youth that you see here
I snatch'd one-half out of the jaws of death
reliev'd him with such sanctity of love
and to his image which methought did promise
most venerable worth did I devotion

what's that to us The time goes by away

thou hast Sebastian done good feature shame
in nature there's no blemish but the mind
none can be call'd deform'd but the unkind
virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil
are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil

the man grows mad away with him Come come sir

lead me on


methinks his words do from such passion fly
that he believes himself so do not I
prove true imagination O prove true
that I dear brother be now ta'en for you

come hither knight come hither
Fabian we'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws

yet living in my glass even such and so
in favour was my brother and he went
still in this fashion colour ornament
for him I imitate O if it prove
tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love


a very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than a hare His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him and for his cowardship ask Fabian

a coward a most devout coward religious in it

'Slid I'll after him again and beat him

do cuff him soundly but never draw thy sword

an I do not


come let's see the event
I dare lay any money twill be nothing yet

will you make me believe that I am not sent for you

go to go to thou art a foolish fellow
let me be clear of thee

well held out i' faith No I do not know you nor I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her nor your name is not Master Cesario nor this is not my nose neither Nothing that is so is so

I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else
thou know'st not me

vent my folly He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool Vent my folly I am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney I prithee now ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady Shall I vent to her that thou art coming

I prithee foolish Greek depart from me
there's money for thee if you tarry longer
I shall give worse payment

by my troth thou hast an open hand


now sir have I met you again there's for you


why there's for thee and there and there and there

are all the people mad


hold sir or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house

this will I tell my lady straight I would not be in some of your coats for twopence


come on sir hold

nay let him alone I'll go another way to work with him I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria Though I struck him first yet it's no matter for that


come sir I will not let you go Come my young soldier put up your iron you are well fleshed come on

I will be free from thee

what wouldst thou now
if thou dar'st tempt me further draw thy sword

what what Nay then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you

hold Toby on thy life I charge thee hold

madam

will it be ever thus Ungracious wretch
fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves
where manners ne'er were preach'd Out of my sight
be not offended dear Cesario
rudesby be gone
I prithee gentle friend
let thy fair wisdom not thy passion sway
in this uncivil and unjust extent
against thy peace Go with me to my house
and hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
this ruffian hath botch'd up that thou thereby
mayst smile at this Thou shalt not choose but go
do not deny Beshrew his soul for me
he started one poor heart of mine in thee

what relish is in this how runs the stream
or I am mad or else this is a dream
let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep
if it be thus to dream still let me sleep

nay come I prithee Would thou'dst be rul'd by me

madam I will



nay I prithee put on this gown and this beard make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate do it quickly I'll call Sir Toby the whilst


well I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in't and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown I am not tall enough to become the function well nor lean enough to be thought a good student but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar The competitors enter


God bless thee Master parson

bonos dies Sir Toby for as the old hermit of Prague that never saw pen and ink very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc That that is is so I being Master parson am Master parson for what is that but that and is but is

to him Sir Topas

what ho I say Peace in this prison

the knave counterfeits well a good knave

who calls there
sir Topas the curate who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic

sir Topas Sir Topas good Sir Topas go to my lady

out hyperbolical fiend how vexest thou this man Talkest thou nothing but of ladies

well said Master Parson

sir Topas never was man thus wronged Good Sir Topas do not think I am mad they have laid me here in hideous darkness

fie thou dishonest Satan I call thee by the most modest terms for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy Sayst thou that house is dark

as hell Sir Topas

why it hath bay-windows transparent as barricadoes and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony and yet complainest thou of obstruction

I am not mad Sir Topas I say to you this house is dark

madman thou errest I say there is no darkness but ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog
I say this house is as dark as ignorance though ignorance were as dark as hell and I say there was never man thus abused I am no more mad than you are make the trial of it in any constant question

what is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl

that the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird

what thinkest thou of his opinion

I think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion

fare thee well remain thou still in darkness thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam Fare thee well

sir Topas Sir Topas

my most exquisite Sir Topas

nay I am for all waters

thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown he sees thee not
to him in thine own voice and bring me word how thou findest him I would we were well rid of this knavery If he may be conveniently delivered I would he were for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot Come by and by to my chamber

alas sir be patient What say you sir I am shent for speaking to you

good fool help me to some light and some paper I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria

well-a-day that you were sir

by this hand I am Good fool some ink paper and light and convey what I will set down to my lady it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did

I will help you to't But tell me true are you not mad indeed or do you but counterfeit

believe me I am not I tell thee true

nay I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains I will fetch you light and paper and ink

fool I'll requite it in the highest degree I prithee be gone


I am gone sir
I'll be with you again
in a trice
like to the old Vice
your need to sustain
who with dagger of lath
in his rage and his wrath
cries Ah ah to the devil
like a mad lad
pare thy nails dad
adieu goodman drivel

this is the air that is the glorious sun This pearl she gave me I do feel't and see't
and though tis wonder that enwraps me thus
yet tis not madness Where's Antonio then
I could not find him at the Elephant
yet there he was and there I found this credit
that he did range the town to seek me out
his counsel now might do me golden service
for though my soul disputes well with my sense
yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
so far exceed all instance all discourse
that I am ready to distrust mine eyes
and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
to any other trust but that I am mad
or else the lady's mad yet if twere so
she could not sway her house command her followers
take and give back affairs and their dispatch
with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
as I perceive she does There's something in't
that is deceivable But here the lady comes


blame not this haste of mine If you mean well
now go with me and with this holy man
into the chantry by there before him
and underneath that consecrated roof
plight me the full assurance of your faith
that my most jealous and too doubtful soul
whiles you are willing it shall come to note
what time we will our celebration keep
according to my birth What do you say

I'll follow this good man and go with you
and having sworn truth ever will be true

then lead the way good father and heavens so shine
that they may fairly note this act of mine


now as thou lovest me let me see his letter

good Master Fabian grant me another request

anything

do not desire to see this letter



belong you to the Lady Olivia friends

ay sir we are some of her trappings

I know thee well how dost thou my good fellow

truly sir the better for my foes and the worse for my friends

just the contrary the better for thy friends

no sir the worse

how can that be

marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass so that by my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends I am abused so that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes

why this is excellent
by my troth sir no though it please you to be one of my friends

thou shalt not be the worse for me there's gold

but that it would be double-dealing sir I would you could make it another

O you give me ill counsel

put your grace in your pocket sir for this once and let your flesh and blood obey it

well I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer there's another

primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old saying is the third pays for all the triplex sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of Saint Bennet sir may put you in mind one two three

you can fool no more money out of me at this throw if you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her and bring her along with you it may awake my bounty further

marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come again I go sir but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness but as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I will awake it anon




that face of his I do remember well
yet when I saw it last it was besmear'd
as black as Vulcan in the smoke of war
a bawbling vessel was he captain of
for shallow draught and hulk unprizable
with which such scathful grapple did he make
with the most noble bottom of our fleet
that very envy and the tongue of loss
cried fame and honour on him What's the matter

Orsino this is that Antonio
that took the Ph nix and her fraught from Candy
and this is he that did the Tiger board
when your young nephew Titus lost his leg
here in the streets desperate of shame and state
in private brabble did we apprehend him

but in conclusion put strange speech upon me
I know not what twas but distraction

notable pirate thou salt-water thief
what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
hast made thine enemies

Orsino noble sir
be pleas'd that I shake off these names you give me
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate
though I confess on base and ground enough
Orsino's enemy A witchcraft drew me hither
that most ingrateful boy there by your side
from the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth
did I redeem a wrack past hope he was
his life I gave him and did thereto add
my love without retention or restraint
all his in dedication for his sake
into the danger of this adverse town
drew to defend him when he was beset
where being apprehended his false cunning
not meaning to partake with me in danger
taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
and grew a twenty years removed thing
while one would wink denied me mine own purse
which I had recommended to his use
not half an hour before

how can this be

when came he to this town

to-day my lord and for three months before
no interim not a minute's vacancy
both day and night did we keep company


but for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness
three months this youth hath tended upon me
but more of that anon Take him aside

what would my lord but that he may not have
wherein Olivia may seem serviceable
Cesario you do not keep promise with me

madam

gracious Olivia

what do you say Cesario Good my lord

my lord would speak my duty hushes me

if it be aught to the old tune my lord
it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
as howling after music
still so cruel

still so constant lord

what to perverseness you uncivil lady
to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
my soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breath'd out
that e'er devotion tender'd What shall I do

even what it please my lord that shall become him

why should I not had I the heart to do it
like to the Egyptian thief at point of death
kill what I love a savage jealousy
that sometimes savours nobly But hear me this
since you to non-regardance cast my faith
and that I partly know the instrument
that screws me from my true place in your favour
live you the marble-breasted tyrant still
and whom by heaven I swear I tender dearly
him will I tear out of that cruel eye
where he sits crowned in his master's spite
come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief
I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love
to spite a raven's heart within a dove


and I most jocund apt and willingly
to do you rest a thousand deaths would die


where goes Cesario

after him I love
more than I love these eyes more than my life
more by all mores than e'er I shall love wife
if I do feign you witnesses above
punish my life for tainting of my love
Ah me detested how am I beguil'd

who does beguile you who does do you wrong

hast thou forgot thyself Is it so long
call forth the holy father


come away

whither my lord Cesario husband stay

husband

ay husband can he that deny

her husband sirrah

no my lord not I
alas it is the baseness of thy fear
that makes thee strangle thy propriety
fear not Cesario take thy fortunes up
be that thou know'st thou art and then thou art
as great as that thou fear'st


O welcome father
father I charge thee by thy reverence
here to unfold though lately we intended
to keep in darkness what occasion now
reveals before tis ripe what thou dost know

hath newly pass'd between this youth and me

a contract of eternal bond of love
confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands
attested by the holy close of lips
strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings
seal'd in my function by my testimony
since when my watch hath told me toward my grave
I have travell'd but two hours

O thou dissembling cub what wilt thou be
when time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case
or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow
farewell and take her but direct thy feet
where thou and I henceforth may never meet

my lord I do protest

O do not swear
hold little faith though thou hast too much fear


for the love of God a surgeon send one presently to Sir Toby


he has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too For the love of God your help I had rather than forty pound I were at home

who has done this Sir Andrew

the count's gentleman one Cesario we took him for a coward but he's the very devil incardinate

my gentleman Cesario

Od's lifelings here he is You broke my head for nothing and that that I did I was set on to do't by Sir Toby

why do you speak to me I never hurt you
you drew your sword upon me without cause
but I bespake you fair and hurt you not

if a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb Here comes Sir Toby halting

you shall hear more but if he had not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he did


that's all one he has hurt me and there's the end on't Sot didst see Dick surgeon sot

O he's drunk Sir Toby an hour agone his eyes were set at eight i' the morning

then he's a rogue and a passy-measures pavin I hate a drunken rogue

away with him Who hath made this havoc with them

I'll help you Sir Toby because we'll be dressed together

will you help an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave a thin-faced knave a gull

get him to bed and let his hurt be look'd to

I am sorry madam I have hurt your kinsman
but had it been the brother of my blood
I must have done no less with wit and safety
you throw a strange regard upon me and by that
pardon me sweet one even for the vows
we made each other but so late ago

one face one voice one habit and two persons
a natural perspective that is and is not

Antonio O my dear Antonio
how have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me
since I have lost thee

Sebastian are you

fear'st thou that Antonio

how have you made division of yourself
an apple cleft in two is not more twin
than these two creatures Which is Sebastian

most wonderful
do I stand there I never had a brother
nor can there be that deity in my nature
of here and every where I had a sister
whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd
of charity what kin are you to me
what countryman what name what parentage

of Messaline Sebastian was my father
such a Sebastian was my brother too
so went he suited to his watery tomb
if spirits can assume both form and suit
you come to fright us

a spirit I am indeed
but am in that dimension grossly clad
which from the womb I did participate
were you a woman as the rest goes even
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek
and say Thrice welcome drowned Viola
my father had a mole upon his brow

and so had mine

and died that day when Viola from her birth
had number'd thirteen years

O that record is lively in my soul
he finished indeed his mortal act
that day that made my sister thirteen years

if nothing lets to make us happy both
but this my masculine usurp'd attire
do not embrace me till each circumstance
of place time fortune do cohere and jump
that I am Viola which to confirm
I'll bring you to a captain in this town
where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
I was preserv'd to serve this noble count
hath been between this lady and this lord

so comes it lady you have been mistook
but nature to her bias drew in that
you would have been contracted to a maid
nor are you therein by my life deceiv'd
you are betroth'd both to a maid and man

be not amaz'd right noble is his blood
if this be so as yet the glass seems true
I shall have share in this most happy wrack


boy thou hast said to me a thousand times
thou never shouldst love woman like to me

and all those sayings will I over-swear
and all those swearings keep as true in soul
as doth that orbed continent the fire

give me thy hand
and let me see thee in thy woman's weeds

the captain that did bring me first on shore
hath my maid's garments he upon some action
is now in durance at Malvolio's suit
a gentleman and follower of my lady's

he shall enlarge him Fetch Malvolio hither
and yet alas now I remember me
they say poor gentleman he's much distract
a most extracting frenzy of mine own
from my remembrance clearly banish'd his

how does he sirrah

truly madam he holds Belzebub at the stave's end as well as a man in his case may do He has here writ a letter to you I should have given it to you to-day morning but as a madman's epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are delivered


look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman
by the Lord madam

how now art thou mad

no madam I do but read madness an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must allow vox

prithee read i' thy right wits

so I do madonna but to read his right wits is to read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear

read it you sirrah


by the Lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame Think of me as you please I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO

did he write this


this savours not much of distraction

see him deliver'd Fabian bring him hither

my lord so please you these things further thought on
to think me as well a sister as a wife
one day shall crown the alliance on't so please you
here at my house and at my proper cost

madam I am most apt to embrace your offer


your master quits you and for your service done him
so much against the mettle of your sex
so far beneath your soft and tender breeding
and since you call'd me master for so long
here is my hand you shall from this time be
your master's mistress
a sister you are she


is this the madman

ay my lord this same
how now Malvolio

madam you have done me wrong
notorious wrong

have I Malvolio no

lady you have Pray you peruse that letter
you must not now deny it is your hand
write from it if you can in hand or phrase
or say tis not your seal nor your invention
you can say none of this Well grant it then
and tell me in the modesty of honour
bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you
to put on yellow stockings and to frown
upon Sir Toby and the lighter people
and acting this in an obedient hope
why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd
kept in a dark house visited by the priest
and made the most notorious geck and gull
that e'er invention play'd on tell me why

alas Malvolio this is not my writing
though I confess much like the character
but out of question tis Maria's hand
and now I do bethink me it was she
first told me thou wast mad then cam'st in smiling
and in such forms which here were presuppos'd
upon thee in the letter Prithee be content
this practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee
but when we know the grounds and authors of it
thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge

good madam hear me speak
and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
taint the condition of this present hour
which I have wonder'd at In hope it shall not
most freely I confess myself and Toby
set this device against Malvolio here
upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
we had conceiv'd against him Maria writ
the letter at Sir Toby's great importance
in recompense whereof he hath married her
how with a sportful malice it was follow'd
may rather pluck on laughter than revenge
if that the injuries be justly weigh'd
that have on both sides past

alas poor fool how have they baffled thee

why some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrown upon them I was one sir in this interlude one Sir Topas sir but that's all one By the Lord fool I am not mad But do you remember Madam why laugh you at such a barren rascal an you smile not he's gagged and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
I'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you


he hath been most notoriously abus'd

pursue him and entreat him to a peace
he hath not told us of the captain yet
when that is known and golden time convents
a solemn combination shall be made
of our dear souls Meantime sweet sister
we will not part from hence Cesario come
for so you shall be while you are a man
but when in other habits you are seen
Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen

when that I was and a little tiny boy
with hey ho the wind and the rain
a foolish thing was but a toy
for the rain it raineth every day

but when I came to man's estate
with hey ho the wind and the rain
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gates
for the rain it raineth every day


but when I came alas to wive
with hey ho the wind and the rain
by swaggering could I never thrive
for the rain it raineth every day


but when I came unto my beds
with hey ho the wind and the rain
with toss-pots still had drunken heads
for the rain it raineth every day


with hey ho the wind and the rain
but that's all one our play is done
and we'll strive to please you every day

THE FAMOUS HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF KING HENRY VIII


I come no more to make you laugh things now
that bear a weighty and a serious brow
sad high and working full of state and woe
such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
we now present Those that can pity here
may if they think it well let fall a tear
the subject will deserve it Such as give
their money out of hope they may believe
may here find truth too Those that come to see
only a show or two and so agree
the play may pass if they be still and willing
I'll undertake may see away their shilling
that come to hear a merry bawdy play
a noise of targets or to see a fellow
in a long molley coat guarded with yellow
will be deceiv'd for gentle hearers know
to rank our chosen truth with such a show
as fool and fight is besides forfeiting
our own brains and the opinion that we bring
to make that only true we now intend
will leave us never an understanding friend
therefore for goodness' sake and as you are known
the first and happiest hearers of the town
be sad as we would make ye think ye see
the very persons of our noble story
as they were living think you see them great
and follow'd with the general throng and sweat
of thousand friends then in a moment see
how soon this mightiness meets misery
and if you can be merry then I'll say
a man may weep upon his wedding day

good morrow and well met How have you done
since last we saw in France

I thank your Grace
healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
of what I saw there

an untimely ague
stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
those suns of glory those two lights of men
met in the vale of Andren

'Twixt Guynes and Arde
I was then present saw them salute on horseback
beheld them when they lighted how they clung
in their embracement as they grew together
which had they what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd
such a compounded one
all the whole time
I was my chamber's prisoner

then you lost
the view of earthly glory men might say
till this time pomp was single but now married
to one above itself Each following day
became the next day's master till the last
made former wonders its To-day the French
all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
shone down the English and to-morrow they
made Britain India every man that stood
show'd like a mine Their dwarfish pages were
as cherubins all gilt the madams too
not us'd to toil did almost sweat to bear
the pride upon them that their very labour
was to them as a painting Now this masque
was cried incomparable and the ensuing night
made it a fool and beggar The two kings
as presence did present them him in eye
still him in praise and being present both
'Twas said they saw but one and no discerner
durst wag his tongue in censure When these suns
for so they phrase em by their heralds challeng'd
the noble spirits to arms they did perform
beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story
being now seen possible enough got credit
that Bevis was believ'd

O you go far

as I belong to worship and affect
in honour honesty the tract of every thing
would by a good discourser lose some life
which action's self was tongue to All was royal
to the disposing of it nought rebell'd
order gave each thing view the office did
distinctly his full function
who did guide
I mean who set the body and the limbs
of this great sport together as you guess

one certes that promises no element
in such a business

I pray you who my lord

all this was order'd by the good discretion
of the right reverend Cardinal of York

the devil speed him no man's pie is freed
from his ambitious finger What had he
to do in these fierce vanities I wonder
that such a keech can with his very bulk
take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
and keep it from the earth

there's in him stuff that puts him to these ends
for being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace
chalks successors their way nor call'd upon
for high feats done to the crown neither allied
to eminent assistants but spider-like
out of his self-drawing web he gives us note
the force of his own merit makes his way
a gift that heaven gives for him which buys
a place next to the king

I cannot tell
what heaven hath given him let some graver eye
pierce into that but I can see his pride
peep through each part of him whence has he that
if not from hell the devil is a niggard
or has given all before and he begins
a new hell in himself

why the devil
without the privity o' the king to appoint
who should attend on him He makes up the file
of all the gentry for the most part such
to whom as great a charge as little honour
he meant to lay upon and his own letter
the honourable board of council out
must fetch him in he papers

I do know
kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
by this so sicken'd their estates that never
they shall abound as formerly

O many
have broke their backs with laying manors on em
for this great journey What did this vanity
but minister communication of
a most poor issue

the peace between the French and us not values
the cost that did conclude it

every man
after the hideous storm that follow'd was
a thing inspir'd and not consulting broke
into a general prophecy That this tempest
dashing the garment of this peace aboded
the sudden breach on't

which is budded out
for France hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd
our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux

is it therefore
the ambassador is silenc'd

marry is't

at a superfluous rate

why all this business
our reverend cardinal carried

like it your Grace
the state takes notice of the private difference
betwixt you and the cardinal I advise you
and take it from a heart that wishes towards you
honour and plenteous safety that you read
the cardinal's malice and his potency
together to consider further that
what his high hatred would effect wants not
a minister in his power You know his nature
that he's revengeful and I know his sword
hath a sharp edge it's long and t may be said
it reaches far and where twill not extend
thither he darts it Bosom up my counsel
you'll find it wholesome Lo where comes that rock

the Duke of Buckingham's surveyor ha
where's his examination

here so please you

is he in person ready

ay please your Grace

well we shall then know more and Buckingham
shall lessen this big look


this butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd and I
have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
not wake him in his slumber A beggar's book
outworths a noble's blood

ask God for temperance that's the appliance only
which your disease requires

I read in's looks
matter against me and his eye revil'd
me as his abject object at this instant
he bores me with some trick he's gone to the king
I'll follow and out-stare him

stay my lord
and let your reason with your choler question
what tis you go about To climb steep hills
requires slow pace at first anger is like
a full-hot horse who being allow'd his way
self-mettle tires him Not a man in England
can advise me like you be to yourself
as you would to your friend

I'll to the king
this Ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim
there's difference in no persons

be advis'd
heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
that it do singe yourself We may outrun
by violent swiftness that which we run at
and lose by overrunning Know you not
the fire that mounts the liquor till it run o'er
in seeming to augment it wastes it Be advis'd
I say again there is no English soul
more stronger to direct you than yourself
if with the sap of reason you would quench
or but allay the fire of passion

sir
I am thankful to you and I'll go along
by your prescription but this top-proud fellow
whom from the flow of gall I name not but
and proofs as clear as founts in July when
we see each grain of gravel I do know
to be corrupt and treasonous

say not treasonous

to the king I'll say't and make my vouch as strong
as shore of rock Attend This holy fox
or wolf or both for he is equal ravenous
as he is subtle and as prone to mischief
as able to perform t his mind and place
infecting one another yea reciprocally
only to show his pomp as well in France
as here at home suggests the king our master
to this last costly treaty the interview
that swallow'd so much treasure and like a glass
did break i' the rinsing

faith and so it did
praygive me favour sir This cunning cardinal
the articles o' the combination drew
as himself pleas'd and they were ratified
as he cried Thus let be to as much end
as give a crutch to the dead But our count-cardinal
has done this and tis well for worthy Wolsey
who cannot err he did it Now this follows
which as I take it is a kind of puppy
to the old dam treason Charles the emperor
under pretence to see the queen his aunt
for twas indeed his colour but he came
to whisper Wolsey here makes visitation
his fears were that the interview betwixt
England and France might through their amity
breed him some prejudice for from this league
peep'd harms that menac'd him He privily
deals with our cardinal and as I trow
which I do well for I am sure the emperor
paid ere he promis'd whereby his suit was granted
and pav'd with gold the emperor thus desir'd
that he would please to alter the king's course
and break the foresaid peace Let the king know
as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal
does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
and for his own advantage

I am sorry
to hear this of him and could wish he were
something mistaken in t

no not a syllable
I do pronounce him in that very shape
he shall appear in proof


your office sergeant execute it

sir
of Hereford Stafford and Northampton I
arrest thee of high treason in the name
of our most sovereign king

lo you my lord
the net has fall'n upon me I shall perish
under device and practice

I am sorry
to see you ta'en from liberty to look on
the business present Tis his highness' pleasure
you shall to the Tower

it will help me nothing
to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me
which makes my whit'st part black The will of heaven
be done in this and all things I obey
O my Lord Abergavenny fare you well


the king
is pleas'd you shall to the Tower till you know
how he determines further

as the duke said
the will of heaven be done and the king's pleasure
by me obey'd

here is a warrant from
the king to attach Lord Montacute and the bodies
of the duke's confessor John de la Car
one Gilbert Peck his chancellor

so so
these are the limbs o' the plot no more I hope

a monk o' the Chartreux


he

my surveyor is false the o'er-great cardinal
hath show'd him gold My life is spann'd already
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham
whose figure even this instant cloud puts on
by dark'ning my clear sun My lord farewell


my life itself and the best heart of it
thanks you for this great care I stood i' the level
of a full-charg'd confederacy and give thanks
to you that chok'd it Let be call'd before us
that gentleman of Buckingham's in person
I'll hear him his confessions justify
and point by point the treasons of his master
he shall again relate


arise and take place by us half your suit
never name to us you have half our power
the other moiety ere you ask is given
repeat your will and take it

thank your majesty
that you would love yourself and in that love
not unconsider'd leave your honour nor
the dignity of your office is the point
of my petition

lady mine proceed

I am solicited not by a few
and those of true condition that your subjects
are in great grievance there have been commissions
sent down among em which hath flaw'd the heart
of all their loyalties wherein although
most bitterly on you as putter-on
of these exactions yet the king our master
whose honour heaven shield from soil even he escapes not
language unmannerly yea such which breaks
the sides of loyalty and almost appears
in loud rebellion

not almost appears
it doth appear for upon these taxations
the clothiers all not able to maintain
the many to them longing have put off
the spinsters carders fullers weavers who
unfit for other life compell'd by hunger
and lack of other means in desperate manner
daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar
and danger serves among them

taxation
wherein and what taxation My Lord Cardinal
know you of this taxation

please you sir
I know but of a single part in aught
pertains to the state and front but in that file
where others tell steps with me

no my lord
you know no more than others but you frame
things that are known alike which are not wholesome
to those which would not know them and yet must
perforce be their acquaintance These exactions
whereof my sov'reign would have note they are
most pestilent to the hearing and to bear em
the back is sacrifice to the load They say
they are devis'd by you or else you suffer
too hard an exclamation

still exaction
is this exaction

I am much too venturous
in tempting of your patience but am bolden'd
under your promis'd pardon The subjects' grief
comes through commissions which compel from each
the sixth part of his substance to be levied
without delay and the pretence for this
is nam'd your wars in France This makes bold mouths
tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
allegiance in them their curses now
live where their prayers did and it's come to pass
this tractable obedience is a slave
to each incensed will I would your highness
would give it quick consideration for
there is no primer business

by my life
this is against our pleasure
and for me
I have no further gone in this than by
a single voice and that not pass'd me but
by learned approbation of the judges If I am
traduc'd by ignorant tongues which neither know
my faculties nor person yet will be
the chronicles of my doing let me say
'Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake
that virtue must go through We must not stint
our necessary actions in the fear
to cope malicious censurers which ever
as rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow
that is new-trimm'd but benefit no further
than vainly longing What we oft do best
by sick interpreters once weak ones is
not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft
hitting a grosser quality is cried up
for our best act If we shall stand still
in fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at
state-statues only

things done well
and with a care exempt themselves from fear
things done without example in their issue
are to be fear'd Have you a precedent
of this commission I believe not any
we must not rend our subjects from our laws
and stick them in our will Sixth part of each
a trembling contribution Why we take
from every tree lop bark and part o' the timber
and though we leave it with a root thus hack'd
the air will drink the sap To every county
where this is question'd send our letters with
free pardon to each man that has denied
the force of this commission Pray look to t
I put it to your care

a word with you
of the king's grace and pardon The griev'd commons
hardly conceive of me let it be nois'd
that through our intercession this revokement
and pardon comes I shall anon advise you
further in the proceeding

I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
is run in your displeasure

it grieves many
the gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker
to nature none more bound his training such
that he may furnish and instruct great teachers
and never seek for aid out of himself Yet see
when these so noble benefits shall prove
not well dispos'd the mind growing once corrupt
they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
than ever they were fair This man so complete
who was enroll'd mongst wonders and when we
his hour of speech a minute he my lady
hath into monstrous habits put the graces
that once were his and is become as black
as if besmear'd in hell Sit by us you shall hear
this was his gentleman in trust of him
things to strike honour sad Bid him recount
the fore-recited practices whereof
we cannot feel too little hear too much

stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
most like a careful subject have collected
out of the Duke of Buckingham

speak freely

first it was usual with him every day
it would infect his speech that if the king
should without issue die he'd carry it so
to make the sceptre his These very words
lord Abergavenny to whom by oath he menac'd
revenge upon the cardinal

please your highness note
this dangerous conception in this point
not friended by his wish to your high person
his will is most malignant and it stretches
beyond you to your friends

my learn'd Lord Cardinal
deliver all with charity

speak on
how grounded he his title to the crown
upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him
at any time speak aught

he was brought to this
by a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins
what was that Hopkins

sir a Chartreux friar
his confessor who fed him every minute
with words of sovereignty

how know'st thou this

not long before your highness sped to France
the duke being at the Rose within the parish
Saint Lawrence Poultney did of me demand
what was the speech among the Londoners
concerning the French journey I replied
men fear'd the French would prove perfidious
to the king's danger Presently the duke
said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
spoke by a holy monk that oft says he
'Hath sent to me wishing me to permit
to hear from him a matter of some moment
whom after under the confession's seal
he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
my chaplain to no creature living but
to me should utter with demure confidence
this pausingly ensu'd neither the king nor s heirs
tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive
to gain the love o' the commonalty the duke
shall govern England

if I know you well
you were the duke's surveyor and lost your office
on the complaint o' the tenants take good heed
you charge not in your spleen a noble person
and spoil your nobler soul I say take heed
yes heartily beseech you

let him on
go forward
on my soul I'll speak but truth
I told my lord the duke by the devil's illusions
the monk might be deceiv'd and that twas dangerous for him
to ruminate on this so far until
it forg'd him some design which being believ'd
it was much like to do He answer'd Tush
it can do me no damage adding further
that had the king in his last sickness fail'd
the cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
should have gone off

ha what so rank Ah ha
there's mischief in this man Canst thou say further

I can my liege

proceed

being at Greenwich
about Sir William Blomer

I remember
of such a time being my sworn servant
the duke retain'd him his But on what hence

'If quoth he I for this had been committed
as to the Tower I thought I would have play'd
the part my father meant to act upon
the usurper Richard who being at Salisbury
made suit to come in s presence which if granted
as he made semblance of his duty would
have put his knife into him

a giant traitor

now madam may his highness live in freedom
and this man out of prison


there's something more would out of thee what sayst

after the duke his father with the knife
he stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger
another spread on's breast mounting his eyes
he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenour
was were he evil us'd he would outgo
his father by as much as a performance
does an irresolute purpose

there's his period
to sheathe his knife in us He is attach'd
call him to present trial if he may
find mercy in the law tis his if none
let him not seek't of us by day and night
he's traitor to the height


men into such strange mysteries

new customs
though they be never so ridiculous
nay let em be unmanly yet are follow'd

as far as I see all the good our English
have got by the late voyage is but merely
a fit or two o' the face but they are shrewd ones
for when they hold em you would swear directly
their very noses had been counsellors
to Pepin or Clotharius they keep state so

they have all new legs and lame ones one would take it
that never saw em pace before the spavin
or springhalt reign'd among em

death my lord
their clothes are after such a pagan cut too


how now

what news Sir Thomas Lovell

faith my lord
I hear of none but the new proclamation
that's clapp'd upon the court-gate

what is't for

the reformation of our travell'd gallants
that fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors

I am glad tis there now I would pray our monsieurs
to think an English courtier may be wise
and never see the Louvre

for so run the conditions leave those remnants
of fool and feather that they got in France
with all their honourable points of ignorance
pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks
abusing better men than they can be
out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean
the faith they have in tennis and tall stockings
short blister'd breeches and those types of travel
and understand again like honest men
or pack to their old playfellows there I take it
they may cum privilegio wear away
the lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at

'Tis time to give em physic their diseases
are grown so catching

what a loss our ladies
will have of these trim vanities

there will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresons
have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies
a French song and a fiddle has no fellow

the devil fiddle em I am glad they're going
for sure there's no converting of em now
an honest country lord as I am beaten
a long time out of play may bring his plainsong
and have an hour of hearing and by'r lady
held current music too

well said Lord Sands
your colt's tooth is not cast yet

no my lord
nor shall not while I have a stump

sir Thomas
whither were you a-going
to the cardinal's
your lordship is a guest too

O tis true
this night he makes a supper and a great one
to many lords and ladies there will be
the beauty of this kingdom I'll assure you

that churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed
a hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us
his dews fall everywhere

no doubt he's noble
he had a black mouth that said other of him

he may my lord he has wherewithal in him
sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine
men of his way should be most liberal
they are set here for examples
true they are so
but few now give so great ones My barge stays
your lordship shall along Come good Sir Thomas
we shall be late else which I would not be
for I was spoke to with Sir Henry Guildford
this night to be comptrollers

I am your lordship's

ladies a general welcome from his Grace
salutes ye all this night he dedicates
to fair content and you None here he hopes
in all this noble bevy has brought with her
one care abroad he would have all as merry
as first good company good wine good welcome
can make good people

O my lord you're tardy
the very thought of this fair company

you are young Sir Harry Guildford

sir Thomas Lovell had the cardinal
but half my lay-thoughts in him some of these
should find a running banquet ere they rested
I think would better please em by my life
they are a sweet society of fair ones

O that your lordship were but now confessor
to one or two of these

I would I were
they should find easy penance

faith how easy

as easy as a down-bed would afford it

place you that side I'll take the charge of this
his Grace is ent'ring Nay you must not freeze
two women plac'd together makes cold weather
my Lord Sands you are one will keep em waking
pray sit between these ladies

by my faith
and thank your lordship By your leave sweet ladies

if I chance to talk a little wild forgive me
I had it from my father

was he mad sir

O very mad exceeding mad in love too
but he would bite none just as I do now
he would kiss you twenty with a breath


so now you're fairly seated Gentlemen
the penance lies on you if these fair ladies
pass away frowning

for my little cure
let me alone


you're welcome my fair guests that noble lady
or gentleman that is not freely merry
is not my friend this to confirm my welcome
and to you all good health


your Grace is noble
let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks
and save me so much talking

my Lord Sands
ladies you are not merry gentlemen
whose fault is this

the red wine first must rise
in their fair cheeks my lord then we shall have em
talk us to silence

you are a merry gamester
my Lord Sands

yes if I make my play
here's to your ladyship and pledge it madam
for tis to such a thing

you cannot show me

I told your Grace they would talk anon



look out there some of ye


what war-like voice
and to what end is this Nay ladies fear not
by all the laws of war you're privileg'd


how now what is't

a noble troop of strangers
for so they seem they've left their barge and landed
and hither make as great ambassadors
from foreign princes

good Lord Chamberlain
go give em welcome you can speak the French tongue
and pray receive em nobly and conduct em
shall shine at full upon them Some attend him

you have now a broken banquet but we'll mend it
a good digestion to you all and once more
I shower a welcome on ye welcome all

a noble company what are their pleasures

because they speak no English thus they pray'd
to tell your Grace that having heard by fame
of this so noble and so fair assembly
this night to meet here they could do no less
out of the great respect they bear to beauty
but leave their flocks and under your fair conduct
crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
an hour of revels with em

say Lord Chamberlain
they have done my poor house grace for which I pay em


the fairest hand I ever touch'd O beauty
till now I never knew thee


my lord

your Grace

pray tell them thus much from me
there should be one amongst em by his person
more worthy this place than myself to whom
if I but knew him with my love and duty
I would surrender it

I will my lord



such a one they all confess
there is indeed which they would have your Grace
find out and he will take it

let me see then

by all your good leaves gentlemen here I'll make
my royal choice

you have found him cardinal
you hold a fair assembly you do well lord
you are a churchman or I'll tell you cardinal
I should judge now unhappily

I am glad
your Grace is grown so pleasant

my Lord Chamberlain

an't please your Grace Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter
the Viscount Rochford one of her highness' women

by heaven she is a dainty one Sweetheart
I were unmannerly to take you out
and not to kiss you A health gentlemen
let it go round

sir Thomas Lovell is the banquest ready
i' the privy chamber

yes my lord

your Grace
I fear with dancing is a little heated

I fear too much

in the next chamber

lead in your ladies every one Sweet partner
I must not yet forsake you Let's be merry
good my Lord Cardinal I have half a dozen healths
to drink to these fair ladies and a measure
to lead em once again and then let's dream
who's best in favour Let the music knock it


whither away so fast

O God save ye
e'en to the hall to hear what shall become
of the great Duke of Buckingham

I'll save you
that labour sir All's now done but the ceremony
of bringing back the prisoner
were you there

yes indeed was I

pray speak what has happen'd

you may guess quickly what

is he found guilty

yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't

I am sorry for t

so are a number more

but pray how pass'd it

I'll tell you in a little The great duke
he pleaded still not guilty and alleg'd
many sharp reasons to defeat the law
the king's attorney on the contrary
urg'd on the examinations proofs confessions
of divers witnesses which the duke desir'd
to have brought viv voce to his face
at which appear'd against him his surveyor
sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Car
confessor to him with that devil-monk
Hopkins that made this mischief

that was he
that fed him with his prophecies

the same
all these accus'd him strongly which he fain
would have flung from him but indeed he could not
and so his peers upon this evidence
have found him guilty of high treason Much
was either pitied in him or forgotten

after all this how did he bear himself

when he was brought again to the bar to hear
his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd
with such an agony he sweat extremely
and something spoke in choler ill and hasty
but he fell to himself again and sweetly
in all the rest show'd a most noble patience

I do not think he fears death

sure he does not
he never was so womanish the cause
he may a little grieve at

certainly
the cardinal is the end of this
'Tis likely
by all conjectures first Kildare's attainder
then deputy of Ireland who remov'd
Earl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too
lest he should help his father

that trick of state
was a deep envious one

at his return
no doubt he will requite it This is noted
and generally whoever the king favours
the cardinal instantly will find employment
and far enough from court too

all the commons
hate him perniciously and o' my conscience
wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
they love and dote on call him bounteous Buckingham

stay there sir
and see the noble ruin'd man you speak of

let's stand close and behold him

all good people
you that thus far have come to pity me
hear what I say and then go home and lose me
I have this day receiv'd a traitor's judgment
and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
and if I have a conscience let it sink me
even as the axe falls if I be not faithful
the law I bear no malice for my death
'T has done upon the premises but justice
but those that sought it I could wish more Christians
be what they will I heartily forgive em
yet let em look they glory not in mischief
nor build their evils on the graves of great men
for further life in this world I ne'er hope
nor will I sue although the king have mercies
more than I dare make faults You few that lov'd me
and dare be bold to weep for Buckingham
his noble friends and fellows whom to leave
is only bitter to him only dying
go with me like good angels to my end
and as the long divorce of steel falls on me
make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
and lift my soul to heaven Lead on o' God's name

I do beseech your Grace for charity
if ever any malice in your heart
were hid against me now to forgive me frankly

sir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you
as I would be forgiven I forgive all
there cannot be those numberless offences
'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with no black envy
and if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him
you met him half in heaven My vows and prayers
yet are the king's and till my soul forsake
shall cry for blessings on him may he live
longer than I have time to tell his years
ever belov'd and loving may his rule be
and when old time shall lead him to his end
goodness and he fill up one monument

to the water side I must conduct your Grace
then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux
who undertakes you to your end

prepare there
the duke is coming see the barge be ready
and fit it with such furniture as suits
the greatness of his person

nay Sir Nicholas
when I came hither I was Lord High Constable
and Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun
yet I am richer than my base accusers
that never knew what truth meant I now seal it
and with that blood will make them one day groan for't
my noble father Henry of Buckingham
who first rais'd head against usurping Richard
flying for succour to his servant Banister
being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd
and without trial fell God's peace be with him
Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying
my father's loss like a most royal prince
restor'd me to my honours and out of ruins
made my name once more noble Now his son
Henry the Eighth life honour name and all
that made me happy at one stroke has taken
for ever from the world I had my trial
and must needs say a noble one which makes me
a little happier than my wretched father
fell by our servants by those men welov'd most
a most unnatural and faithless service
heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
this from a dying man receive as certain
where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
and give your hearts to when they once perceive
the least rub in your fortunes fall away
like water from ye never found again
but where they mean to sink ye All good people
pray for me I must now forsake ye the last hour
of my long weary life is come upon me
farewell
and when you would say something that is sad
speak how I fell I have done and God forgive me


O this is full of pity Sir it calls
I fear too many curses on their heads

if the duke be guiltless
'Tis full of woe yet I can give you inkling
of an ensuing evil if it fall
greater than this

good angels keep it from us
what may it be You do not doubt my faith sir

this secret is so weighty twill require
a strong faith to conceal it

let me have it
I do not talk much

I am confident
you shall sir Did you not of late days hear
a buzzing of a separation
between the king and Katharine
yes but it held not
for when the king once heard it out of anger
he sent command to the lord mayor straight
to stop the rumour and allay those tongues
that durst disperse it

but that slander sir
is found a truth now for it grows again
fresher than e'er it was and held for certain
the king will venture at it Either the cardinal
or some about him near have out of malice
to the good queen possess'd him with a scruple
that will undo her to confirm this too
cardinal Campeius is arriv'd and lately
as all think for this business

'Tis the cardinal
and merely to revenge him on the emperor
for not bestowing on him at his asking

I think you have hit the mark but is't not cruel
that she should feel the smart of this The cardinal
will have his will and she must fall

'Tis woeful
we are too open here to argue this
let's think in private more


my lord The horses your lordship sent for with all the care I had I saw well chosen ridden and furnished They were young and handsome and of the best breed in the north When they were ready to set out for London a man of my Lord Cardinal's by commission and main power took them from me with this reason His master would be served before a subject if not before the king which stopped our mouths sir
I fear he will indeed Well let him have them
he will have all I think


well met my Lord Chamberlain

good day to both your Graces


I left him private
full of sad thoughts and troubles

what's the cause

it seems the marriage with his brother's wife
has crept too near his conscience

no his conscience
has crept too near another lady

'Tis so
this is the cardinal's doing the king-cardinal
that blind priest like the eldest son of Fortune
turns what he list The king will know him one day

pray God he do he'll never know himself else

and with what zeal for now he has crack'd the league
between us and the emperor the queen's great nephew
he dives into the king's soul and there scatters
dangers doubts wringing of the conscience
fears and despairs and all these for his marriage
and out of all these to restore the king
he counsels a divorce a loss of her
that like a jewel has hung twenty years
about his neck yet never lost her lustre
of her that loves him with that excellence
that angels love good men with even of her
that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls
will bless the king and is not this course pious

heaven keep me from such counsel Tis most true
these news are every where every tongue speaks em
and every true heart weeps for't All that dare
look into these affairs see this main end
the French king's sister Heaven will one day open
this bold bad man

and free us from his slavery

we had need pray
and heartily for our deliverance
or this imperious man will work us all
from princes into pages All men's honours
lie like one lump before him to be fashion'd
into what pitch he please

for me my lords
I love him not nor fear him there's my creed
as I am made without him so I'll stand
if the king please his curses and his blessings
touch me alike they're breath I not believe in
I knew him and I know him so I leave him
to him that made him proud the pope

and with some other business put the king
from these sad thoughts that work too much upon him
my lord you'll bear us company

excuse me
the king hath sent me otherwhere besides
you'll find a most unfit time to disturb him
health to your lordships

thanks my good Lord Chamberlain

how sad he looks sure he is much afflicted

who is there ha

pray God he be not angry

who's there I say How dare you thrust yourselves
into my private meditations

a gracious king that pardons all offences
malice ne'er meant our breach of duty this way
is business of estate in which we come
to know your royal pleasure

ye are too bold
go to I'll make ye know your times of business
is this an hour for temporal affairs ha


who's there my good Lord Cardinal O my Wolsey
the quiet of my wounded conscience
thou art a cure fit for a king

you're welcome
most learned reverend sir into our kingdom
use us and it


I be not found a talker

sir you cannot
I would your Grace would give us but an hour
of private conference

we are busy go

this priest has no pride in him

not to speak of
I would not be so sick though for his place
but this cannot continue

if it do
I'll venture one have-at-him

I another

your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom
above all princes in committing freely
your scruple to the voice of Christendom
who can be angry now what envy reach you
the Spaniard tied by blood and favour to her
must now confess if they have any goodness
the trial just and noble All the clerks
I mean the learned ones in Christian kingdoms
have their free voices Rome the nurse of judgment
invited by your noble self hath sent
one general tongue unto us this good man
this just and learned priest Cardinal Campeius
whom once more I present unto your highness

and once more in my arms I bid him welcome
and thank the holy conclave for their loves
they have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for

you are so noble To your highness' hand
I tender my commission by whose virtue
the court of Rome commanding you my Lord
cardinal of York are join'd with me their servant
in the impartial judging of this business

two equal men The queen shall be acquainted
forthwith for what you come Where's Gardiner

I know your majesty has always lov'd her
so dear in heart not to deny her that
a woman of less place might ask by law
scholars allow'd freely to argue for her

ay and the best she shall have and my favour
to him that does best God forbid else Cardinal
prithee call Gardiner to me my new secretary
I find him a fit fellow

you are the king's now

but to be commanded
for ever by your Grace whose hand has rais'd me

come hither Gardiner


my Lord of York was not one Doctor Pace
in this man's place before him

yes he was

was he not held a learned man

yes surely

believe me there's an ill opinion spread then
even of yourself Lord Cardinal
how of me

they will not stick to say you envied him
and fearing he would rise he was so virtuous
kept him a foreign man still which so griev'd him
that he ran mad and died

heaven's peace be with him
that's Christian care enough for living murmurers
there's places of rebuke He was a fool
for he would needs be virtuous that good fellow
if I command him follows my appointment
I will have none so near else Learn this brother
we live not to be grip'd by meaner persons

deliver this with modesty to the queen

the most convenient place that I can think of
for such receipt of learning is Black-Friars
my Wolsey see it furnish'd O my lord
would it not grieve an able man to leave
so sweet a bedfellow But conscience conscience
O tis a tender place and I must leave her


not for that neither here's the pang that pinches
his highness having liv'd so long with her and she
so good a lady that no tongue could ever
pronounce dishonour of her by my life
she never knew harm-doing O now after
so many courses of the sun enthron'd
still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
to leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
'Tis sweet at first to acquire after this process
to give her the avaunt it is a pity
would move a monster

hearts of most hard temper

O God's will much better
she ne'er had known pomp though t be temporal
yet if that quarrel Fortune do divorce
it from the bearer tis a sufferance panging
as soul and body's severing

alas poor lady
she's a stranger now again

so much the more
must pity drop upon her Verily
I swear tis better to be lowly born
and range with humble livers in content
than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief
and wear a golden sorrow

our content
is our best having
by my troth and maidenhead
I would not be a queen

beshrew me I would
and venture maidenhead for't and so would you
for all this spice of your hypocrisy
you that have so fair parts of woman on you
have too a woman's heart which ever yet
affected eminence wealth sovereignty
which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts
saving your mincing the capacity
of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
if you might please to stretch it

nay good troth

yes troth and troth you would not be a queen

no not for all the riches under heaven
'Tis strange a three-pence bow'd would hire me
old as I am to queen it But I pray you
what think you of a duchess have you limbs
to bear that load of title

no in truth

then you are weakly made Pluck off a little
I would not be a young count in your way
for more than blushing comes to if your back
cannot vouchsafe this burden tis too weak
ever to get a boy

how you do talk
I swear again I would not be a queen
for all the world

in faith for little England
you'd venture an emballing I myself
no more to the crown but that Lo who comes here


good morrow ladies What were't worth to know
the secret of your conference

my good lord
not your demand it values not your asking
our mistress' sorrows we were pitying

it was a gentle business and becoming
the action of good women there is hope
all will be well

now I pray God amen

you bear a gentle mind and heavenly blessings
follow such creatures That you may fair lady
perceive I speak sincerely and high note's
commends his good opinion of you and
does purpose honour to you no less flowing
than Marchioness of Pembroke to which title
a thousand pound a year annual support
out of his grace he adds

I do not know
what kind of my obedience I should tender
more than my all is nothing nor my prayers
are not words duly hallow'd nor my wishes
more worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes
are all I can return Beseech your lordship
vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience
as from a blushing handmaid to his highness
whose health and royalty I pray for

lady
I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
the king hath of you
I have perus'd her well
beauty and honour in her are so mingled
that they have caught the king and who knows yet
but from this lady may proceed a gem
to lighten all this isle

I'll to the king
and say I spoke with you

my honour'd lord


why this it is see see
I have been begging sixteen years in court
am yet a courtier beggarly nor could
come pat betwixt too early and too late
for any suit of pounds and you O fate
a very fresh-fish here fie fie upon
this compell'd fortune have your mouth fill'd up

this is strange to me

how tastes it is it bitter forty pence no
there was a lady once tis an old story
that would not be a queen that would she not
for all the mud in Egypt have you heard it

come you are pleasant

with your theme I could
o'ermount the lark The Marchioness of Pembroke
a thousand pounds a year for pure respect
no other obligation By my life
that promises more thousands honour's train
is longer than his foreskirt By this time
I know your back will bear a duchess say
are you not stronger than you were

make yourself mirth with your particular fancy
and leave me out on't Would I had no being
if this salute my blood a jot it faints me
to think what follows
the queen is comfortless and we forgetful
in our long absence Pray do not deliver
what here you've heard to her

what do you think me


whilst our commission from Rome is read
let silence be commanded

what's the need
it hath already publicly been read
and on all sides the authority allow'd
you may then spare that time


say Henry King of England come into the court

Henry King of England come into the court

Katharine Queen of England come into the court

sir I desire you do me right and justice
and to bestow your pity on me for
I am a most poor woman and a stranger
born out of your dominions having here
no judge indifferent nor no more assurance
of equal friendship and proceeding Alas sir
in what have I offended you what cause
hath my behaviour given to your displeasure
and take your good grace from me Heaven witness
I have been to you a true and humble wife
at all times to your will conformable
ever in fear to kindle your dislike
yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry
as I saw it inclin'd When was the hour
I ever contradicted your desire
or made it not mine too Or which of your friends
have I not strove to love although I knew
he were mine enemy what friend of mine
that had to him deriv'd your anger did I
continue in my liking nay gave notice
he was from thence discharg'd Sir call to mind
that I have been your wife in this obedience
upward of twenty years and have been blest
with many children by you if in the course
and process of this time you can report
and prove it too against mine honour aught
my bond to wedlock or my love and duty
turn me away and let the foul'st contempt
shut door upon me and so give me up
to the sharp'st kind of justice Please you sir
the king your father was reputed for
a prince most prudent of an excellent
and unmatch'd wit and judgment Ferdinand
my father King of Spain was reckon'd one
the wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
a year before it is not to be question'd
that they had gather'd a wise council to them
of every realm that did debate this business
who deem'd our marriage lawful Wherefore I humbly
beseech you sir to spare me till I may
be by my friends in Spain advis'd whose counsel
I will implore if not i' the name of God
your pleasure be fulfill'd

you have here lady
and of your choice these reverend fathers men
yea the elect o' the land who are assembled
to plead your cause It shall be therefore bootless
that longer you desire the court as well
for your own quiet as to rectify
what is unsettled in the king

his Grace
hath spoken well and justly therefore madam
it's fit this royal session do proceed
and that without delay their arguments
be now produc'd and heard

lord Cardinal
to you I speak

your pleasure madam

sir
I am about to weep but thinking that
the daughter of a king my drops of tears
I'll turn to sparks of fire

be patient yet

I will when you are humble nay before
or God will punish me I do believe
induc'd by potent circumstances that
you are mine enemy and make my challenge
you shall not be my judge for it is you
have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me
which God's dew quench Therefore I say again
I utterly abhor yea from my soul
refuse you for my judge whom yet once more
I hold my most malicious foe and think not
at all a friend to truth

I do profess
you speak not like yourself who ever yet
of disposition gentle and of wisdom
o'ertopping woman's power Madam you do me wrong
I have no spleen against you nor injustice
for you or any how far I have proceeded
or how far further shall is warranted
by a commission from the consistory
yea the whole consistory of Rome You charge me
that I have blown this coal I do deny it
the king is present if it be known to him
that I gainsay my deed how may he wound
and worthily my falsehood yea as much
as you have done my truth If he know
that I am free of your report he knows
I am not of your wrong Therefore in him
it lies to cure me and the cure is to
remove these thoughts from you the which before
his highness shall speak in I do beseech
you gracious madam to unthink your speaking
and to say so no more
my lord my lord
I am a simple woman much too weak
to oppose your cunning You're meek and humble-mouth'd
you sign your place and calling in full seeming
with meekness and humility but your heart
is cramm'd with arrogancy spleen and pride
you have by fortune and his highness' favours
gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
where powers are your retainers and your words
domestics to you serve your will as't please
yourself pronounce their office I must tell you
you tender more your person's honour than
your high profession spiritual that again
I do refuse you for my judge and here
before you all appeal unto the pope
to bring my whole cause fore his holiness
and to be judg'd by him


stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and
disdainful to be tried by't tis not well
she's going away

call her again

Katharine Queen of England come into the court

madam you are call'd back

what need you note it pray you keep your way
when you are call'd return Now the Lord help
they vex me past my patience Pray you pass on
I will not tarry no nor ever more
upon this business my appearance make
in any of their courts


go thy ways Kate
a better wife let him in nought be trusted
for speaking false in that thou art alone
if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
thy meekness saint-like wife-like government
obeying in commanding and thy parts
sovereign and pious else could speak thee out
the queen of earthly queens She's noble born
and like her true nobility she has
carried herself towards me

most gracious sir
in humblest manner I require your highness
that it shall please you to declare in hearing
of all these ears for where I am robb'd and bound
there must I be unloos'd although not there
at once and fully satisfied whether ever I
did broach this business to your highness or
laid any scruple in your way which might
induce you to the question on't or ever
a royal lady spake one the least word that might
be to the prejudice of her present state
or touch of her good person

my Lord Cardinal
I do excuse you yea upon mine honour
I free you from't You are not to be taught
that you have many enemies that know not
why they are so but like to village curs
bark when their fellows do by some of these
the queen is put in anger You're excus'd
but will you be more justified you ever
have wish'd the sleeping of this business never
desir'd it to be stirr'd but oft have hinder'd oft
the passages made toward it On my honour
I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point
and thus far clear him Now what mov'd me to't
I will be bold with time and your attention
then mark the inducement Thus it came give heed to't
scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd
by the Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador
who had been hither sent on the debating
a marriage twixt the Duke of Orleans and
our daughter Mary I' the progress of this business
ere a determinate resolution he
I mean the bishop did require a respite
wherein he might the king his lord advertise
whether our daughter were legitimate
respecting this our marriage with the dowager
sometimes our brother's wife This respite shook
the bosom of my conscience enter'd me
yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
the region of my breast which forc'd such way
that many maz'd considerings did throng
and press'd in with this caution First methought
I stood not in the smile of heaven who had
commanded nature that my lady's womb
if it conceiv'd a male child by me should
the grave does to the dead for her male issue
or died where they were made or shortly after
this world had air'd them Hence I took a thought
this was a judgment on me that my kingdom
well worthy the best heir o' the world should not
be gladded in't by me Then follows that
I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
by this my issue's fail and that gave to me
many a groaning throe Thus hulling in
the wild sea of my conscience I did steer
toward this remedy whereupon we are
now present here together that's to say
I meant to rectify my conscience which
I then did feel full sick and yet not well
by all the rev'rend fathers of the land
and doctors learn'd First I began in private
with you my Lord of Lincoln you remember
how under my oppression I did reek
when I first mov'd you
very well my liege

I have spoke long be pleas'd yourself to say
how far you satisfied me

so please your highness
the question did at first so stagger me
bearing a state of mighty moment in't
and consequence of dread that I committed
the daring'st counsel that I had to doubt
and did entreat your highness to this course
which you are running here

then I mov'd you
my Lord of Canterbury and got your leave
to make this present summons Unsolicited
I left no reverend person in this court
but by particular consent proceeded
under your hands and seals therefore go on
of the good queen but the sharp thorny points
of my alleged reasons drive this forward
prove but our marriage lawful by my life
and kingly dignity we are contented
to wear our mortal state to come with her
Katharine our queen before the primest creature
that's paragon'd o' the world

so please your highness
the queen being absent tis a needful fitness
that we adjourn this court till further day
mean while must be an earnest motion
made to the queen to call back her appeal
she intends unto his holiness


I may perceive
these cardinals trifle with me I abhor
this dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome
prithee return with thy approach I know
my comfort comes along Break up the court
I say set on


take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles
sing and disperse em if thou canst Leave working

Orpheus with his lute made trees
and the mountain tops that freeze
bow themselves when he did sing
to his music plants and flowers
ever sprung as sun and showers
there had made a lasting spring
every thing that heard him play
even the billows of the sea
hung their heads and then lay by
in sweet music is such art
killing care and grief of heart


how now

an't please your Grace the two great cardinals
wait in the presence

would they speak with me

they will'd me say so madam

pray their Graces
to come near

what can be their business
with me a poor weak woman fall'n from favour
I do not like their coming now I think on't
they should be good men their affairs as righteous
but all hoods make not monks

peace to your highness

your Graces find me here part of a housewife
I would be all against the worst may happen
what are your pleasures with me reverend lords

may it please you noble madam to withdraw
into your private chamber we shall give you
the full cause of our coming

speak it here
there's nothing I have done yet o' my conscience
deserves a corner would all other women
could speak this with as free a soul as I do
my lords I care not so much I am happy
above a number if my actions
were tried by every tongue every eye saw em
envy and base opinion set against em
seek me out and that way I am wife in
out with it boldly truth loves open dealing

tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina serenissima

O good my lord no Latin
I am not such a truant since my coming
as not to know the language I have liv'd in
a strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious
pray speak in English here are some will thank you
if you speak truth for their poor mistress' sake
believe me she has had much wrong Lord Cardinal
the willing'st sin I ever yet committed
may be absolv'd in English

noble lady
I am sorry my integrity should breed
and service to his majesty and you
so deep suspicion where all faith was meant
to taint that honour every good tongue blesses
nor to betray you any way to sorrow
you have too much good lady but to know
how you stand minded in the weighty difference
between the king and you and to deliver
like free and honest men our just opinions
and comforts to your cause

most honour'd madam
my Lord of York out of his noble nature
zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace
forgetting like a good man your late censure
both of his truth and him which was too far
offers as I do in sign of peace
his service and his counsel

to betray me
my lords I thank you both for your good wills
ye speak like honest men pray God ye prove so
in such a point of weight so near mine honour
more near my life I fear with my weak wit
and to such men of gravity and learning
in truth I know not I was set at work
among my maids full little God knows looking
either for such men or such business
for her sake that I have been for I feel
the last fit of my greatness good your Graces
let me have time and counsel for my cause
alas I am a woman friendless hopeless

madam you wrong the king's love with these fears
your hopes and friends are infinite

in England
but little for my profit Can you think lords
that any Englishman dare give me counsel
or be a known friend gainst his highness' pleasure
though he be grown so desperate to be honest
they that must weigh out my afflictions
they that my trust must grow to live not here
they are as all my other comforts far hence
in mine own country lords

I would your Grace
would leave your griefs and take my counsel

how sir

put your main cause into the king's protection
he's loving and most gracious twill be much
both for your honour better and your cause
for if the trial of the law o'ertake ye
you'll part away disgrac'd

he tells you rightly

ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruin
heaven is above all yet there sits a judge
that no king can corrupt

your rage mistakes us

the more shame for ye holy men I thought ye
upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
but cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye
mend em for shame my lords Is this your comfort
the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
a woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd
I will not wish ye half my miseries
I have more charity but say I warn'd ye
take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once
the burden of my sorrows fall upon ye

madam this is a mere distraction
you turn the good we offer into envy

and all such false professors Would ye have me
if ye have any justice any pity
if ye be anything but churchmen's habits
put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
alas he has banish'd me his bed already
his love too long ago I am old my lords
and all the fellowship I hold now with him
is only my obedience What can happen
to me above this wretchedness all your studies
make me a curse like this

your fears are worse

have I liv'd thus long let me speak myself
since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one
a woman I dare say without vain-glory
never yet branded with suspicion
have I with all my full affections
still met the king lov'd him next heaven obey'd him
almost forgot my prayers to content him
and am I thus rewarded tis not well lords
bring me a constant woman to her husband
one that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure
and to that woman when she has done most
yet will I add an honour a great patience

madam you wander from the good we aim at

my lord I dare not make myself so guilty
to give up willingly that noble title
your master wed me to nothing but death
shall e'er divorce my dignities

pray hear me

would I had never trod this English earth
or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
ye have angels' faces but heaven knows your hearts
I am the most unhappy woman living


alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes
shipwrack'd upon a kingdom where no pity
no friends no hope no kindred weep for me
almost no grave allow'd me Like the lily
that once was mistress of the field and flourish'd
I'll hang my head and perish

if your Grace
could but be brought to know our ends are honest
you'd feel more comfort Why should we good lady
upon what cause wrong you alas our places
the way of our profession is against it
we are to cure such sorrows not to sow them
for goodness' sake consider what you do
how you may hurt yourself ay utterly
grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage
so much they love it but to stubborn spirits
they swell and grow as terrible as storms
I know you have a gentle noble temper
a soul as even as a calm pray think us
those we profess peace-makers friends and servants

madam you'll find it so You wrong your virtues
with these weak women's fears a noble spirit
as yours was put into you ever casts
such doubts as false coin from it The king loves you
beware you lose it not for us if you please
to trust us in your business we are ready
to use our utmost studies in your service

do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me
if I have us'd myself unmannerly
you know I am a woman lacking wit
to make a seemly answer to such persons
pray do my service to his majesty
while I shall have my life Come reverend fathers
bestow your counsels on me she now begs
that little thought when she set footing here
she should have bought her dignities so dear


if you will now unite in your complaints
and force them with a constancy the cardinal
cannot stand under them if you omit
the offer of this time I cannot promise
but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces
with these you bear already

I am joyful
to meet the least occasion that may give me
remembrance of my father-in-law the duke
to be reveng'd on him

which of the peers
strangely neglected when did he regard
the stamp of nobleness in any person
out of himself

my lords you speak your pleasures
what he deserves of you and me I know
what we can do to him though now the time
gives way to us I much fear If you cannot
bar his access to the king never attempt
any thing on him for he hath a witchcraft
over the king in's tongue

O fear him not
his spell in that is out the king hath found
matter against him that for ever mars
the honey of his language No he's settled
not to come off in his displeasure

sir
once every hour

believe it this is true
in the divorce his contrary proceedings
are all unfolded wherein he appears
as I would wish mine enemy

how came
his practices to light

most strangely

O how how

the cardinal's letter to the pope miscarried
and came to the eye o' the king wherein was read
that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
to stay the judgment o' the divorce for if
it did take place I do quoth he perceive
a creature of the queen's Lady Anne Bullen

has the king this

believe it

will this work

the king in this perceives him how he coasts
and hedges his own way But in this point
all his tricks founder and he brings his physic
after his patient's death the king already
hath married the fair lady

would he had

may you be happy in your wish my lord
for I profess you have it

trace the conjunction

my amen to't

all men's

there's order given for her coronation
marry this is yet but young and may be left
to some ears unrecounted But my lords
she is a gallant creature and complete
in mind and feature I persuade me from her
will fall some blessing to this land which shall
in it be memoriz'd

but will the king
digest this letter of the cardinal's
the Lord forbid

marry amen
no no
there be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
will make this sting the sooner Cardinal Campeius
is stol'n away to Rome hath ta'en no leave
has left the cause o' the king unhandled and
is posted as the agent of our cardinal
to second all his plot I do assure you
the king cried Ha at this

now God incense him
and let him cry Ha louder

but my lord
when returns Cranmer

he is return'd in his opinions which
have satisfied the king for his divorce
together with all famous colleges
almost in Christendom Shortly I believe
her coronation Katharine no more
shall be call'd queen but princess dowager
and widow to Prince Arthur

this same Cranmer's
a worthy fellow and hath ta'en much pain
in the king's business

he has and we shall see him
for it an archbishop

so I hear

'Tis so
the cardinal


observe observe he's moody

gave't you the king

to his own hand in his bedchamber

look'd he o' the inside of the paper

presently
he did unseal them and the first he view'd
he did it with a serious mind a heed
was in his countenance You he bade
attend him here this morning

is he ready
to come abroad

I think by this he is

leave me awhile

the French King's sister he shall marry her
Anne Bullen No I'll no Anne Bullens for him
there's more in't than fair visage Bullen
no we'll no Bullens Speedily I wish
to hear from Rome The Marchioness of Pembroke

he's discontented

may be he hears the king
does whet his anger to him

sharp enough
lord for thy justice

the late queen's gentlewoman a knight's daughter
to be her mistress' mistress the queen's queen
this candle burns not clear tis I must snuff it
then out it goes What though I know her virtuous
and well deserving yet I know her for
our cause that she should lie i' the bosom of
our hard-rul'd king Again there is sprung up
a heretic an arch one Cranmer one
hath crawl'd into the favour of the king
and is his oracle

he is vex'd at something

I would twere something that would fret the string
the master-cord on's heart


the king the king

what piles of wealth hath he accumulated
to his own portion and what expense by the hour
seems to flow from him How i' the name of thrift
does he rake this together Now my lords
saw you the cardinal
my lord we have
stood here observing him some strange commotion
is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
then lays his finger on his temple straight
springs out into fast gait then stops again
strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
his eye against the moon in most strange postures
we have seen him set himself

it may well be
there is a mutiny in s mind This morning
papers of state he sent me to peruse
as I requir'd and wot you what I found
there on my conscience put unwittingly
forsooth an inventory thus importing
the several parcels of his plate his treasure
rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
I find at such a proud rate that it out-speaks

it's heaven's will
some spirit put this paper in the packet
to bless your eye withal

if we did think
his contemplation were above the earth
and fix'd on spiritual object he should still
dwell in his musings but I am afraid
his thinkings are below the moon not worth
his serious considering


heaven forgive me
ever God bless your highness

good my lord
you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
of your best graces in your mind the which
to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
to keep your earthly audit sure in that
I deem you an ill husband and am glad
to have you therein my companion

sir
for holy offices I have a time a time
to think upon the part of business which
I bear i' the state and nature does require
her times of preservation which perforce
I her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
must give my tendance to

you have said well

and ever may your highness yoke together
as I will lend you cause my doing well
with my well saying

and tis a kind of good deed to say well
and yet words are no deeds My father lov'd you
he said he did and with his deed did crown
his word upon you Since I had my office
I have kept you next my heart have not alone
employ'd you where high profits might come home
but par'd my present havings to bestow
my bounties upon you

what should this mean

the Lord increase this business

have I not made you
the prime man of the state I pray you tell me
if what I now pronounce you have found true
and if you may confess it say withal
if you are bound to us or no What say you

shower'd on me daily have been more than could
my studied purposes requite which went
beyond all man's endeavours my endeavours
have ever come too short of my desires
yet fil'd with my abilities Mine own ends
have been mine so that evermore they pointed
to the good of your most sacred person and
the profit of the state For your great graces
heap'd upon me poor undeserver I
can nothing render but allegiant thanks
my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty
which ever has and ever shall be growing
till death that winter kill it

fairly answer'd
a loyal and obedient subject is
therein illustrated the honour of it
does pay the act of it as i' the contrary
the foulness is the punishment I presume
my heart dropp'd love my power rain'd honour more
on you than any so your hand and heart
your brain and every function of your power
should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
as twere in love's particular be more
to me your friend than any

I do profess
that for your highness' good I ever labour'd
more than mine own that am have and will be
though all the world should crack their duty to you
and throw it from their soul though perils did
abound as thick as thought could make em and
appear in forms more horrid yet my duty
as doth a rock against the chiding flood
should the approach of this wild river break
and stand unshaken yours

'Tis nobly spoken
for you have seen him open't Read o'er this

and after this and then to breakfast with
what appetite you have


what should this mean
what sudden anger's this how have I reap'd it
he parted frowning from me as if ruin
leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him
then makes him nothing I must read this paper
I fear the story of his anger Tis so
this paper has undone me Tis the account
of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
and fee my friends in Rome O negligence
fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil
made me put this main secret in the packet
no new device to beat this from his brains
I know twill stir him strongly yet I know
a way if it take right in spite of fortune
will bring me off again What's this To the Pope
the letter as I live with all the business
I writ to's holiness Nay then farewell
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness
and from that full meridian of my glory
I haste now to my setting I shall fall
like a bright exhalation in the evening
and no man see me more


hear the king's pleasure cardinal who commands you
to render up the great seal presently
into our hands and to confine yourself
to Asher-house my Lord of Winchester's
till you hear further from his highness

where's your commission lord words cannot carry
authority so weighty

who dare cross em
bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly

till I find more than will or words to do it
I mean your malice know officious lords
I dare and must deny it Now I feel
of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy
how eagerly ye follow my disgraces
as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
follow your envious courses men of malice
you have Christian warrant for em and no doubt
in time will find their fit rewards That seal
you ask with such a violence the king
mine and your master with his own hand gave me
bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
tied it by letters-patents now who'll take it

the king that gave it

it must be himself then

thou art a proud traitor priest

proud lord thou liest
within these forty hours Surrey durst better
have burnt that tongue than said so

thy ambition
thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land
of noble Buckingham my father-in-law
the heads of all thy brother cardinals
with thee and all thy best parts bound together
weigh'd not a hair of his Plague of your policy
you sent me deputy for Ireland
that might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him
whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
absolv'd him with an axe

this and all else
this talking lord can lay upon my credit
I answer is most false The duke by law
found his deserts how innocent I was
from any private malice in his end
his noble jury and foul cause can witness
if I lov'd many words lord I should tell you
you have as little honesty as honour
that in the way of loyalty and truth
toward the king my ever royal master
dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be
and all that love his follies

by my soul
your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel
can ye endure to hear this arrogance
and from this fellow If we live thus tamely
to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
farewell nobility let his Grace go forward
and dare us with his cap like larks

all goodness
is poison to thy stomach

yes that goodness
of gleaning all the land's wealth into one
into your own hands cardinal by extortion
the goodness of your intercepted packets
you writ to the pope against the king your goodness
since you provoke me shall be most notorious
my Lord of Norfolk as you are truly noble
as you respect the common good the state
of our despis'd nobility our issues
who if he live will scarce be gentlemen
collected from his life I'll startle you
worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench
lay kissing in your arms Lord Cardinal

how much methinks I could despise this man
but that I am bound in charity against it

those articles my lord are in the king's hand
but thus much they are foul ones

so much fairer
and spotless shall mine innocence arise
when the king knows my truth

this cannot save you
I thank my memory I yet remember
some of these articles and out they shall
now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal
you'll show a little honesty
speak on sir
I dare your worst objections if I blush
it is to see a nobleman want manners

I had rather want those than my head Have at you
first that without the king's assent or know ledge
you wrought to be a legate by which power
you maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops

then that in all you writ to Rome or else
to foreign princes Ego et Rex meus
was still inscrib'd in which you brought the king
to be your servant

then that without the knowledge
either of king or council when you went
ambassador to the emperor you made bold
to carry into Flanders the great seal

to Gregory de Cassado to conclude
without the king's will or the state's allowance
a league between his highness and Ferrara

that out of mere ambition you have caus'd
your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin

then that you have sent innumerable substance
by what means got I leave to your own conscience
to furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
you have for dignities to the mere undoing
of all the kingdom Many more there are
which since they are of you and odious
I will not taint my mouth with

O my lord
press not a falling man too far tis virtue
his faults lie open to the laws let them
not you correct him My heart weeps to see him

I forgive him

lord Cardinal the king's further pleasure is
because all those things you have done of late
by your power legatine within this kingdom
fall into the compass of a pr munire
that therefore such a writ be su'd against you
to forfeit all your goods lands tenements
chattels and whatsoever and to be
out of the king's protection This is my charge

and so we'll leave you to your meditations
how to live better For your stubborn answer
about the giving back the great seal to us
the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
so fare you well my little good Lord Cardinal


farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
this is the state of man to-day be puts forth
the tender leaves of hopes to-morrow blossoms
and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
the third day comes a frost a killing frost
and when he thinks good easy man full surely
his greatness is a-ripening nips his root
and then he falls as I do I have ventur'd
like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
this many summers in a sea of glory
but far beyond my depth my high-blown pride
at length broke under me and now has left me
weary and old with service to the mercy
of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
vain pomp and glory of this world I hate yo
I feel my heart new open'd O how wretched
is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours
there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
and when he falls he falls like Lucifer
never to hope again

why how now Cromwell

I have no power to speak sir

what amaz'd
at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder
a great man should decline Nay an you weep
I am fall'n indeed

how does your Grace

why well
never so truly happy my good Cromwell
I know myself now and I feel within me
a peace above all earthly dignities
a still and quiet conscience The king has cur'd me
these ruin'd pillars out of pity taken
a load would sink a navy too much honour
O tis a burden Cromwell tis a burden
too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven

I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it

I hope I have I am able now methinks
out of a fortitude of soul I feel
to endure more miseries and greater far
than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer
what news abroad

the heaviest and the worst
is your displeasure with the king

God bless him

the next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen

that's somewhat sudden
but he's a learned man May he continue
long in his highness' favour and do justice
for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones
when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
may have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em
what more

that Cranmer is return'd with welcome
install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury

that's news indeed

last that the Lady Anne
whom the king hath in secrecy long married
this day was view'd in open as his queen
going to chapel and the voice is now
only about her coronation
there was the weight that pull'd me down O Cromwell
the king has gone beyond me all my glories
in that one woman I have lost for ever
no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
or gild again the noble troops that waited
upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell
I am a poor fall'n man unworthy now
to be thy lord and master seek the king
that sun I pray may never set I have told him
what and how true thou art he will advance thee
some little memory of me will stir him
I know his noble nature not to let
thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell
neglect him not make use now and provide
for thine own future safety

O my lord
must I then leave you must I needs forego
so good so noble and so true a master
with what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord
the king shall have my service but my prayers
for ever and for ever shall be yours

Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear
in all my miseries but thou hast forc'd me
out of thy honest truth to play the woman
let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell
and when I am forgotten as I shall be
and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
of me more must be heard of say I taught thee
say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
found thee a way out of his wrack to rise in
a sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it
mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me
Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition
by that sin fell the angels how can man then
the image of his Maker hope to win by't
corruption wins not more than honesty
still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
to silence envious tongues be just and fear not
let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's
thy God's and truth's then if thou fall'st O Cromwell
thou fall'st a blessed martyr Serve the king
and prithee lead me in
there take an inventory of all I have
to the last penny tis the king's my robe
and my integrity to heaven is all
I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell
had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal
I serv'd my king he would not in mine age
have left me naked to mine enemies

good sir have patience

so I have Farewell
the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell

you're well met once again

so are you

you come to take your stand here and behold
the Lady Anne pass from her coronation

'Tis all my business At our last encounter
the Duke of Buckingham came from his trial

'Tis very true but that time offer'd sorrow
this general joy

'Tis well the citizens
I am sure have shown at full their royal minds
as let em have their rights they are ever forward
in celebration of this day with shows
pageants and sights of honour
never greater
nor I'll assure you better taken sir

may I be bold to ask what that contains
that paper in your hand

yes tis the list
of those that claim their offices this day
by custom of the coronation
the Duke of Suffolk is the first and claims
to be high-steward next the Duke of Norfolk
he to be earl marshal you may read the rest

I thank you sir had I not known those customs
I should have been beholding to your paper
but I beseech you what's become of Katharine
the princess dowager how goes her business

that I can tell you too The Archbishop
learned and reverend fathers of his order
held a late court at Dunstable six miles off
from Ampthill where the princess lay to which
she was often cited by them but appear'd not
and to be short for not appearance and
the king's late scruple by the main assent
of all these learned men she was divorc'd
and the late marriage made of none effect
since which she was remov'd to Kimbolton
where she remains now sick

alas good lady

the trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming

a lively flourish of trumpets


1. Two Judges
3. Choristers singing


4. Mayor of London bearing the mace Then Garter in his coat of arms and on his head a gilt copper crown
5.

6.

7. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports under it the

8. The old
9. Certain Ladies or Countesses with plain circlets of gold without flowers
they pass over the stage in order and state


a royal train believe me These I know
who's that that bears the sceptre

marquess Dorset

a bold brave gentleman That should be
the Duke of Suffolk

'Tis the same high-steward

and that my Lord of Norfolk

yes

heaven bless thee
thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on
sir as I have a soul she is an angel
our king has all the Indies in his arms
and more and richer when he strains that lady
I cannot blame his conscience

they that bear
the cloth of honour over her are four barons

those men are happy and so are all are near her
I take it she that carries up the train
is that old noble lady Duchess of Norfolk

it is and all the rest are countesses

their coronets say so These are stars indeed
and sometimes falling ones

no more of that


God save you sir Where have you been broiling

among the crowd i' the Abbey where a finger
could not be wedg'd in more I am stifled
with the mere rankness of their joy

the ceremony

that I did

how was it

well worth the seeing

good sir speak it to us

as well as I am able The rich stream
of lords and ladies having brought the queen
to a prepar'd place in the choir fell off
a distance from her while her Grace sat down
to rest awhile some half an hour or so
in a rich chair of state opposing freely
the beauty of her person to the people
believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
that ever lay by man which when the people
as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks
doublets I think flew up and had their faces
been loose this day they had been lost Such joy
I never saw before Great-bellied women
that had not half a week to go like rams
in the old time of war would shake the press
and make em reel before them No man living
could say This is my wife there all were woven
so strangely in one piece

but what follow'd

at length her Grace rose and with modest paces
came to the altar where she kneel'd and saint-like
cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly
then rose again and bow'd her to the people
when by the Archbishop of Canterbury
she had all the royal makings of a queen
the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir
with all the choicest music of the kingdom
together sung Te Deum So she parted
and with the same full state pac'd back again
to York-place where the feast is held

sir
you must no more call it York-place that's past
for since the cardinal fell that title's lost
'Tis now the king's and call'd Whitehall

I know it
but tis so lately alter'd that the old name
is fresh about me

what two reverend bishops
were those that went on each side of the queen

newly preferr'd from the king's secretary
the other London

he of Winchester
is held no great good lover of the archbishop's
the virtuous Cranmer

all the land knows that
however yet there's no great breach when it comes
Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him

who may that be I pray you

Thomas Cromwell
a man in much esteem with the king and truly
a worthy friend The king
has made him master o' the jewel house
and one already of the privy-council


yes without all doubt
come gentlemen ye shall go my way which
is to the court and there ye shall be my guests
something I can command As I walk thither
I'll tell ye more

you may command us sir


how does your Grace

O Griffith sick to death
my legs like loaden branches bow to the earth
willing to leave their burden Reach a chair
so now methinks I feel a little ease
didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou ledd'st me
that the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey
was dead
yes madam but I think your Grace
out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't

prithee good Griffith tell me how he died
if well he stepp'd before me happily
for my example

well the voice goes madam
for after the stout Earl Northumberland
arrested him at York and brought him forward
as a man sorely tainted to his answer
he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
he could not sit his mule

alas poor man

at last with easy roads he came to Leicester
lodg'd in the abbey where the reverend abbot
with all his covent honourably receiv'd him
an old man broken with the storms of state
is come to lay his weary bones among ye
give him a little earth for charity
so went to bed where eagerly his sickness
pursu'd him still and three nights after this
about the hour of eight which he himself
foretold should be his last full of repentance
continual meditations tears and sorrows
he gave his honours to the world again
his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace

so may he rest his faults lie gently on him
yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him
and yet with charity He was a man
of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
himself with princes one that by suggestion
tied all the kingdom simony was fair-play
his own opinion was his law i' the presence
he would say untruths and be ever double
but where he meant to ruin pitiful
his promises were as he then was mighty
but his performance as he is now nothing
of his own body he was ill and gave
the clergy ill example

noble madam
men's evil manners live in brass their virtues
we write in water May it please your highness
to hear me speak his good now

yes good Griffith
I were malicious else

this cardinal
though from a humble stock undoubtedly
was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle
he was a scholar and a ripe and good one
exceeding wise fair-spoken and persuading
but to those men that sought him sweet as summer
and though he were unsatisfied in getting
which was a sin yet in bestowing madam
he was most princely Ever witness for him
those twins of learning that he rais'd in you
Ipswich and Oxford one of which fell with him
unwilling to outlive the good that did it
the other though unfinish'd yet so famous
so excellent in art and still so rising
that Christendom shall ever speak his virtue
his overthrow heap'd happiness upon him
for then and not till then he felt himself
and found the blessedness of being little
and to add greater honours to his age
than man could give him he died fearing God

after my death I wish no other herald
no other speaker of my living actions
to keep mine honour from corruption
whom I most hated living thou hast made me
with thy religious truth and modesty
now in his ashes honour Peace be with him
patience be near me still and set me lower
I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith
cause the musicians play me that sad note
I nam'd my knell whilst I sit meditating
on that celestial harmony I go to


she is asleep good wench let's sit down quiet
for fear we wake her softly gentle Patience


spirits of peace where are ye Are ye all gone
and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye

madam we are here

saw ye none enter since I slept

none madam

no Saw you not even now a blessed troop
invite me to a banquet whose bright faces
cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
they promis'd me eternal happiness
and brought me garlands Griffith which I feel
I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly

I am most joyful madam such good dreams
possess your fancy

bid the music leave
they are harsh and heavy to me


do you note
how long her face is drawn How pale she looks
and of an earthy cold Mark her eyes

she is going wench Pray pray

heaven comfort her


an't like your Grace

you are a saucy fellow
deserve we no more reverence

you are to blame
knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness
to use so rude behaviour go to kneel

I humbly do entreat your highness pardon
my haste made me unmannerly There is staying

admit him entrance Griffith but this fellow
let me ne'er see again

if my sight fail not
you should be lord ambassador from the emperor

my royal nephew and your name Capucius

madam the same your servant

O my lord
the times and titles now are alter'd strangely
with me since first you knew me But I pray you
what is your pleasure with me

noble lady
first mine own service to your Grace the next
the king's request that I would visit you
sends you his princely commendations
and heartily entreats you take good comfort

O my good lord that comfort comes too late
'Tis like a pardon after execution
that gentle physic given in time had cur'd me
but now I am past all comforts here but prayers
how does his highness

madam in good health

so may he ever do and ever flourish
when I shall dwell with worms and my poor name
banish'd the kingdom Patience is that letter
I caus'd you write yet sent away

no madam


this to my lord the king

most willing madam

in which I have commended to his goodness
the model of our chaste loves his young daughter
the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her
beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding
she is young and of a noble modest nature
I hope she will deserve well and a little
to love her for her mother's sake that lov'd him
heaven knows how dearly My next poor petition
is that his noble Grace would have some pity
upon my wretched women that so long
have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully
of which there is not one I dare avow
and now I should not lie but will deserve
for virtue and true beauty of the soul
for honesty and decent carriage
and sure those men are happy that shall have em
the last is for my men they are the poorest
but poverty could never draw em from me
that they may have their wages duly paid em
and something over to remember me by
if heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life
and able means we had not parted thus
these are the whole contents and good my lord
by that you love the dearest in this world
as you wish Christian peace to souls departed
stand these poor people's friend and urge the king
to do me this last right

by heaven I will
or let me lose the fashion of a man

I thank you honest lord Remember me
in all humility unto his highness
say his long trouble now is passing
for so I will Mine eyes grow dim Farewell
my lord Griffith farewell Nay Patience
you must not leave me yet I must to bed
call in more women When I am dead good wench
let me be us'd with honour strew me over
with maiden flowers that all the world may know
I was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me
then lay me forth although unqueen'd yet like
a queen and daughter to a king inter me
I can no more


it's one o'clock boy is't not

it hath struck

these should be hours for necessities
not for delights times to repair our nature
with comforting repose and not for us
whither so late

came you from the king my lord

I did Sir Thomas and left him at primero
with the Duke of Suffolk

I must to him too
before he go to bed I'll take my leave

not yet Sir Thomas Lovell What s the matter
it seems you are in haste an if there be
no great offence belongs to't give your friend
some touch of your late business affairs that walk
as they say spirits do at midnight have
in them a wilder nature than the business
that seeks dispatch by day

my lord I love you
much weightier than this work The queen's in labour
they say in great extremity and fear'd
she'll with the labour end

the fruit she goes with
I pray for heartily that it may find
good time and live but for the stock Sir Thomas
I wish it grubb'd up now

methinks I could
cry the amen and yet my conscience says
she's a good creature and sweet lady does
deserve our better wishes

but sir sir
hear me Sir Thomas you're a gentleman
of mine own way I know you wise religious
and let me tell you it will ne'er be well
'Twill not Sir Thomas Lovell take t of me
sleep in their graves

now sir you speak of two
the most remark'd i' the kingdom As for Cromwell
beside that of the jewel-house is made master
o' the rolls and the king's secretary further sir
stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments
with which the time will load him The archbishop
is the king's hand and tongue and who dare speak
one syllable against him

yes yes Sir Thomas
there are that dare and I myself have ventur'd
to speak my mind of him and indeed this day
sir I may tell it you I think I have
incens'd the lords o' the council that he is
for so I know he is they know he is
a most arch heretic a pestilence
that does infect the land with which they mov'd
given ear to our complaint of his great grace
and princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
our reasons laid before him hath commanded
to-morrow morning to the council-board
he be convented He's a rank weed Sir Thomas
and we must root him out From your affairs
I hinder you too long good-night Sir Thomas

many good-nights my lord I rest your servant

Charles I will play no more to-night
my mind's not on't you are too hard for me

sir I did never win of you before

but little Charles
nor shall not when my fancy's on my play
now Lovell from the queen what is the news

what you commanded me but by her woman
I sent your message who return'd her thanks
in the great'st humbleness and desir'd your highness
most heartily to pray for her

what sayst thou ha
to pray for her what is she crying out

so said her woman and that her sufferance made
almost each pang a death

alas good lady

God safely quit her of her burden and
with gentle travail to the gladding of
your highness with an heir

'Tis midnight Charles
prithee to bed and in thy prayers remember
for I must think of that which company
would not be friendly to

I wish your highness
a quiet night and my good mistress will
remember in my prayers

Charles good-night


well Sir what follows

sir I have brought my lord the archbishop
as you commanded me

ha Canterbury

ay my good lord


he attends your highness' pleasure

bring him to us


this is about that which the bishop spake
I am happily come hither


avoid the gallery

ha I have said Begone
what


I am fearful Wherefore frowns he thus
'Tis his aspect of terror all's not well

wherefore I sent for you

it is my duty
to attend your highness' pleasure

pray you arise
my good and gracious Lord of Canterbury
come you and I must walk a turn together
I have news to tell you come come give me your hand
Ah my good lord I grieve at what I speak
and am right sorry to repeat what follows
I have and most unwillingly of late
heard many grievous I do say my lord
grievous complaints of you which being consider'd
have mov'd us and our council that you shall
this morning come before us where I know
you cannot with such freedom purge yourself
but that till further trial in those charges
which will require your answer you must take
to make your house our Tower you a brother of us
it fits we thus proceed or else no witness
would come against you

I humbly thank your highness
and am right glad to catch this good occasion
most throughly to be winnow'd where my chaff
and corn shall fly asunder for I know
there's none stands under more calumnious tongues
than I myself poor man

stand up good Canterbury
thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
in us thy friend give me thy hand stand up
prithee let's walk Now by my holidame
what manner of man are you My lord I look'd
you would have given me your petition that
I should have ta'en some pains to bring together
yourself and your accusers and to have heard you

most dread liege
the good I stand on is my truth and honesty
if they shall fail I with mine enemies
will triumph o'er my person which I weigh not
being of those virtues vacant I fear nothing
what can be said against me

know you not
how your state stands i' the world with the whole world
your enemies are many and not small their practices
must bear the same proportion and not ever
the justice and the truth o' the question carries
the due o' the verdict with it At what ease
might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
to swear against you such things have been done
you are potently oppos'd and with a malice
of as great size Ween you of better luck
I mean in perjur'd witness than your master
upon this naughty earth Go to go to
you take a precipice for no leap of danger
and woo your own destruction

God and your majesty
protect mine innocence or I fall into
the trap is laid for me

be of good cheer
they shall no more prevail than we give way to
keep comfort to you and this morning see
you do appear before them If they shall chance
in charging you with matters to commit you
the best persuasions to the contrary
fail not to use and with what vehemency
the occasion shall instruct you if entreaties
will render you no remedy this ring
deliver them and your appeal to us
there make before them Look the good man weeps
I swear he is true-hearted and a soul
none better in my kingdom Get you gone
and do as I have bid you

he has strangled
his language in his tears


come back what mean you

I'll not come back the tidings that I bring
will make my boldness manners Now good angels
fly o'er thy royal head and shade thy person
under their blessed wings

now by thy looks
I guess thy message Is the queen deliver'd
say ay and of a boy

and of a lovely boy the God of heaven
both now and ever bless her tis a girl
promises boys hereafter Sir your queen
desires your visitation and to be
acquainted with this stranger tis as like you
as cherry is to cherry

Lovell


sir

give her a hundred marks I'll to the queen


a hundred marks By this light I'll ha' more
an ordinary groom is for such payment
I will have more or scold it out of him
said I for this the girl was like to him
while it is hot I'll put it to the issue


I hope I am not too late and yet the gentleman
that was sent to me from the council pray'd me
to make great haste All fast what means this Ho
who waits there

sure you know me

yes my lord
but yet I cannot help you

why

your Grace must wait till you be call'd for


so
this is a piece of malice I am glad
I came this way so happily the king
shall understand it presently

'Tis Butts
the king's physician As he past along
how earnestly he cast his eyes upon me
pray heaven he sound not my disgrace For certain
this is of purpose laid by some that hate me
God turn their hearts I never sought their malice
to quench mine honour they would shame to make me
wait else at door a fellow-counsellor
'Mong boys grooms and lackeys But their pleasures
must be fulfill'd and I attend with patience


I'll show your Grace the strangest sight

what's that Butts
I think your highness saw this many a day

body o' me where is it

there my lord
the high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury
who holds his state at door mongst pursuivants
pages and footboys

ha Tis he indeed
is this the honour they do one another
'Tis well there's one above em yet I had thought
they had parted so much honesty among em
at least good manners as not thus to suffer
a man of his place and so near our favour
to dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures
and at the door too like a post with packets
by holy Mary Butts there's knavery
let em alone and draw the curtain close


speak to the business Master secretary
why are we met in council

please your honours
the chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury

has he had knowledge of it

yes

who waits there

without my noble lords

yes

my lord archbishop

let him come in

your Grace may enter now


my good lord archbishop I'm very sorry
to sit here at this present and behold
that chair stand empty but we all are men
in our own natures frail and capable
of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
and want of wisdom you that best should teach us
have misdemean'd yourself and not a little
toward the king first then his laws in filling
the whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
for so we are inform'd with new opinions
divers and dangerous which are heresies
and not reform'd may prove pernicious

my noble lords for those that tame wild horses
pace em not in their hands to make em gentle
but stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur em
till they obey the manage If we suffer
out of our easiness and childish pity
to one man's honour this contagious sickness
farewell all physic and what follows then
commotions uproars with a general taint
of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
the upper Germany can dearly witness
yet freshly pitied in our memories

my good lords hitherto in all the progress
both of my life and office I have labour'd
and with no little study that my teaching
and the strong course of my authority
might go one way and safely and the end
was ever to do well nor is there living
I speak it with a single heart my lords
both in his private conscience and his place
defacers of a public peace than I do
pray heaven the king may never find a heart
with less allegiance in it Men that make
envy and crooked malice nourishment
dare bite the best I do beseech your lordships
that in this case of justice my accusers
be what they will may stand forth face to face
and freely urge against me

nay my lord
that cannot be you are a counsellor
and by that virtue no man dare accuse you

my lord because we have business of more moment
we will be short with you Tis his highness' pleasure
and our consent for better trial of you
from hence you be committed to the Tower
where being but a private man again
more than I fear you are provided for

Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thank you
you are always my good friend if your will pass
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror
you are so merciful I see your end
'Tis my undoing love and meekness lord
become a churchman better than ambition
win straying souls with modesty again
cast none away That I shall clear myself
lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
I make as little doubt as you do conscience
in doing daily wrongs I could say more
but reverence to your calling makes me modest

my lord my lord you are a sectary
that's the plain truth your painted gloss discovers
to men that understand you words and weakness

by your good favour too sharp men so noble
however faulty yet should find respect
for what they have been tis a cruelty
to load a falling man

good Master secretary
I cry your honour mercy you may worst
of all this table say so

why my lord

do not I know you for a favourer
of this new sect ye are not sound

not sound

not sound I say

would you were half so honest

I shall remember this bold language

do
remember your bold life too

this is too much
forbear for shame my lords

I have done

and I

then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
I take it by all voices that forthwith
you be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner
there to remain till the king's further pleasure
be known unto us Are you all agreed lords


is there no other way of mercy
but I must needs to the Tower my lords

what other
would you expect You are strangely troublesome
let some o' the guard be ready there


for me
must I go like a traitor thither

receive him
and see him safe i' the Tower

stay good my lords
I have a little yet to say Look there my lords
by virtue of that ring I take my cause
out of the gripes of cruel men and give it

this is the king's ring

'Tis no counterfeit

'Tis the right ring by heaven I told ye all
when we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling
'Twould fall upon ourselves

do you think my lords
the king will suffer but the little finger
of this man to be vex'd

'Tis now too certain
how much more is his life in value with him
would I were fairly out on't

my mind gave me
in seeking tales and informations
and his disciples only envy at
ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye


dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
in daily thanks that gave us such a prince
not only good and wise but most religious
one that in all obedience makes the Church
the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
that holy duty out of dear respect
his royal self in judgment comes to hear
the cause betwixt her and this great offender

you were ever good at sudden commendations
bishop of Winchester but know I come not
to hear such flattery now and in my presence
they are too thin and bare to hide offences
to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
and think with wagging of your tongue to win me
thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody


good man sit down Now let me see the proudest
he that dares most but wag his finger at thee
by all that's holy he had better starve
than but once think this place becomes thee not

may it please your Grace

no sir it does not please me
I had thought I had had men of some understanding
and wisdom of my council but I find none
was it discretion lords to let this man
this good man few of you deserve that title
this honest man wait like a lousy footboy
at chamber-door and one as great as you are
why what a shame was this Did my commission
bid ye so far forget yourselves I gave ye
not as a groom There's some of ye I see
more out of malice than integrity
would try him to the utmost had ye mean
which ye shall never have while I live

thus far
my most dread sov'reign may it like your Grace
to let my tongue excuse all What was purpos'd
concerning his imprisonment was rather
if there be faith in men meant for his trial
and fair purgation to the world than malice
I'm sure in me

well well my lords respect him
take him and use him well he's worthy of it
I will say thus much for him if a prince
may be beholding to a subject I
am for his love and service so to him
make me no more ado but all embrace him
I have a suit which you must not deny me
that is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
you must be godfather and answer for her

the greatest monarch now alive may glory
in such an honour how may I deserve it
that am a poor and humble subject to you

come come my lord you'd spare your spoons you shall have two noble partners with you the old Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquess Dorset will these please you
once more my Lord of Winchester I charge you
embrace and love this man

with a true heart
and brother-love I do it

and let heaven
witness how dear I hold this confirmation

good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
of thee which says thus Do my Lord of Canterbury
a shrewd turn and he is your friend for ever
come lords we trifle time away I long
to have this young one made a Christian
as I have made ye one lords one remain
so I grow stronger you more honour gain


you'll leave your noise anon ye rascals
do you take the court for Paris-garden ye rude slaves leave your gaping


good Master porter I belong to the larder

belong to the gallows and be hanged you rogue Is this a place to roar in Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves and strong ones these are but switches to em I'll scratch your heads you must be seeing christenings Do you look for ale and cakes here you rude rascals

pray sir be patient tis as much impossible
unless we sweep em from the door with cannons
to scatter em as tis to make em sleep
we may as well push against Paul's as stir em

how got they in and be hang'd

alas I know not how gets the tide in
as much as one sound cudgel of four foot
you see the poor remainder could distribute
I made no spare sir

you did nothing sir

I am not Samson nor Sir Guy nor Colbrand
to mow em down before me but if I spar'd any
that had a head to hit either young or old
he or she cuckold or cuckold-maker
let me ne'er hope to see a chine again
and that I would not for a cow God save her



I shall be with you presently good
master puppy Keep the door close sirrah

what would you have me do

what should you do but knock em down by the dozens Is this Moorfields to muster in or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court the women so besiege us Bless me what a fry of fornication is at door On my Christian conscience this one christening will beget a thousand here will be father godfather and all together

the spoons will be the bigger sir There is a fellow somewhat near the door he should be a brazier by his face for o' my conscience twenty of the dog days now reign in's nose all that stand about him are under the line they need no other penance That fire-drake did I hit three times on the head and three times was his nose discharged against me he stands there like a mortar-piece to blow us There was a haberdasher's wife of small wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in the state I missed the meteor once and hit that woman who cried out Clubs when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succour which were the hope o' the Strand where she was quartered They fell on I made good my place at length they came to the broomstaff to me I defied em still when suddenly a file of boys behind em loose shot delivered such a shower of pebbles that I was fain to draw mine honour in and let em win the work The devil was amongst em I think surely

these are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten apples that no audience but the Tribulation of Tower-hill or the Limbs of Limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure I have some of em in Limbo Patrum and there they are like to dance these three days besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come


mercy o' me what a multitude are here
they grow still too from all parts they are coming
as if we kept a fair here Where are these porters
these lazy knaves Ye have made a fine hand fellows
there's a trim rabble let in Are all these
your faithful friends o' the suburbs We shall have
when they pass back from the christening

an't please your honour
we are but men and what so many may do
not being torn a-pieces we have done
an army cannot rule em

as I live
if the king blame me for't I'll lay ye all
by the heels and suddenly and on your heads
clap round fines for neglect ye're lazy knaves
and here ye lie baiting of bombards when
ye should do service Hark the trumpets sound
they're come already from the christening
go break among the press and find a way out
to let the troop pass fairly or I'll find
a Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months

make way there for the princess
you great fellow
stand close up or I'll make your head ache

you i' the camlet get up o' the rail
I'll pick you o'er the pales else

heaven from thy endless goodness send prosperous life long and ever happy to the high and mighty Princess of England Elizabeth


and to your royal Grace and the good queen
my noble partners and myself thus pray
all comfort joy in this most gracious lady
heaven ever laid up to make parents happy
may hourly fall upon ye

thank you good lord archbishop
what is her name

Elizabeth
stand up lord

with this kiss take my blessing God protect thee
into whose hand I give thy life

amen

my noble gossips ye have been too prodigal
I thank ye heartily so shall this lady
when she has so much English

let me speak sir
for heaven now bids me and the words I utter
let none think flattery for they'll find em truth
this royal infant heaven still move about her
though in her cradle yet now promises
upon this land a thousand thousand blessings
which time shall bring to ripeness she shall be
but few now living can behold that goodness
and all that shall succeed Saba was never
more covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
than this pure soul shall be all princely graces
that mould up such a mighty piece as this is
with all the virtues that attend the good
shall still be doubled on her truth shall nurse her
holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her
she shall be lov'd and fear'd her own shall bless her
her foes shake like a field of beaten corn
and hang their heads with sorrow good grows with her
in her days every man shall eat in safety
under his own vine what he plants and sing
the merry songs of peace to all his neighbours
God shall be truly known and those about her
from her shall read the perfect ways of honour
and by those claim their greatness not by blood
nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when
the bird of wonder dies the maiden ph nix
her ashes new-create another heir
so shall she leave her blessedness to one
when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness
who from the sacred ashes of her honour
shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was
and so stand fix'd Peace plenty love truth terror
that were the servants to this chosen infant
shall then be his and like a vine grow to him
wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine
his honour and the greatness of his name
shall be and make new nations he shall flourish
and like a mountain cedar reach his branches
to all the plains about him our children's children
shall see this and bless heaven

thou speakest wonders

she shall be to the happiness of England
an aged princess many days shall see her
and yet no day without a deed to crown it
she must the saints must have her yet a virgin
a most unspotted lily shall she pass
to the ground and all the world shall mourn her

O lord archbishop
thou hast made me now a man never before
this happy child did I get any thing
this oracle of comfort has so pleas'd me
that when I am in heaven I shall desire
to see what this child does and praise my Maker
I thank ye all To you my good Lord Mayor
and your good brethren I am much beholding
I have receiv'd much honour by your presence
and ye shall find me thankful Lead the way lords
ye must all see the queen and she must thank ye
she will be sick else This day no man think
he has business at his house for all shall stay
this little one shall make it holiday

'Tis ten to one this play can never please
all that are here some come to take their ease
and sleep an act or two but those we fear
we've frighted with our trumpets so tis clear
they'll say tis naught others to hear the city
abus'd extremely and to cry That's witty
which we have not done neither that I fear
all the expected good we're like to hear
for this play at this time is only in
the merciful construction of good women
for such a one we show'd em if they smile
and say twill do I know within a while
all the best men are ours for tis ill hap
if they hold when their ladies bid em clap

THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY IV

so shaken as we are so wan with care
find we a time for frighted peace to pant
to be commenc'd in stronds afar remote
no more the thirsty entrance of this soil
shall daub her lips with her own children's blood
no more shall trenching war channel her fields
nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
of hostile paces those opposed eyes
which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
all of one nature of one substance bred
did lately meet in the intestine shock
and furious close of civil butchery
shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks
march all one way and be no more oppos'd
against acquaintance kindred and allies
the edge of war like an ill-sheathed knife
no more shall cut his master Therefore friends
as far as to the sepulchre of Christ
whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
we are impressed and engag'd to fight
forthwith a power of English shall we levy
to chase these pagans in those holy fields
over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
for our advantage on the bitter cross
but this our purpose is a twelvemonth old
and bootless tis to tell you we will go
therefore we meet not now Then let me hear
of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland
what yesternight our council did decree
in forwarding this dear expedience

my liege this haste was hot in question
and many limits of the charge set down
but yesternight when all athwart there came
a post from Wales loaden with heavy news
whose worst was that the noble Mortimer
leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
against the irregular and wild Glendower
was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken
upon whose dead corpse' there was such misuse
such beastly shameless transformation
by those Welshwomen done as may not be
without much shame re-told or spoken of

it seems then that the tidings of this broil
brake off our business for the Holy Land

this match'd with other like my gracious lord
for more uneven and unwelcome news
came from the north and thus it did import
on Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there
young Harry Percy and brave Archibald
that ever-valiant and approved Scot
at Holmedon met
where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
as by discharge of their artillery
and shape of likelihood the news was told
for he that brought them in the very heat
uncertain of the issue any way

here is a dear and true industrious friend
sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse
stain'd with the variation of each soil
betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours
and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
the Earl of Douglas is discomfited
ten thousand bold Scots two and twenty knights
balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
on Holmedon's plains of prisoners Hotspur took
Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son
to beaten Douglas and the Earls of Athol
of Murray Angus and Menteith
and is not this an honourable spoil
a gallant prize ha cousin is it not

in faith
it is a conquest for a prince to boast of
yea there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin
in envy that my Lord Northumberland
should be the father to so blest a son
a son who is the theme of honour's tongue
amongst a grove the very straightest plant
who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride
whilst I by looking on the praise of him
see riot and dishonour stain the brow
of my young Harry O that it could be prov'd
that some night-tripping fairy had exchang'd
in cradle-clothes our children where they lay
and call'd mine Percy his Plantagenet
then would I have his Harry and he mine
but let him from my thoughts What think you coz
of this young Percy's pride the prisoners
which he in this adventure hath surpris'd
to his own use he keeps and sends me word
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife

malevolent to you in all aspects
which makes him prune himself and bristle up
the crest of youth against your dignity

but I have sent for him to answer this
and for this cause a while we must neglect
our holy purpose to Jerusalem
cousin on Wednesday next our council we
will hold at Windsor so inform the lords
but come yourself with speed to us again
for more is to be said and to be done
than out of anger can be uttered

I will my hege


now Hal what time of day is it lad

thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colour'd taffeta I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day
indeed you come near me now Hal for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not by Ph bus he that wandering knight so fair And I prithee sweet wag when thou art king as God save thy Grace majesty I should say for grace thou wilt have none

what none

no by my troth not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter

well how then come roundly roundly

marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's beauty let us be Diana's foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the moon and let men say we be men of good government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal

thou sayest well and it holds well too for the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea being governed as the sea is by the moon As for proof now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning got with swearing Lay by and spent with crying Bring in now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows

by the Lord thou sayest true lad And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench

as the honey of Hybla my old lad of the castle And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance

how now how now mad wag what in thy quips and thy quiddities what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin

why what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern
well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft

did I ever call for thee to pay thy part

no I'll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there

yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch and where it would not I have used my credit

yea and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art their apparent But I prithee sweet wag shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antick the law Do not thou when thou art king hang a thief

no thou shalt

shall I O rare By the Lord I'll be a brave judge

thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman

well Hal well and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court I can tell you

for obtaining of suits
yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe Sblood I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear

or an old lion or a lover's lute

yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe

what sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of Moor-ditch

thou hast the most unsavory similes and art indeed the most comparative rascalliest sweet young prince but Hal I prithee trouble me no more with vanity I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought An old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you sir but I marked him not and yet he talked very wisely but I regarded him not and yet he talked wisely and in the street too

thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it

O thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint Thou hast done much harm upon me Hal God forgive thee for it Before I knew thee Hal I knew nothing and now am I if a man should speak truly little better than one of the wicked I must give over this life and I will give it over by the Lord an I do not I am a villain I'll be damned for never a king's son in Christendom

where shall we take a purse to-morrow Jack

Zounds where thou wilt lad I'll make one an I do not call me a villain and baffle me

I see a good amendment of life in thee from praying to purse-taking

why Hal tis my vocation Hal tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation Poins Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match O if men were to be saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for him This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand to a true man

good morrow Ned

good morrow sweet Hal What says Monsieur Remorse What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar Jack how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg

sir John stands to his word the devil shall have his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs he will give the devil his due

then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil

else he had been damned for cozening the devil

but my lads my lads to-morrow morning by four o'clock early at Gadshill There are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings and traders riding to London with fat purses I have vizards for you all you have horses for yourselves Gadshill lies to night in Rochester I have bespoke supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap we may do it as secure as sleep If you will go I will stuff your purses full of crowns if you will not tarry at home and be hanged

hear ye Yedward if I tarry at home and go not I'll hang you for going

you will chops


who I rob I a thief not I by my faith

there's neither honesty manhood nor good fellowship in thee nor thou camest not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings

well then once in my days I'll be a madcap

why that's well said

well come what will I'll tarry at home

by the Lord I'll be a traitor then when thou art king

I care not

sir John I prithee leave the prince and me alone I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go

well God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed that the true prince may for recreation sake prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the time want countenance Farewell you shall find me in Eastcheap



now my good sweet honey lord ride with us to-morrow I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone Falstaff Bardolph Peto and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid yourself and I will not be there and when they have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut this head from my shoulders

but how shall we part with them in setting forth

why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them

yea but tis like that they will know us by our horses by our habits and by every other appointment to be ourselves

tut our horses they shall not see I'll tie them in the wood our vizards we will change after we leave them and sirrah I have cases of buckram for the nonce to inmask our noted outward garments

yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us

well for two of them I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back and for the third if he fight longer than he sees reason I'll forswear arms The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest

well I'll go with thee provide us all things necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap there I'll sup Farewell

farewell my lord

I know you all and will awhile uphold
the unyok'd humour of your idleness
yet herein will I imitate the sun
who doth permit the base contagious clouds
to smother up his beauty from the world
that when he please again to be himself
being wanted he may be more wonder'd at
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
of vapours that did seem to strangle him
if all the year were playing holidays
to sport would be as tedious as to work
but when they seldom come they wish'd for come
and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
so when this loose behaviour I throw off
and pay the debt I never promised
by how much better than my word I am
by so much shall I falsify men's hopes
and like bright metal on a sullen ground
shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
than that which hath no foil to set it off
I'll so offend to make offence a skill
redeeming time when men think least I will


my blood hath been too cold and temperate
unapt to stir at these indignities
and you have found me for accordingly
you tread upon my patience but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself
mighty and to be fear'd than my condition
which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
and therefore lost that title of respect
which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud

our house my sovereign liege little deserves
the scourge of greatness to be us'd on it
and that same greatness too which our own hands

my lord

Worcester get thee gone for I do see
danger and disobedience in thine eye
O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
and majesty might never yet endure
the moody frontier of a servant brow
you have good leave to leave us when we need
your use and counsel we shall send for you

you were about to speak

yea my good lord
those prisoners in your highness' name demanded
which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took
were as he says not with such strength denied
as is deliver'd to your majesty
either envy therefore or misprision

my liege I did deny no prisoners
but I remember when the fight was done
when I was dry with rage and extreme toil
breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd
fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd
show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home
he was perfumed like a milliner
and twixt his finger and his thumb he held
a pouncet-box which ever and anon
he gave his nose and took't away again
who therewith angry when it next came there
took it in snuff and still he smil'd and talk'd
and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
he call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly
to bring a slovenly unhandsome corpse
betwixt the wind and his nobility
with many holiday and lady terms
my prisoners in your majesty's behalf
I then all smarting with my wounds being cold
to be so pester'd with a popinjay
out of my grief and my impatience
answer'd neglectingly I know not what
he should or he should not for he made me mad
to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
and talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
of guns and drums and wounds God save the mark
and telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
was parmaceti for an inward bruise
and that it was great pity so it was
this villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
out of the bowels of the harmless earth
which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
so cowardly and but for these vile guns
he would himself have been a soldier
this bald unjointed chat of his my lord
I answer'd indirectly as I said
come current for an accusation
betwixt my love and your high majesty

the circumstance consider'd good my lord
whatever Harry Percy then had said
to such a person and in such a place
at such a time with all the rest re-told
may reasonably die and never rise
to do him wrong or any way impeach
what then he said so he unsay it now

why yet he doth deny his prisoners
but with proviso and exception
that we at our own charge shall ransom straight
his brother-in-law the foolish Mortimer
who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd
the lives of those that he did lead to fight
against the great magician damn'd Glendower
whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March
be emptied to redeem a traitor home
shall we buy treason and indent with fears
when they have lost and forfeited themselves
no on the barren mountains let him starve
for I shall never hold that man my friend
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
to ransom home revolted Mortimer

revolted Mortimer
he never did fall off my sovereign liege
but by the chance of war to prove that true
needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
when on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank
in single opposition hand to hand
he did confound the best part of an hour
in changing hardiment with great Glendower
three times they breath'd and three times did they drink
upon agreement of swift Severn's flood
ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
blood-stained with these valiant combatants
never did base and rotten policy
colour her working with such deadly wounds
nor never could the noble Mortimer
receive so many and all willingly
then let him not be slander'd with revolt

thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him
he never did encounter with Glendower
I tell thee
he durst as well have met the devil alone
as Owen Glendower for an enemy
art thou not asham'd But sirrah henceforth
let me not hear you speak of Mortimer
send me your prisoners with the speediest means
or you shall hear in such a kind from me
as will displease you My Lord Northumberland
send us your prisoners or you'll hear of it


an if the devil come and roar for them
I will not send them I will after straight
and tell him so for I will ease my heart
albeit I make a hazard of my head

what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
here comes your uncle


speak of Mortimer
'Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul
want mercy if I do not join with him
in his behalf I'll empty all these veins
and shed my dear blood drop by drop i' the dust
but I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
as high i' the air as this unthankful king

brother the king hath made your nephew mad

who struck this heat up after I was gone

he will forsooth have all my prisoners
and when I urg'd the ransom once again
of my wife's brother then his cheek look'd pale
and on my face he turn'd an eye of death
trembling even at the name of Mortimer

I cannot blame him was he not proclaim'd
by Richard that dead is the next of blood

he was I heard the proclamation
and then it was when the unhappy king
whose wrongs in us God pardon did set forth
upon his Irish expedition
from whence he intercepted did return

and for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of

but soft I pray you did King Richard then
proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
heir to the crown

he did myself did hear it

nay then I cannot blame his cousin king
that wish'd him on the barren mountains starve
but shall it be that you that set the crown
upon the head of this forgetful man
and for his sake wear the detested blot
of murd'rous subornation shall it be
that you a world of curses undergo
being the agents or base second means
the cords the ladder or the hangman rather
to show the line and the predicament
wherein you range under this subtle king
shall it for shame be spoken in these days
or fill up chronicles in time to come
that men of your nobility and power
did gage them both in'an unjust behalf
as both of you God pardon it have done
to put down Richard that sweet lovely rose
and plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke
and shall it in more shame be further spoken
that you are fool'd discarded and shook off
by him for whom these shames ye underwent
no yet time serves wherein you may redeem
your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
into the good thoughts of the world again
revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
of this proud king who studies day and night
to answer all the debt he owes to you
even with the bloody payment of your deaths

peace cousin say no more
and now I will unclasp a secret book
and to your quick-conceiving discontents
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous
as full of peril and adventurous spirit
as to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
on the unsteadfast footing of a spear

if he fall in good night or sink or swim
send danger from the east unto the west
so honour cross it from the north to south
and let them grapple O the blood more stirs
to rouse a lion than to start a hare

imagination of some great exploit
drives him beyond the bounds of patience

by heaven methinks it were an easy leap
or dive into the bottom of the deep
where fathom-line could never touch the ground
and pluck up drowned honour by the locks
so he that doth redeem her thence might wear
without corrival all her dignities
but out upon this half-fac'd fellowship

he apprehends a world of figures here
but not the form of what he should attend
good cousin give me audience for a while

I cry you mercy

those same noble Scots
that are your prisoners

I'll keep them all
by God he shall not have a Scot of them
no if a Scot would save his soul he shall not

you start away
and lend no ear unto my purposes
those prisoners you shall keep

nay I will that's flat
he said he would not ransom Mortimer
forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer
but I will find him when he lies asleep
and in his ear I'll holla Mortimer
nay
I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
nothing but Mortimer and give it him
to keep his anger still in motion

hear you cousin a word

all studies here I solemnly defy
save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke
but that I think his father loves him not
and would be glad he met with some mischance
I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale

farewell kinsman I will talk to you
when you are better temper'd to attend

why what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
art thou to break into this woman's mood
tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own

why look you I am whipp'd and scourg'd with rods
nettled and stung with pismires when I hear
of this vile politician Bolingbroke
in Richard's time what do ye call the place
a plague upon't it is in Gloucestershire
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
his uncle York where I first bow'd my knee
unto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke
when you and he came back from Ravenspurgh

at Berkeley Castle

you say true
why what a candy deal of courtesy
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me
look when his infant fortune came to age
and gentle Harry Percy and kind cousin
O the devil take such cozeners God forgive me
good uncle tell your tale for I have done

nay if you have not to't again
we'll stay your leisure

I have done i' faith

then once more to your Scottish prisoners
deliver them up without their ransom straight
for powers in Scotland which for divers reasons
which I shall send you written be assur'd
will easily be granted

you my lord
your son in Scotland being thus employ'd
shall secretly into the bosom creep
of that same noble prelate well belov'd
the Archbishop

of York is it not

true who bears hard
his brother's death at Bristol the Lord Scroop
I speak not this in estimation
as what I think might be but what I know
is ruminated plotted and set down
and only stays but to behold the face
of that occasion that shall bring it on
I smell it
upon my life it will do wondrous well

before the game's afoot thou still lett'st slip

why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
and then the power of Scotland and of York
to join with Mortimer ha

and so they shall

in faith it is exceedingly well aim'd

and tis no little reason bids us speed
to save our heads by raising of a head
for bear ourselves as even as we can
the king will always think him in our debt
and think we think ourselves unsatisfied
till he hath found a time to pay us home
to make us strangers to his looks of love

he does he does we'll be reveng'd on him

cousin farewell no further go in this
than I by letters shall direct your course
when time is ripe which will be suddenly
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer
where you and Douglas and our powers at once
as I will fashion it shall happily meet
to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
which now we hold at much uncertainty

farewell good brother we shall thrive I trust

uncle adieu O let the hours be short
till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport

heigh-ho An't be not four by the day I'll be hanged Charles' Wain is over the new chimney and yet our horse not packed What ostler
anon anon

I prithee Tom beat Cut's saddle put a few flocks in the point the poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess


peas and beans are as dank here as a dog and that is the next way to give poor jades the bots this house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died

poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose it was the death of him

I think this be the most villanous house in all London road for fleas I am stung like a tench

like a tench by the mass there is ne'er a king christen could be better bit than I have been since the first cock

why they will allow us ne'er a jordan and then we leak in the chimney and your chamber-lie breeds fleas like a loach

what ostler come away and be hanged come away

I have a gammon of bacon and two razes of ginger to be delivered as far as Charing-cross



good morrow carriers What's o'clock

I think it be two o'clock

I prithee lend me thy lanthorn to see my gelding in the stable

nay by God soft I know a trick worth two of that i' faith

I prithee lend me thine

ay when canst tell Lend me thy lanthorn quoth a' marry I'll see thee hanged first

sirrah carrier what time do you mean to come to London

time enough to go to bed with a candle I warrant thee Come neighbour Mugs we'll call up the gentlemen they will along with company for they have great charge



'At hand quoth pick-purse

that's even as fair as at hand quoth the chamberlain' for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from labouring thou layest the plot how


good morrow Master Gadshill It holds current that I told you yesternight there's a franklin in the wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper a kind of auditor one that hath abundance of charge too God knows what They are up already and call for eggs and butter they will away presently

sirrah if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks I'll give thee this neck

no I'll none of it I prithee keep that for the hangman for I know thou worship'st Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may

what talkest thou to me of the hangman If I hang I'll make a fat pair of gallows for if I hang old Sir John hangs with me and thou knowest he's no starveling Tut there are other Troyans that thou dreamest not of the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace that would if matters should be looked into for their own credit sake make all whole I am joined with no foot-land-rakers no long-staff sixpenny strikers none of these mad mustachio-purple-hued malt worms but with nobility and tranquillity burgomasters and great oneyers such as can hold in such as will strike sooner than speak and speak sooner than drink and drink sooner than pray and yet I lie for they pray continually to their saint the commonwealth or rather not pray to her but prey on her for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots

what the commonwealth their boots will she hold out water in foul way

she will she will justice hath liquored her We steal as in a castle cock-sure we have the receipt of fern-seed we walk invisible

nay by my faith I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible
give me thy hand thou shalt have a share in our purchase as I am a true man

nay rather let me have it as you are a false thief

go to homo is a common name to all men Bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable Farewell you muddy knave


come shelter shelter I have removed Falstaff's horse and he frets like a gummed velvet

stand close

thou liest thou art not colted thou art uncolted

I prithee good Prince Hal help me to my horse good king's son

O tis our setter I know his voice

your money

villains


got with much ease Now merrily to horse
the thieves are scatter'd and possess'd with fear
so strongly that they dare not meet each other
each takes his fellow for an officer
away good Ned Falstaff sweats to death
and lards the lean earth as he walks along
were't not for laughing I should pity him

how the rogue roar'd


but for mine own part my lord I could be well contented to be there in respect of the love I bear your house

he could be contented why is he not then In respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house Let me see some more
the purpose you undertake is dangerous

why that's certain tis dangerous to take a cold to sleep to drink but I tell you my lord fool out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety

the purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends you have named uncertain the time itself unsorted and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition

say you so say you so I say unto you again you are a shallow cowardly hind and you lie What a lack-brain is this By the Lord our plot is a good plot as ever was laid our friends true and constant a good plot good friends and full of expectation an excellent plot very good friends What a frosty-spirited rogue is this Why my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action Zounds an I were now by this rascal I could brain him with his lady's fan Is there not my father my uncle and myself Lord Edmund Mortimer my Lord of York and Owen Glendower Is there not besides the Douglas Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month and are they not some of them set forward already What a pagan rascal is this an infidel Ha you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the king and lay open all our proceedings O I could divide myself and go to buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action Hang him let him tell the king we are prepared I will set forward to-night

how now Kate I must leave you within these two hours

O my good lord why are you thus alone
for what offence have I this fortnight been
a banish'd woman from my Harry's bed
tell me sweet lord what is't that takes from thee
thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep
why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth
and start so often when thou sitt'st alone
why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
and given my treasures and my rights of thee
in thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd
and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars
speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed
cry Courage to the field And thou hast talk'd
of sallies and retires of trenches tents
of palisadoes frontiers parapets
of basilisks of cannon culverin
of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain
and all the currents of a heady fight
thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
and thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep
that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream
and in thy face strange motions have appear'd
such as we see when men restrain their breath
on some great sudden hest O what portents are these
some heavy business hath my lord in hand
and I must know it else he loves me not


is Gilliams with the packet gone

he is my lord an hour ago

hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff

one horse my lord he brought even now

what horse a roan a crop-ear is it not

it is my lord

that roan shall be my throne
well I will back him straight O Esperance
bid Butler lead him forth into the park


but hear you my lord
what sayst thou my lady

what is it carries you away

why my horse my love my horse

out you mad-headed ape
a weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
as you are toss'd with In faith
I'll know your business Harry that I will
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
about his title and hath sent for you
to line his enterprise But if you go

so far afoot I shall be weary love

come come you paraquito answer me
directly unto this question that I ask
in faith I'll break thy little finger Harry

away
away you trifler Love I love thee not
I care not for thee Kate this is no world
to play with mammets and to tilt with lips
we must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns
and pass them current too God's me my horse
what sayst thou Kate what wouldst thou have with me

do you not love me do you not indeed
well do not then for since you love me not
I will not love myself Do you not love me
nay tell me if you speak in jest or no

come wilt thou see me ride
and when I am o' horseback I will swear
I love thee infinitely But hark you Kate
I must not have you henceforth question me
whither I go nor reason whereabout
this evening must I leave you gentle Kate
I know you wise but yet no further wise
than Harry Percy's wife constant you are
but yet a woman and for secrecy
no lady closer for I well believe
thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know
and so far will I trust thee gentle Kate

how so far

not an inch further But hark you Kate
whither I go thither shall you go too
to-day will I set forth to-morrow you
will this content you Kate

it must of force


Ned prithee come out of that fat room and lend me thy hand to laugh a little
where hast been Hal

with three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads I have sounded the very base string of humility Sirrah I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers and can call them all by their christen names as Tom Dick and Francis They take it already upon their salvation that though I be but Prince of Wales yet I am the king of courtesy and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff but a Corinthian a lad of mettle a good boy by the Lord so they call me and when I am king of England I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap They call drinking deep dyeing scarlet and when you breathe in your watering they cry hem and bid you play it off To conclude I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life I tell thee Ned thou hast lost much honour that thou wert not with me in this action But sweet Ned to sweeten which name of Ned I give thee this pennyworth of sugar clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker one that never spake other English in his life than Eight shillings and sixpence and You are welcome with this shrill addition Anon anon sir Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon or so But Ned to drive away the time till Falstaff come I prithee do thou stand in some by-room while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar and do thou never leave calling Francis that his tale to me may be nothing but Anon Step aside and I'll show thee a precedent

what's o'clock Francis

anon anon sir


that ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot and yet the son of a woman His industry is up-stairs and down-stairs his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning I am not yet of Percy's mind the Hotspur of the North he that kills me some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast washes his hands and says to his wife Fie upon this quiet life I want work O my sweet Harry says she how many hast thou killed to-day Give my roan horse a drench says he and answers Some fourteen an hour after a trifle a trifle I prithee call in Falstaff I'll play Percy and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife Rivo says the drunkard Call in ribs call in tallow


welcome Jack where hast thou been

a plague of all cowards I say and a vengeance too marry and amen Give me a cup of sack boy Ere I lead this life long I'll sew nether-stocks and mend them and foot them too A plague of all cowards Give me a cup of sack rogue Is there no virtue extant


didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter pitiful-hearted Titan that melted at the sweet tale of the sun if thou didst then behold that compound

you rogue here's lime in this sack too there is nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it a villanous coward Go thy ways old Jack die when thou wilt If manhood good manhood be not forgot upon the face of the earth then am I a shotten herring There live not three good men unhanged in England and one of them is fat and grows old God help the while a bad world I say I would I were a weaver I could sing psalms or anything A plague of all cowards I say still
how now wool-sack what mutter you

a king's son If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese I'll never wear hair on my face more You Prince of Wales

why you whoreson round man what's the matter

are you not a coward answer me to that and Poins there

'Zounds ye fat paunch an ye call me coward I'll stab thee

I call thee coward I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst You are straight enough in the shoulders you care not who sees your back call you that backing of your friends A plague upon such backing give me them that will face me Give me a cup of sack I am a rogue if I drunk to-day

O villain thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last

all's one for that

a plague of all cowards still say I

what's the matter
what's the matter there be four of us here have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning

where is it Jack where is it

where is it taken from us it is a hundred upon poor four of us

what a hundred man

I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together I have scap'd by miracle I am eight times thrust through the doublet four through the hose my buckler out through and through my sword hacked like a hand-saw ecce signum I never dealt better since I was a man all would not do A plague of all cowards Let them speak if they speak more or less than truth they are villains and the sons of darkness

speak sirs how was it

we four set upon some dozen

sixteen at least my lord

and bound them

no no they were not bound
you rogue they were bound every man of them or I am a Jew else an Ebrew Jew

as we were sharing some six or seven fresh men set upon us

and unbound the rest and then come in the other

what fought ye with them all

all I know not what ye call all but if I fought not with fifty of them I am a bunch of radish if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack then am I no two-legged creature

pray God you have not murdered some of them

nay that's past praying for I have peppered two of them two I am sure I have paid two rogues in buckram suits I tell thee what Hal if I tell thee a lie spit in my face call me horse Thou knowest my old ward here I lay and thus I bore my point Four rogues in buckram let drive at me

what four thou saidst but two even now

four Hal I told thee four

ay ay he said four
these four came all a-front and mainly thrust at me I made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target thus

seven why there were but four even now

in buckram

ay four in buckram suits

seven by these hilts or I am a villain else

prithee let him alone we shall have more anon

dost thou hear me Hal

ay and mark thee too Jack

do so for it is worth the listening to
these nine in buckram that I told thee of


their points being broken

down fell their hose

began to give me ground but I followed me close came in foot and hand and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid

O monstrous eleven buckram men grown out of two

but as the devil would have it three misbegotten knaves in Kendal-green came at my back and let drive at me for it was so dark Hal that thou couldst not see thy hand

these lies are like the father that begets them gross as a mountain open palpable Why thou clay-brained guts thou knotty-pated fool thou whoreson obscene greasy tallowketch

what art thou mad art thou mad is not the truth the truth

why how couldst thou know these men in Kendal-green when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand come tell us your reason what sayest thou to this

come your reason Jack your reason


I'll be no longer guilty of this sin this sanguine coward this bed-presser this horseback-breaker this huge hill of flesh

'Sblood you starveling you elf-skin you dried neat's-tongue you bull's pizzle you stock-fish O for breath to utter what is like thee you tailor's yard you sheath you bow-case you vile standing-tuck

well breathe awhile and then to it again and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons hear me speak but this

mark Jack

we two saw you four set on four and you bound them and were masters of their wealth Mark now how a plain tale shall put you down Then did we two set on you four and with a word out-faced you from your prize and have it yea and can show it you here in the house And Falstaff you carried your guts away as nimbly with as quick dexterity and roared for mercy and still ran and roared as ever I heard bull-calf What a slave art thou to hack thy sword as thou hast done and then say it was in fight What trick what device what starting-hole canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame

come let's hear Jack what trick hast thou now

by the Lord I knew ye as well as he that made ye Why hear you my masters was it for me to kill the heir-apparent Should I turn upon the true prince Why thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules but beware instinct the lion will not touch the true prince Instinct is a great matter I was a coward on instinct I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life I for a valiant lion and thou for a true prince But by the Lord lads I am glad you have the money Hostess clap to the doors watch to-night pray to-morrow Gallants lads boys hearts of gold all the titles of good fellowship come to you What shall we be merry shall we have a play extempore

content and the argument shall be thy running away

Ah no more of that Hal an thou lovest me

O Jesu my lord the prince

how now my lady the hostess what sayest thou to me

marry my lord there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you he says he comes from your father

give him as much as will make him a royal man and send him back again to my mother

what manner of man is he

an old man

what doth gravity out of his bed at midnight Shall I give him his answer

prithee do Jack

faith and I'll send him packing



faith I ran when I saw others run

faith tell me now in earnest how came Falstaff's sword so hacked

why he hacked it with his dagger and said he would swear truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in fight and persuaded us to do the like

yea and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make them bleed and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men I did that I did not this seven year before I blushed to hear his monstrous devices

O villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago and wert taken with the manner and ever since thou hast blushed extempore Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side and yet thou rannest away What instinct hadst thou for it

my lord do you see these meteors do you behold these exhalations

I do

what think you they portend

hot livers and cold purses


no if rightly taken halter

here comes lean Jack here comes bare-bone How now my sweet creature of bombast How long is't ago Jack since thou sawest thine own knee

my own knee when I was about thy years Hal I was not an eagle's talon in the waist I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring A plague of sighing and grief it blows a man up like a bladder There's villanous news abroad here was Sir John Bracy from your father you must to the court in the morning That same mad fellow of the north Percy and he of Wales that gave Amaimon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook what a plague call you him

Owen Glendower

Owen Owen the same and his son-in-law Mortimer and old Northumberland and that sprightly Scot of Scots Douglas that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular

he that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying

you have hit it

so did he never the sparrow

well that rascal hath good mettle in him he will not run


o' horseback ye cuckoo but afoot he will not budge a foot

yes Jack upon instinct

I grant ye upon instinct Well he is there too and one Mordake and a thousand blue-caps more Worcester is stolen away to-night thy father's beard is turned white with the news you may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel

why then it is like if there come a hot June and this civil buffeting hold we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hob-nails by the hundreds

by the mass lad thou sayest true it is like we shall have good trading that way But tell me Hal art thou not horribly afeard thou being heir apparent could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas that spirit Percy and that devil Glendower Art thou not horribly afraid doth not thy blood thrill at it

not a whit i' faith I lack some of thy instinct

well thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to thy father if thou love me practise an answer

do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life

shall I content this chair shall be my state this dagger my sceptre and this cushion my crown


well an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee now shalt thou be moved Give me a cup of sack to make mine eyes look red that it may be thought I have wept for I must speak in passion and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein


well here is my leg


and here is my speech Stand aside nobility

O Jesu This is excellent sport i' faith

weep not sweet queen for trickling tears are vain

O the father how he holds his countenance

for God's sake lords convey my tristful queen
for tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes

O Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see
peace good pint-pot peace good tickle-brain Harry I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou art accompanied for though the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner it wears That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me If then thou be son to me here lies the point why being son to me art thou so pointed at Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries a question not to be asked Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses a question to be asked There is a thing Harry which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth the company thou keepest for Harry now I do not speak to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion not in words only but in woes also And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company but I know not his name

what manner of man an it like your majesty

a goodly portly man i' faith and a corpulent of a cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as I think his age some fifty or by'r lady inclining to threescore and now I remember me his name is Falstaff if that man should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for Harry I see virtue in his looks If then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that Falstaff him keep with the rest banish And tell me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this month

dost thou speak like a king Do thou stand for me and I'll play my father

depose me if thou dost it half so gravely so majestically both in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare

well here I am set

and here I stand Judge my masters

now Harry whence come you

my noble lord from Eastcheap

the complaints I hear of thee are grievous
'Sblood my lord they are false nay
I'll tickle ye for a young prince i' faith

swearest thou ungracious boy henceforth ne'er look on me Thou art violently carried away from grace there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of a fat old man a tun of man is thy companion Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that bolting-hutch of beastliness that swoln parcel of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed cloak-bag of guts that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in years Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous but in all things wherein worthy but in nothing

I would your Grace would take me with you whom means your Grace

that villanous abominable misleader of youth Falstaff that old white-bearded Satan

my lord the man I know

I know thou dost

but to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know That he is old the more the pity his white hairs do witness it but that he is saving your reverence a whoremaster that I utterly deny If sack and sugar be a fault God help the wicked If to be old and merry be a sin then many an old host that I know is damned if to be fat be to be hated then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved No my good lord banish Peto banish Bardolph banish Poins but for sweet Jack Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff valiant Jack Falstaff and therefore more valiant being as he is old Jack Falstaff banish not him thy Harry's company banish not him thy Harry's company banish plump Jack and banish all the world

I do I will


O my lord my lord the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door
out ye rogue Play out the play I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff


O Jesu my lord my lord

heigh heigh the devil rides upon a fiddle-stick what's the matter

the sheriff and all the watch are at the door they are come to search the house Shall I let them in

dost thou hear Hal never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit thou art essentially mad without seeming so

and thou a natural coward without instinct

I deny your major If you will deny the sheriff so if not let him enter if I become not a cart as well as another man a plague on my bringing up I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another

go hide thee behind the arras the rest walk up above Now my masters for a true face and good conscience

both which I have had but their date is out and therefore I'll hide me

call in the sheriff

now master sheriff what's your will with me

first pardon me my lord A hue and cry
hath follow'd certain men unto this house

what men

one of them is well known my gracious lord
a gross fat man

as fat as butter

the man I do assure you is not here
for I myself at this time have employ'd him
and sheriff I will engage my word to thee
that I will by to-morrow dinner-time
send him to answer thee or any man
and so let me entreat you leave the house

I will my lord There are two gentlemen
have in this robbery lost three hundred marks

it may be so if he have robb'd these men
he shall be answerable and so farewell

good night my noble lord

I think it is good morrow is it not

indeed my lord I think it be two o'clock


this oily rascal is known as well as Paul's
go call him forth

Falstaff fast asleep behind the arras and snorting like a horse
hark how hard he fetches breath
search his pockets

what hast thou found

nothing but papers my lord

let's see what they be read them


O monstrous but one half-pennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack What there is else keep close we'll read it at more advantage There let him sleep till day I'll to the court in the morning We must all to the wars and thy place shall be honourable I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot and I know his death will be a march of twelve-score The money shall be paid back again with advantage Be with me betimes in the morning and so good morrow Peto

good morrow good my lord

these promises are fair the parties sure
and our induction full of prosperous hope

lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower
will you sit down
I have forgot the map

no here it is
sit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspur
for by that name as oft as Lancaster
doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
a rising sigh he wishes you in heaven

and you in hell as often as he hears
Owen Glendower spoke of

I cannot blame him at my nativity
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
of burning cressets and at my birth
the frame and huge foundation of the earth
shak'd like a coward

why so it would have done at the same season if your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself had never been born


and I say the earth was not of my mind
if you suppose as fearing you it shook

the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble

O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
and not in fear of your nativity
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
by the imprisoning of unruly wind
within her womb which for enlargement striving
shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
steeples and moss-grown towers At your birth
our grandam earth having this distemperature
in passion shook

cousin of many men
to tell you once again that at my birth
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
the goats ran from the mountains and the herds
were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
these signs have mark'd me extraordinary
and all the courses of my life do show
I am not in the roll of common men
where is he living clipp'd in with the sea
that chides the banks of England Scotland Wales
which calls me pupil or hath read to me
and bring him out that is but woman's son
can trace me in the tedious ways of art
and hold me pace in deep experiments

I think there's no man speaks better Welsh
I'll to dinner

peace cousin Percy you will make him mad


why so can I or so can any man
but will they come when you do call for them

why I can teach thee cousin to command
the devil

and I can teach thee coz to shame the devil
by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
if thou have power to raise him bring him hither
and I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence
O while you live tell truth and shame the devil

come come
no more of this unprofitable chat

three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
against my power thrice from the banks of Wye
and sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him

home without boots and in foul weather too
how scapes he agues in the devil's name

come here's the map shall we divide our right
according to our threefold order ta'en

the archdeacon hath divided it
into three limits very equally
England from Trent and Severn hitherto
by south and east is to my part assign'd
all westward Wales beyond the Severn shore
and all the fertile land within that bound
to Owen Glendower and dear coz to you
the remnant northward lying off from Trent
and our indentures tripartite are drawn
which being sealed interchangeably
a business that this night may execute
to-morrow cousin Percy you and I
to meet your father and the Scottish power
as is appointed us at Shrewsbury
my father Glendower is not ready yet
nor shall we need his help these fourteen days


within that space you may have drawn together
your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen

a shorter time shall send me to you lords
and in my conduct shall your ladies come
from whom you now must steal and take no leave
for there will be a world of water shed
upon the parting of your wives and you

methinks my moiety north from Burton here
in quantity equals not one of yours
see how this river comes me cranking in
and cuts me from the best of all my land
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up
and here the smug and silver Trent shall run
in a new channel fair and evenly
it shall not wind with such a deep indent
to rob me of so rich a bottom here

not wind it shall it must you see it doth

yea but
mark how he bears his course and runs me up
with like advantage on the other side
gelding the opposed continent as much
as on the other side it takes from you

yea but a little charge will trench him here
and on this north side win this cape of land
and then he runs straight and even

I'll have it so a little charge will do it
I will not have it alter'd

will not you

no nor you shall not

who shall say me nay

why that will I

let me not understand you then
speak it in Welsh

I can speak English lord as well as you
for I was train'd up in the English court
where being but young I framed to the harp
many an English ditty lovely well
and gave the tongue an helpful ornament
a virtue that was never seen in you
marry and I'm glad of it with all my heart
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
than one of these same metre ballad-mongers
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd
or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree
and that would set my teeth nothing on edge
nothing so much as mincing poetry
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag

come you shall have Trent turn'd

I do not care I'll give thrice so much land
to any well-deserving friend
but in the way of bargain mark you me
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
are the indentures drawn shall we be gone

the moon shines fair you may away by night
I'll haste the writer and withal
I am afraid my daughter will run mad
so much she doteth on her Mortimer


fie cousin Percy how you cross my father

I cannot choose sometimes he angers me
with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant
of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies
and of a dragon and a finless fish
a clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven
a couching lion and a ramping cat
and such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
as puts me from my faith I'll tell thee what
he held me last night at least nine hours
in reckoning up the several devils' names
that were his lackeys I cried hum and well go to
but mark'd him not a word O he's as tedious
as a tired horse a railing wife
with cheese and garlick in a windmill far
than feed on cates and have him talk to me
in any summer-house in Christendom

in faith he is a worthy gentleman
exceedingly well read and profited
in strange concealments valiant as a lion
and wondrous affable and as bountiful
as mines of India Shall I tell you cousin
he holds your temper in a high respect
and curbs himself even of his natural scope
when you do cross his humour faith he does
I warrant you that man is not alive
might so have tempted him as you have done
without the taste of danger and reproof
but do not use it oft let me entreat you

in faith my lord you are too wilfulblame
and since your coming hither have done enough
you must needs learn lord to amend this fault
though sometimes it show greatness courage blood
and that's the dearest grace it renders you
yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
defect of manners want of government
pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
the least of which haunting a nobleman
loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
upon the beauty of all parts besides
beguiling them of commendation

well I am school'd good manners be your speed
here come our wives and let us take our leave


this is the deadly spite that angers me
my wife can speak no English I no Welsh

my daughter weeps she will not part with you

good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy
shall follow in your conduct speedily


she's desperate here a peevish self-will'd harlotry one that no persuasion can do good upon


I understand thy looks that pretty Welsh
which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
I am too perfect in and but for shame
in such a parley would I answer thee

I understand thy kisses and thou mine
and that's a feeling disputation
but I will never be a truant love
till I have learn'd thy language for thy tongue
makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd
sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower

nay if you melt then will she run mad


O I am ignorance itself in this

she bids you
upon the wanton rushes lay you down
and rest your gentle head upon her lap
and she will sing the song that pleaseth you
and on your eye-lids crown the god of sleep
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
making such difference twixt wake and sleep
as is the difference between day and night
the hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
begins his golden progress in the east

with all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing
by that time will our book I think be drawn
do so
and those musicians that shall play to you
hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
and straight they shall be here sit and attend

come Kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lap

go ye giddy goose


now I perceive the devil understands Welsh
and tis no marvel he is so humorous
by'r lady he's a good musician

then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours Lie still ye thief and hear the lady sing in Welsh

I had rather hear Lady my brach how in Irish

wouldst thou have thy head broken
no

then be still

neither tis a woman's fault

now God help thee

to the Welsh lady's bed

what's that

peace she sings


come Kate I'll have your song too

not mine in good sooth

and giv'st such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
as if thou never walk'dst further than Finsbury
swear me Kate like a lady as thou art
a good mouth-filling oath and leave in sooth
and such protest of pepper-gingerbread
to velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens
come sing

I will not sing

'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be red-breast teacher An the indentures be drawn I'll away within these two hours and so come in when ye will


come come Lord Mortimer you are as slow
as hot Lord Percy is on fire to go
by this our book is drawn we will but seal
and then to horse immediately

with all my heart

lords give us leave the Prince of Wales and I
must have some private conference but be near at hand
for we shall presently have need of you

I know not whether God will have it so
for some displeasing service I have done
that in his secret doom out of my blood
he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me
but thou dost in thy passages of life
make me believe that thou art only mark'd
for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
to punish my mistreadings Tell me else
could such inordinate and low desires
such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
such barren pleasures rude society
as thou art match'd withal and grafted to
accompany the greatness of thy blood
and hold their level with thy princely heart
so please your majesty I would I could
quit all offences with as clear excuse
as well as I am doubtless I can purge
myself of many I am charg'd withal
yet such extenuation let me beg
as in reproof of many tales devis'd
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
by smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers
I may for some things true wherein my youth
hath faulty wander'd and irregular
find pardon on my true submission

God pardon thee yet let me wonder Harry
at thy affections which do hold a wing
quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
which by thy younger brother is supplied
and art almost an alien to the hearts
of all the court and princes of my blood
is ruin'd and the soul of every man
prophetically do forethink thy fall
had I so lavish of my presence been
so common-hackney'd in the eyes of men
so stale and cheap to vulgar company
opinion that did help me to the crown
had still kept loyal to possession
and left me in reputeless banishment
a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
by being seldom seen I could not stir
but like a comet I was wonder'd at
that men would tell their children This is he
others would say Where which is Bolingbroke
and then I stole all courtesy from heaven
and dress'd myself in such humility
that I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts
loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
even in the presence of the crowned king
thus did I keep my person fresh and new
ne'er seen but wonder'd at and so my state
seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
and won by rareness such solemnity
the skipping king he ambled up and down
with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
mingled his royalty with capering fools
had his great name profaned with their scorns
and gave his countenance against his name
to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
of every beardless vain comparative
grew a companion to the common streets
enfeoff'd himself to popularity
that being daily swallow'd by men's eyes
they surfeited with honey and began
to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
more than a little is by much too much
so when he had occasion to be seen
he was but as the cuckoo is in June
as sick and blunted with community
afford no extraordinary gaze
such as is bent on sun-like majesty
when it shines seldom in admiring eyes
but rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down
slept in his face and render'd such aspect
as cloudy men use to their adversaries
being with his presence glutted gorg'd and full
and in that very line Harry stand'st thou
for thou hast lost thy princely privilege
with vile participation not an eye
but is aweary of thy common sight
save mine which hath desir'd to see thee more
which now doth that I would not have it do
make blind itself with foolish tenderness

I shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
be more myself

as thou art to this hour was Richard then
when I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh
and even as I was then is Percy now
now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
he hath more worthy interest to the state
than thou the shadow of succession
for of no right nor colour like to right
he doth fill fields with harness in the realm
turns head against the lion's armed jaws
and being no more in debt to years than thou
leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
to bloody battles and to bruising arms
what never-dying honour hath he got
against renowned Douglas whose high deeds
whose hot incursions and great name in arms
holds from all soldiers chief majority
and military title capital
through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ
thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothes
discomfited great Douglas ta'en him once
enlarged him and made a friend of him
to fill the mouth of deep defiance up
and shake the peace and safety of our throne
and what say you to this Percy Northumberland
the Archbishop's Grace of York Douglas Mortimer
capitulate against us and are up
but wherefore do I tell these news to thee
why Harry do I tell thee of my foes
which art my near'st and dearest enemy
thou that art like enough through vassal fear
base inclination and the start of spleen
to fight against me under Percy's pay
to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
to show how much thou art degenerate

do not think so you shall not find it so
and God forgive them that so much have sway'd
your majesty's good thoughts away from me
and in the closing of some glorious day
be bold to tell you that I am your son
when I will wear a garment all of blood
and stain my favours in a bloody mask
which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it
and that shall be the day whene'er it lights
that this same child of honour and renown
this gallant Hotspur this all-praised knight
and your unthought of Harry chance to meet
for every honour sitting on his helm
would they were multitudes and on my head
my shames redoubled for the time will come
that I shall make this northern youth exchange
his glorious deeds for my indignities
Percy is but my factor good my lord
to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
and I will call him to so strict account
that he shall render every glory up
yea even the slightest worship of his time
this in the name of God I promise here
the which if he be pleas'd I shall perform
I do beseech your majesty may salve
the long-grown wounds of my intemperance
if not the end of life cancels all bands
and I will die a hundred thousand deaths
ere break the smallest parcel of this vow

a hundred thousand rebels die in this
thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein

how now good Blunt thy looks are full of speed

so hath the business that I come to speak of
lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
that Douglas and the English rebels met
the eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
a mighty and a fearful head they are
if promises be kept on every hand

the Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day
with him my son Lord John of Lancaster
for this advertisement is five days old
on Wednesday next Harry you shall set forward
on Thursday we ourselves will march our meeting
is Bridgenorth and Harry you shall march
through Gloucestershire by which account
our business valued some twelve days hence
our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet
our hands are full of business let's away
advantage feeds him fat while men delay


Bardolph am I not fallen away vilely since this last action do I not bate do I not dwindle Why my skin hangs about me like an old lady's loose gown I am withered like an old apple-john Well I'll repent and that suddenly while I am in some liking I shall be out of heart shortly and then I shall have no strength to repent An I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of I am a peppercorn a brewer's horse the inside of a church Company villanous company hath been the spoil of me

sir John you are so fretful you cannot live long

why there is it come sing me a bawdy song make me merry I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be virtuous enough swore little diced not above seven times a week went to a bawdy-house not above once in a quarter of an hour paid money that I borrowed three or four times lived well and in good compass and now I live out of all order out of all compass
why you are so fat Sir John that you must needs be out of all compass out of all reasonable compass Sir John

do thou amend thy face and I'll amend my life thou art our admiral thou bearest the lanthorn in the poop but tis in the nose of thee thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp

why Sir John my face does you no harm

no I'll be sworn I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a Death's head or a memento mori I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and Dives that lived in purple for there he is in his robes burning burning If thou wert any way given to virtue I would swear by thy face my oath should be By this fire that's God's angel but thou art altogether given over and wert indeed but for the light in thy face the son of utter darkness When thou rannest up Gadshill in the night to catch my horse if I did not think thou hadst been an igius fatuus or a ball of wildfire there's no purchase in money O thou art a perpetual triumph an everlasting bonfire-light Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler's in Europe I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two-and-thirty years God reward me for it

'Sblood I would my face were in your belly

God-a-mercy so should I be sure to be heart-burned

how now Dame Partlet the hen have you inquired yet who picked my pocket

why Sir John what do you think Sir John Do you think I keep thieves in my house I have searched I have inquired so has my husband man by man boy by boy servant by servant the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before

you lie hostess Bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked Go to you are a woman go

who I No I defy thee God's light

go to I know you well enough

no Sir John you do not know me Sir John I know you Sir John you owe me money Sir John and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back

dowlas filthy dowlas I have given them away to bakers' wives and they have made bolters of them

now as I am true woman holland of eight shillings an ell You owe money here besides Sir John for your diet and by-drinkings and money lent you four-and-twenty pound

he had his part of it let him pay

he alas he is poor he hath nothing

how poor look upon his face what call you rich let them coin his nose let them coin his cheeks I'll not pay a denier What will you make a younker of me shall I not take mine ease in mine inn but I shall have my pocket picked I have lost a seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark

O Jesu I have heard the prince tell him I know not how oft that that ring was copper

how the prince is a Jack a sneak-cup sblood an he were here I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so

how now lad is the wind in that door i' faith must we all march

yea two and two Newgate fashion

my lord I pray you hear me

what sayest thou Mistress Quickly
how does thy husband I love him well he is an honest man

good my lord hear me

prithee let her alone and list to me

what sayest thou Jack

the other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and had my pocket picked this house is turned bawdy-house they pick pockets

what didst thou lose Jack


a trifle some eight-penny matter

so I told him my lord and I said I heard your Grace say so and my lord he speaks most vilely of you like a foul-mouthed man as he is and said he would cudgel you

what he did not

there's neither faith truth nor womanhood in me else

there's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox and for womanhood Maid Marian may be the deputy's wife of the ward to thee Go you thing go

say what thing what thing

what thing why a thing to thank God on

I am no thing to thank God on I would thou shouldst know it I am an honest man's wife and setting thy knighthood aside thou art a knave to call me so

setting thy womanhood aside thou art a beast to say otherwise


what beast why an otter

an otter Sir John why an otter

why she's neither fish nor flesh a man knows not where to have her

thou art an unjust man in saying so thou or any man knows where to have me thou knave thou

thou sayest true hostess and he slanders thee most grossly

so he doth you my lord and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound

sirrah do I owe you a thousand pound

a thousand pound Hal a million thy love is worth a million thou owest me thy love

nay my lord he called you Jack and said he would cudgel you


indeed Sir John you said so

yea if he said my ring was copper

I say tis copper darest thou be as good as thy word now

why Hal thou knowest as thou art but man I dare but as thou art prince I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion s whelp

and why not as the lion

the king himself is to be feared as the lion dost thou think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father nay an I do I pray God my girdle break

O if it should how would thy guts fall about thy knees But sirrah there's no room for faith truth or honesty in this bosom of thine it is all filled up with guts and midriff Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket Why thou whoreson impudent embossed rascal if there were any thing in thy pocket but tavern reckonings memorandums of bawdy-houses and one poor pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these I am a villain And yet you will stand to it you will not pocket up wrong Art thou not ashamed

dost thou hear Hal thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villany Thou seest I have more flesh than another man and therefore more frailty You confess then you picked my pocket

it appears so by the story


now Hal to the news at court for the robbery lad how is that answered

O my sweet beef I must still be good angel to thee the money is paid back again

O I do not like that paying back tis a double labour

I am good friends with my father and may do anything

rob me the exchequer the first thing thou dost and do it with unwashed hands too

do my lord

I have procured thee Jack a charge of foot

I would it had been of horse Where shall I find one that can steal well O for a fine thief of the age of two-and-twenty or thereabouts I am heinously unprovided Well God be thanked for these rebels they offend none but the virtuous I laud them I praise them

Bardolph


go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster
to my brother John this to my Lord of Westmoreland
go Poins to horse to horse for thou and I
have thirty miles to ride ere dinner-time
Jack meet me to-morrow in the Temple-hall
at two o'clock in the afternoon
there shalt thou know thy charge and there receive
money and order for their furniture
the land is burning Percy stands on high
and either we or they must lower lie


rare words brave world Hostess my breakfast come
O I could wish this tavern were my drum

well said my noble Scot if speaking truth
in this fine age were not thought flattery
such attribution should the Douglas have
should go so general current through the world
by God I cannot flatter do defy
the tongues of soothers but a braver place
in my heart's love hath no man than yourself
nay task me to my word approve me lord

thou art the king of honour
no man so potent breathes upon the ground
but I will beard him

do so and tis well


what letters hast thou there


I can but thank you

these letters come from your father
letters from him why comes he not himself

he cannot come my lord he's grievous sick

'Zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
in such a justling time Who leads his power
under whose government come they along

his letters bear his mind not I my lord

I prithee tell me doth he keep his bed

he did my lord four days ere I set forth
and at the time of my departure thence
he was much fear'd by his physicians

I would the state of time had first been whole
ere he by sickness had been visited
his health was never better worth than now
sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
the very life-blood of our enterprise
'Tis catching hither even to our camp
he writes me here that inward sickness
and that his friends by deputation could not
so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet
to lay so dangerous and dear a trust
on any soul remov'd but on his own
yet doth he give us bold advertisement
that with our small conjunction we should on
to see how fortune is dispos'd to us
for as he writes there is no quailing now
because the king is certainly possess'd
of all our purposes What say you to it

your father's sickness is a maim to us

a perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off
and yet in faith tis not his present want
to set the exact wealth of all our states
all at one cast to set so rich a main
on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
it were not good for therein should we read
the very bottom and the soul of hope
the very list the very utmost bound
of all our fortunes

faith and so we should
where now remains a sweet reversion
we may boldly spend upon the hope of what
is to come in
a comfort of retirement lives in this

a rendezvous a home to fly unto
if that the devil and mischance look big
upon the maidenhead of our affairs

but yet I would your father had been here
brooks no division It will be thought
by some that know not why he is away
that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
and think how such an apprehension
may turn the tide of fearful faction
and breed a kind of question in our cause
for well you know we of the offering side
must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
and stop all sight-holes every loop from whence
the eye of reason may pry in upon us
this absence of your father's draws a curtain
that shows the ignorant a kind of fear
before not dreamt of

you strain too far
I rather of his absence make this use
it lends a lustre and more great opinion
a larger dare to our great enterprise
if we without his help can make a head
to push against the kingdom with his help
we shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down
yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole

as heart can think there is not such a word
spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear


my cousin Vernon welcome by my soul

pray God my news be worth a welcome lord
the Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong
is marching hitherwards with him Prince John

no harm what more

and further I have learn'd
the king himself in person is set forth
with strong and mighty preparation

he shall be welcome too Where is his son
the nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales
and his comrades that daff'd the world aside
and bid it pass

all furnish'd all in arms
all plum'd like estridges that wing the wind
baited like eagles having lately bath'd
glittering in golden coats like images
as full of spirit as the month of May
and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
I saw young Harry with his beaver on
his cushes on his thighs gallantly arm'd
rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury
and vaulted with such ease into his seat
as if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds
and witch the world with noble horsemanship

no more no more worse than the sun in March
this praise doth nourish agues Let them come
they come like sacrifices in their trim
and to the fire-ey'd maid of smoky war
all hot and bleeding will we offer them
the mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
up to the ears in blood I am on fire
to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
and yet not ours Come let me taste my horse
who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
against the bosom of the Prince of Wales
Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse
meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse
O that Glendower were come

there is more news
I learn'd in Worcester as I rode along

that's the worst tidings that I hear of yet

ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound

what may the king's whole battle reach unto

to thirty thousand

forty let it be
my father and Glendower being both away
the powers of us may serve so great a day
come let us take a muster speedily
doomsday is near die all die merrily

talk not of dying I am out of fear
of death or death's hand for this one half year



will you give me money captain

lay out lay out

this bottle makes an angel

an if it do take it for thy labour and if it make twenty take them all I'll answer the coinage Bid my Lieutenant Peto meet me at the town's end

I will captain farewell


if I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a soused gurnet I have misused the king's press damnably I have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers three hundred and odd pounds I press me none but good householders yeomen's sons inquire me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild-duck I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins' heads and they have bought out their services and now my whole charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth where the glutton's dogs licked his sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust serving-men younger sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen the cankers of a calm world and a long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping from eating draff and husks A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies No eye hath seen such scarecrows I'll not march through Coventry with them that's flat nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed I had the most of them out of prison There's but a shirt and a half in all my company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth stolen from my host at Saint Alban's or the red-nose inn-keeper of Daventry But that's all one they'll find linen enough on every hedge


how now blown Jack how now quilt

what Hal How now mad wag what a devil dost thou in Warwickshire My good Lord of Westmoreland I cry you mercy I thought your honour had already been at Shrewsbury


tut never fear me I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream

I think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already made thee butter But tell me Jack whose fellows are these that come after

mine Hal mine

I did never see such pitiful rascals

tut tut good enough to toss food for powder food for powder they'll fill a pit as well as better tush man mortal men mortal men

ay but Sir John methinks they are exceeding poor and bare too beggarly

faith for their poverty I know not where they had that and for their bareness I am sure they never learned that of me

no I'll be sworn unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare But sirrah make haste Percy is already in the field

what is the king encamped


well
to the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
fits a dull fighter and a keen guest


we'll fight with him to-night

it may not be

you give him then advantage

not a whit

why say you so looks he not for supply

so do we

his is certain ours is doubtful
good cousin be advis'd stir not to-night

do not my lord

you do not counsel well
you speak it out of fear and cold heart

do me no slander Douglas by my life
and I dare well maintain it with my life
if well-respected honour bid me on
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
as you my lord or any Scot that this day lives
let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
which of us fears

yea or to-night

content


come come it may not be I wonder much
being men of such great leading as you are
that you foresee not what impediments
drag back our expedition certain horse
of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up
your uncle Worcester's horse came but to-day
and now their pride and mettle is asleep
their courage with hard labour tame and dull
that not a horse is half the half of himself

so are the horses of the enemy
in general journey-bated and brought low
the better part of ours are full of rest

the number of the king exceedeth ours
for God's sake cousin stay till all come in

I come with gracious offers from the king

welcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God
you were of our determination
some of us love you well and even those some
envy your great deservings and good name
because you are not of our quality
but stand against us like an enemy

and God defend but still I should stand so
so long as out of limit and true rule
you stand against anointed majesty
but to my charge The king hath sent to know
the nature of your griefs and whereupon
you conjure from the breast of civil peace
such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
audacious cruelty If that the king
have any way your good deserts forgot
which he confesseth to be manifold
he bids you name your griefs and with all speed
and pardon absolute for yourself and these
herein misled by your suggestion

the king is kind and well we know the king
knows at what time to promise when to pay
my father and my uncle and myself
did give him that same royalty he wears
and when he was not six-and-twenty strong
sick in the world's regard wretched and low
a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
my father gave him welcome to the shore
and when he heard him swear and vow to God
he came but to be Duke of Lancaster
to sue his livery and beg his peace
with tears of innocency and terms of zeal
my father in kind heart and pity mov'd
swore him assistance and perform'd it too
now when the lords and barons of the realm
perceiv'd Northumberland did lean to him
met him in boroughs cities villages
attended him on bridges stood in lanes
laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths
gave him their heirs as pages follow'd him
even at the heels in golden multitudes
he presently as greatness knows itself
steps me a little higher than his vow
made to my father while his blood was poor
upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh
and now forsooth takes on him to reform
some certain edicts and some strait decrees
that lie too heavy on the commonwealth
cries out upon abuses seems to weep
over his country's wrongs and by this face
this seeming brow of justice did he win
the hearts of all that he did angle for
proceeded further cut me off the heads
of all the favourites that the absent king
in deputation left behind him here

tut I came not to hear this

then to the point
in short time after he depos'd the king
soon after that depriv'd him of his life
and in the neck of that task'd the whole state
to make that worse suffer'd his kinsman March
who is if every owner were well plac'd
indeed his king to be engag'd in Wales
there without ransom to lie forfeited
disgrac'd me in my happy victories
sought to entrap me by intelligence
rated my uncle from the council-board
in rage dismiss'd my father from the court
broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
and in conclusion drove us to seek out
this head of safety and withal to pry
into his title the which we find

shall I return this answer to the king

not so Sir Walter we'll withdraw awhile
go to the king and let there be impawn'd
some surety for a safe return again
and in the morning early shall my uncle
bring him our purposes and so farewell

I would you would accept of grace and love

and may be so we shall

pray God you do


hie good Sir Michael bear this sealed brief
with winged haste to the lord marshal
this to my cousin Scroop and all the rest
how much they do import you would make haste

my good lord
I guess their tenour

like enough you do
to-morrow good Sir Michael is a day
wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury
as I am truly given to understand
the king with mighty and quick-raised power
meets with Lord Harry and I fear Sir Michael
what with the sickness of Northumberland
whose power was in the first proportion
and what with Owen Glendower's absence thence
who with them was a rated sinew too
and comes not in o'er-rul'd by prophecies
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
to wage an instant trial with the king
why my good lord you need not fear
there is the Douglas and Lord Mortimer

no Mortimer is not there

but there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy
and there's my Lord of Worcester and a head
of gallant warriors noble gentlemen

and so there is but yet the king hath drawn
the special head of all the land together
the Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster
the noble Westmoreland and war-like Blunt
and many moe corrivals and dear men
of estimation and command in arms

doubt not my lord they shall be well oppos'd

I hope no less yet needful tis to fear
for if Lord Percy thrive not ere the king
dismiss his power he means to visit us
for he hath heard of our confederacy
and tis but wisdom to make strong against him
therefore make haste I must go write again
to other friends and so farewell Sir Michael

how bloodily the sun begins to peer
above yon busky hill the day looks pale
at his distemperature

the southern wind
doth play the trumpet to his purposes
and by his hollow whistling in the leaves
foretells a tempest and a blustering day

then with the losers let it sympathize
for nothing can seem foul to those that win

that you and I should meet upon such terms
as now we meet You have deceiv'd our trust
and made us doff our easy robes of peace
to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
this is not well my lord this is not well
what say you to it will you again unknit
this churlish knot of all-abhorred war
and move in that obedient orb again
where you did give a fair and natural light
and be no more an exhal'd meteor
a prodigy of fear and a portent

of broached mischief to the unborn times

hear me my liege
for mine own part I could be well content
to entertain the lag-end of my life
with quiet hours for I do protest
I have not sought the day of this dislike
you have not sought it how comes it then

rebellion lay in his way and he found it

peace chewet peace

it pleas'd your majesty to turn your looks
of favour from myself and all our house
and yet I must remember you my lord
we were the first and dearest of your friends
for you my staff of office did I break
in Richard's time and posted day and night
to meet you on the way and kiss your hand
when yet you were in place and in account
nothing so strong and fortunate as I
it was myself my brother and his son
that brought you home and boldly did outdare
the dangers of the time You swore to us
and you did swear that oath at Doncaster
nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right
the seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster
to this we swore our aid but in short space
it rain'd down fortune showering on your head
and such a flood of greatness fell on you
what with our help what with the absent king
what with the injuries of a wanton time
the seeming sufferances that you had borne
and the contrarious winds that held the king
so long in his unlucky Irish wars
that all in England did repute him dead
and from this swarm of fair advantages
you took occasion to be quickly woo'd
to gripe the general sway into your hand
forgot your oath to us at Doncaster
and being fed by us you us'd us so
as that ungentle gull the cuckoo's bird
useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
we were enforc'd for safety's sake to fly
out of your sight and raise this present head
whereby we stand opposed by such means
as you yourself have forg'd against yourself
by unkind usage dangerous countenance
and violation of all faith and troth
sworn to us in your younger enterprise

these things indeed you have articulate
proclaim'd at market-crosses read in churches
to face the garment of rebellion
with some fine colour that may please the eye
of fickle changelings and poor discontents
which gape and rub the elbow at the news
of hurlyburly innovation
and never yet did insurrection want
such water-colours to impaint his cause
nor moody beggars starving for a time

in both our armies there is many a soul
shall pay full dearly for this encounter
if once they join in trial Tell your nephew
the Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
in praise of Henry Percy by my hopes
this present enterprise set off his head
I do not think a braver gentleman
more active-valiant or more valiant-young
more daring or more bold is now alive
to grace this latter age with noble deeds
for my part I may speak it to my shame
I have a truant been to chivalry
and so I hear he doth account me too
yet this before my father's majesty
I am content that he shall take the odds
of his great name and estimation
and will to save the blood on either side
try fortune with him in a single fight
and Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee
albeit considerations infinite
do make against it No good Worcester no
we love our people well even those we love
that are misled upon your cousin's part
and will they take the offer of our grace
both he and they and you yea every man
shall be my friend again and I'll be his
so tell your cousin and bring me word
what he will do but if he will not yield
rebuke and dread correction wait on us
and they shall do their office So be gone
we will not now be troubled with reply
we offer fair take it advisedly


it will not be accepted on my life
the Douglas and the Hotspur both together
are confident against the world in arms
hence therefore every leader to his charge
for on their answer will we set on them
and God befriend us as our cause is just


Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so tis a point of friendship

nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship Say thy prayers and farewell

I would it were bed-time Hal and all well

why thou owest God a death


'Tis not due yet I would be loath to pay him before his day What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me Well tis no matter honour pricks me on Yea but how if honour prick me off when I come on how then Can honour set to a leg No Or an arm No Or take away the grief of a wound No Honour hath no skill in surgery then No What is honour a word What is that word honour Air A trim reckoning Who hath it he that died o' Wednesday Doth he feel it No Doth he hear it No It is insensible then Yea to the dead But will it not live with the living No Why Detraction will not suffer it Therefore I'll none of it honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism


O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard
the liberal kind offer of the king
'Twere best he did

then are we all undone
it is not possible it cannot be
the king should keep his word in loving us
he will suspect us still and find a time
to punish this offence in other faults
suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
for treason is but trusted like the fox
who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up
will have a wild trick of his ancestors
look how we can or sad or merrily
interpretation will misquote our looks
and we shall feed like oxen at a stall
the better cherish'd still the nearer death
my nephew's trespass may be well forgot
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
and an adopted name of privilege
a hare-brain'd Hotspur govern'd by a spleen
and on his father's we did train him on
and his corruption being ta'en from us
we as the spring of all shall pay for all
therefore good cousin let not Harry know
in any case the offer of the king

deliver what you will I'll say tis so
here comes your cousin


my uncle is return'd deliver up
my Lord of Westmoreland Uncle what news

the king will bid you battle presently

defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland

lord Douglas go you and tell him so



there is no seeming mercy in the king

did you beg any God forbid

I told him gently of our grievances
of his oath-breaking which he mended thus
by now forswearing that he is forsworn
he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge
with haughty arms this hateful name in us


arm gentlemen to arms for I have thrown
a brave defiance in King Henry's teeth
and Westmoreland that was engag'd did bear it
which cannot choose but bring him quickly on

the Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king

O would the quarrel lay upon our heads
and that no man might draw short breath to-day
but I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me
how show'd his tasking seem'd it in contempt

no by my soul I never in my life
did hear a challenge urg'd more modestly
unless a brother should a brother dare
to gentle exercise and proof of arms
he gave you all the duties of a man
trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
spoke your deservings like a chronicle
making you ever better than his praise
by still dispraising praise valu'd with you
and which became him like a prince indeed
he made a blushing cital of himself
and chid his truant youth with such a grace
as if he master'd there a double spirit
there did he pause But let me tell the world
if he outlive the envy of this day
England did never owe so sweet a hope
so much misconstru'd in his wantonness

cousin I think thou art enamoured
on his follies never did I hear
of any prince so wild a libertine
but be he as he will yet once ere night
I will embrace him with a soldier's arm
that he shall shrink under my courtesy
arm arm with speed And fellows soldiers friends
better consider what you have to do
than I that have not well the gift of tongue
can lift your blood up with persuasion


my lord here are letters for you

O gentlemen the time of life is short
to spend that shortness basely were too long
if life did ride upon a dial's point
still ending at the arrival of an hour
an if we live we live to tread on kings
if die brave death when princes die with us
now for our consciences the arms are fair
when the intent of bearing them is just


my lord prepare the king comes on apace

I thank him that he cuts me from my tale
for I profess not talking Only this
let each man do his best and here draw I
a sword whose temper I intend to stain
with the best blood that I can meet withal
in the adventure of this perilous day
now Esperance Percy and set on
and by that music let us all embrace
for heaven to earth some of us never shall
a second time do such a courtesy

what is thy name that in the battle thus
thou crossest me what honour dost thou seek
upon my head

know then my name is Douglas
and I do haunt thee in the battle thus
because some tell me that thou art a king

they tell thee true

the Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
thy likeness for instead of thee King Harry
this sword hath ended him so shall it thee
unless thou yield thee as my prisoner

and thou shalt find a king that will revenge
lord Stafford's death

O Douglas hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus
I never had triumph'd upon a Scot

all's done all's won here breathless lies the king

where

here

this Douglas no I know this face full well
a gallant knight he was his name was Blunt
semblably furnish'd like the king himself

a fool go with thy soul whither it goes
a borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear
why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king
the king hath many marching in his coats

now by my sword I will kill all his coats
I'll murder all his wardrobe piece by piece
until I meet the king

up and away
our soldiers stand full fairly for the day

though I could scape shot-free at London I fear the shot here here's no scoring but upon the pate Soft who art thou Sir Walter Blunt there's honour for you here's no vanity I am as hot as molten lead and as heavy too God keep lead out of me I need no more weight than mine own bowels I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered there's not three of my hundred and fifty left alive and they are for the town's end to beg during life But who comes here


what stand'st thou idle here lend me thy sword
many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
under the hoofs of vaunting enemies
whose deaths are unreveng'd prithee lend me thy sword

O Hal I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day I have paid Percy I have made him sure

I prithee lend me thy sword

nay before God Hal if Percy be alive thou gett'st not my sword but take my pistol if thou wilt

give it me What is it in the case

ay Hal tis hot tis hot there's that will sack a city


what is't a time to jest and dally now


well if Percy be alive I'll pierce him If he do come in my way so if he do not if I come in his willingly let him make a carbonado of me I like not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath give me life which if I can save so if not honour comes unlooked for and there's an end


I prithee
Harry withdraw thyself thou bleed'st too much
lord John of Lancaster go you with him


I beseech your majesty make up
lest your retirement do amaze your friends

I will do so
my Lord of Westmoreland lead him to his tent

come my lord I'll lead you to your tent

lead me my lord I do not need your help
and God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
the Prince of Wales from such a field as this
where stain'd nobility lies trodden on
and rebels' arms triumph in massacres

we breathe too long come cousin Westmoreland
our duty this way lies for God's sake come


I did not think thee lord of such a spirit
before I lov'd thee as a brother John
but now I do respect thee as my soul

I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
with lustier maintenance than I did look for
of such an ungrown warrior

O this boy
lends mettle to us all

another king they grow like Hydra's heads
I am the Douglas fatal to all those
that wear those colours on them what art thou
that counterfeit'st the person of a king

the king himself who Douglas grieves at heart
so many of his shadows thou hast met
and not the very king I have two boys
but seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily
I will assay thee so defend thyself

I fear thou art another counterfeit
and yet in faith thou bear'st thee like a king
but mine I am sure thou art whoe'er thou be
and thus I win thee


hold up thy head vile Scot or thou art like
never to hold it up again the spirits
of valiant Shirley Stafford Blunt are in my arms
it is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee
who never promiseth but he means to pay

cheerly my lord how fares your Grace
sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent
and so hath Clifton I'll to Clifton straight

thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion
and show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life
in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me

O God they did me too much injury
that ever said I hearken'd for your death
if it were so I might have let alone
the insulting hand of Douglas over you
which would have been as speedy in your end
as all the poisonous potions in the world
and sav'd the treacherous labour of your son

make up to Clifton I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey

if I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouth

thou speak'st as if I would deny my name

my name is Harry Percy
why then I see
a very valiant rebel of that name
I am the Prince of Wales and think not Percy
to share with me in glory any more
two stars keep not their motion in one sphere
nor can one England brook a double reign
of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales

nor shall it Harry for the hour is come
to end the one of us and would to God
thy name in arms were now as great as mine

I'll make it greater ere I part from thee
and all the budding honours on thy crest
I'll crop to make a garland for my head

I can no longer brook thy vanities

well said Hal to it Hal Nay you shall find no boy's play here I can tell you
O Harry thou hast robb'd me of my youth
I better brook the loss of brittle life
than those proud titles thou hast won of me
they wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh
but thought's the slave of life and life time's fool
and time that takes survey of all the world
must have a stop O I could prophesy
but that the earthy and cold hand of death
lies on my tongue No Percy thou art dust
and food for


for worms brave Percy Fare thee well great heart
ill-weav'd ambition how much art thou shrunk
when that this body did contain a spirit
a kingdom for it was too small a bound
but now two paces of the vilest earth
is room enough this earth that bears thee dead
bears not alive so stout a gentleman
I should not make so dear a show of zeal
but let my favours hide thy mangled face
and even in thy behalf I'll thank myself
for doing these fair rites of tenderness
adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
thy ignomy sleep with thee in the grave
but not remember'd in thy epitaph

what old acquaintance could not all this flesh
keep in a little life Poor Jack farewell
I could have better spar'd a better man
O I should have a heavy miss of thee
if I were much in love with vanity
death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day
though many dearer in this bloody fray
embowell'd will I see thee by and by
till then in blood by noble Percy lie



come brother John full bravely hast thou flesh'd
thy maiden sword

but soft whom have we here
did you not tell me this fat man was dead

I did I saw him dead
breathless and bleeding on the ground
art thou alive or is it fantasy
that plays upon our eyesight I prithee speak
we will not trust our eyes without our ears
thou art not what thou seem'st

no that's certain I am not a double man but if I be not Jack Falstaff then am I a Jack There is Percy

: if your father will do me any honour so if not let him kill the next Percy himself I look to be either earl or duke I can assure you

why Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead
didst thou Lord Lord how this world is given to lying I grant you I was down and out of breath and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock If I may be believed so if not let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads I'll take it upon my death I gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were alive and would deny it zounds I would make him eat a piece of my sword

this is the strangest tale that e'er I heard

this is the strangest fellow brother John
come bring your luggage nobly on your back
for my part if a lie may do thee grace
I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have

the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
come brother let us to the highest of the field
to see what friends are living who are dead


I'll follow as they say for reward He that rewards me God reward him If I do grow great I'll grow less for I'll purge and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should do

thus ever did rebellion find rebuke
ill-spirited Worcester did we not send grace
pardon and terms of love to all of you
misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust
three knights upon our party slain to-day
a noble earl and many a creature else
had been alive this hour
if like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
betwixt our armies true intelligence

what I have done my safety urg'd me to
and I embrace this fortune patiently
since not to be avoided it falls on me

bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too
other offenders we will pause upon

how goes the field

the noble Scot Lord Douglas when he saw
the fortune of the day quite turn'd from him
the noble Percy slain and all his men
and falling from a hill he was so bruis'd
that the pursuers took him At my tent
the Douglas is and I beseech your Grace
I may dispose of him

with all my heart

then brother John of Lancaster to you
this honourable bounty shall belong
go to the Douglas and deliver him
up to his pleasure ransomless and free
his valour shown upon our crests to-day
hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
even in the bosom of our adversaries

I thank your Grace for this high courtesy
which I shall give away immediately

then this remains that we divide our power
towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed
to meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop
who as we hear are busily in arms
myself and you son Harry will towards Wales
to fight with Glendower and the Earl of March
rebellion in this land shall lose his sway
meeting the check of such another day
and since this business so fair is done
let us not leave till all our own be won

THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY VI

fiends appearing to La Pucelle


hung be the heavens with black yield day to night
comets importing change of times and states
brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
and with them scourge the bad revolting stars
king Henry the Fifth too famous to live long
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth

England ne'er had a king until his time
virtue he had deserving to command
his brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams
his arms spread wider than a dragon's wings
his sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire
more dazzled and drove back his enemies
than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces
what should I say his deeds exceed all speech
he ne'er lift up his hand but conquered

we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
Henry is dead and never shall revive
upon a wooden coffin we attend
and death's dishonourable victory
we with our stately presence glorify
like captives bound to a triumphant car
that plotted thus our glory's overthrow
or shall we think the subtle-witted French
conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
by magic verses have contriv'd his end

he was a king bless'd of the King of kings
unto the French the dreadful judgment-day
so dreadful will not be as was his sight
the battles of the Lord of hosts he fought
the church's prayers made him so prosperous

the church where is it Had not churchmen pray'd
his thread of life had not so soon decay'd
none do you like but an effeminate prince
whom like a school-boy you may over-awe

Gloucester whate'er we like thou art protector
and lookest to command the prince and realm
thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe

name not religion for thou lov'st the flesh
and ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
except it be to pray against thy foes

cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
let's to the altar heralds wait on us
instead of gold we'll offer up our arms
since arms avail not now that Henry's dead
posterity await for wretched years
when at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck
our isle be made a marish of salt tears
and none but women left to wail the dead
Henry the Fifth thy ghost I invocate
prosper this realm keep it from civil broils
combat with adverse planets in the heavens
a far more glorious star thy soul will make
than Julius C sar or bright

my honourable lords health to you all
sad tidings bring I to you out of France
of loss of slaughter and discomfiture
guienne Champaigne Rheims Orleans
Paris Guysors Poictiers are all quite lost

what sayst thou man before dead Henry's corse
speak softly or the loss of those great towns
will make him burst his lead and rise from death

is Paris lost is Roan yielded up
if Henry were recall'd to life again
these news would cause him once more yield the ghost

how were they lost what treachery was us'd

no treachery but want of men and money
among the soldiers this is muttered
that here you maintain several factions
you are disputing of your generals
one would have lingering wars with little cost
another would fly swift but wanteth wings
a third thinks without expense at all
by guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd
awake awake English nobility
let not sloth dim your honours new-begot
cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms
of England's coat one half is cut away

were our tears wanting to this funeral
these tidings would call forth their flowing tides

me they concern Regent I am of France
give me my steeled coat I'll fight for France
away with these disgraceful wailing robes
wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes
to weep their intermissive miseries

lords view these letters full of bad mischance
France is revolted from the English quite
except some petty towns of no import
the Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims
the Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd
Reignier Duke of Anjou doth take his part
the Duke of Alen on flieth to his side

the Dauphin crowned king all fly to him
O whither shall we fly from this reproach

we will not fly but to our enemies' throats
Bedford if thou be slack I'll fight it out

Gloucester why doubt'st thou of my forwardness
an army have I muster'd in my thoughts
wherewith already France is overrun


wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse
I must inform you of a dismal fight
betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French

what wherein Talbot overcame is't so

O no wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown
the circumstance I'll tell you more at large
the tenth of August last this dreadful lord
retiring from the siege of Orleans
having full scarce six thousand in his troop
by three-and-twenty thousand of the French
was round encompassed and set upon
no leisure had he to enrank his men
he wanted pikes to set before his archers
instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
they pitched in the ground confusedly
to keep the horsemen off from breaking in
more than three hours the fight continued
enacted wonders with his sword and lance
hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
here there and every where enrag'd he flew
the French exclaim'd the devil was in arms
all the whole army stood agaz'd on him
his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
a Talbot A Talbot cried out amain
and rush'd into the bowels of the battle
here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
if Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward
he being in the vaward plac'd behind
with purpose to relieve and follow them
cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
hence grew the general wrack and massacre
enclosed were they with their enemies
a base Walloon to win the Dauphin's grace
thrust Talbot with a spear into the back
whom all France with their chief assembled strength
durst not presume to look once in the face
is Talbot slain then I will slay myself
for living idly here in pomp and ease
whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
unto his dastard foemen is betray'd

O no he lives but is took prisoner
and Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford
most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise

his ransom there is none but I shall pay
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne
his crown shall be the ransom of my friend
four of their lords I'll change for one of ours
farewell my masters to my task will I
bonfires in France forthwith I am to make
to keep our great Saint George's feast withal
ten thousand soldiers with me I will take
whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake

the English army is grown weak and faint
the Earl of Salisbury craveth supply
and hardly keeps his men from mutiny
since they so few watch such a multitude

remember lords your oaths to Henry sworn
either to quell the Dauphin utterly
or bring him in obedience to your yoke

I do remember it and here take my leave
to go about my preparation


I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can
to view the artillery and munition
and then I will proclaim young Henry king


to Eltham will I where the young king is
and for his safety there I'll best devise


each hath his place and function to attend
I am left out for me nothing remains
but long I will not be Jack-out-of-office
the king from Eltham I intend to steal
and sit at chiefest stern of public weal


Mars his true moving even as in the heavens
so in the earth to this day is not known
late did he shine upon the English side
now we are victors upon us he smiles
what towns of any moment but we have
at pleasure here we lie near Orleans
otherwhiles the famish'd English like pale ghosts
faintly besiege us one hour in a month

either they must be dieted like mules
and have their provender tied to their mouths
or piteous they will look like drowned mice

let's raise the siege why live we idly here
Talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury
and he may well in fretting spend his gall
nor men nor money hath he to make war

sound sound alarum we will rush on them
now for the honour of the forlorn French
him I forgive my death that killeth me
when he sees me go back one foot or fly

who ever saw the like what men have I
dogs cowards dastards I would ne'er have fled
but that they left me midst my enemies

he fighteth as one weary of his life
the other lords like lions wanting food
do rush upon us as their hungry prey

froissart a countryman of ours records
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred
during the time Edward the Third did reign
more truly now may this be verified
for none but Samsons and Goliases
it sendeth forth to skirmish One to ten
lean raw-bon'd rascals who would e'er suppose
they had such courage and audacity

let's leave this town for they are hare-brain'd slaves
and hunger will enforce them to be more eager
of old I know them rather with their teeth
the walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege

I think by some odd gimmals or device
else ne'er could they hold out so as they do
by my consent we'll e'en let them alone

be it so


where's the prince Dauphin I have news for him

bastard of Orleans thrice welcome to us

methinks your looks are sad your cheer appall'd
hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
be not dismay'd for succour is at hand
a holy maid hither with me I bring
which by a vision sent to her from heaven
ordained is to raise this tedious siege
and drive the English forth the bounds of France
the spirit of deep prophecy she hath
exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome
speak shall I call her in Believe my words
for they are certain and unfallible

go call her in

but first to try her skill
Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place
question her proudly let thy looks be stern
by this means shall we sound what skill she hath

fair maid is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats

Reignier is't thou that thinkest to beguile me
where is the Dauphin Come come from behind
I know thee well though never seen before
be not amaz'd there's nothing hid from me
in private will I talk with thee apart
stand back you lords and give us leave a while


Dauphin I am by birth a shepherd's daughter
my wit untrain'd in any kind of art
heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd
to shine on my contemptible estate
lo whilst I waited on my tender lambs
and to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks
God's mother deigned to appear to me
and in a vision full of majesty
will'd me to leave my base vocation
and free my country from calamity
her aid she promis'd and assur'd success
in complete glory she reveal'd herself
and whereas I was black and swart before
with those clear rays which she infus'd on me
that beauty am I bless'd with which you see
ask me what question thou canst possible
and I will answer unpremeditated
my courage try by combat if thou dar'st
resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
if thou receive me for thy war-like mate

thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms
only this proof I'll of thy valour make
in single combat thou shalt buckle with me
and if thou vanquishest thy words are true
otherwise I renounce all confidence

I am prepar'd here is my keen-edg'd sword
deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side
the which at Touraine in Saint Katharine's churchyard
out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth

then come o' God's name I fear no woman

and while I live I'll ne'er fly from a man


and fightest with the sword of Deborah

Christ's mother helps me else I were too weak

whoe'er helps thee tis thou that must help me
impatiently I burn with thy desire
my heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd
excellent Pucelle if thy name be so
let me thy servant and not sovereign be
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus

I must not yield to any rites of love
for my profession's sacred from above
when I have chased all thy foes from hence
then will I think upon a recompense

meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall

my lord methinks is very long in talk
doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
else ne'er could he so long protract his speech

shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean

he may mean more than we poor men do know
these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues

my lord where are you what devise you on
shall we give over Orleans or no

why no I say distrustful recreants
fight till the last gasp I will be your guard

what she says I'll confirm we'll fight it out

assign'd am I to be the English scourge
this night the siege assuredly I'll raise
expect Saint Martin's summer halcyon days
glory is like a circle in the water
which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
with Henry's death the English circle ends
dispersed are the glories it included
now am I like that proud insulting ship
which C sar and his fortune bare at once

was Mahomet inspired with a dove
thou with an eagle art inspired then
Helen the mother of great Constantine
nor yet Saint Philip's daughters were like thee
bright star of Venus fall'n down on the earth
how may I reverently worship thee enough

leave off delays and let us raise the siege

woman do what thou canst to save our honours
drive them from Orleans and be immortalis'd
presently we'll try Come let's away about it
no prophet will I trust if she prove false


I am come to survey the Tower this day
since Henry's death I fear there is conveyance
where be these warders that they wait not here
open the gates Tis Gloucester that calls


who's there that knocks so imperiously

it is the noble Duke of Gloucester

whoe'er he be you may not be let in

villains answer you so the Lord Protector

the Lord protect him so we answer him

who willed you or whose will stands but mine
there's none protector of the realm but I
break up the gates I'll be your warrantize
shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms

lieutenant is it you whose voice I hear
open the gates here's Gloucester that would enter

have patience noble Duke I may not open
the Cardinal of Winchester forbids
from him I have express commandment
that thou nor none of thine shall be let in

faint-hearted Woodvile prizest him fore me
arrogant Winchester that haughty prelate
whom Henry our late sovereign ne'er could brook
thou art no friend to God or to the king
open the gates or I'll shut thee out shortly
open the gates unto the Lord Protector
or we'll burst them open if that you come not quickly


how now ambitious Humphrey what means this

peel'd priest dost thou command me to be shut out

I do thou most usurping proditor
and not protector of the king or realm

stand back thou manifest conspirator
thou that contriv'dst to murder our dead lord
thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin
I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat
if thou proceed in this thy insolence

nay stand thou back I will not budge a foot
this be Damascus be thou cursed Cam

I will not slay thee but I'll drive thee back
thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
I'll use to carry thee out of this place

do what thou dar'st I'll beard thee to thy face

what am I dar'd and bearded to my face
draw men for all this privileged place
blue coats to tawny-coats Priest beware your beard

I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly
under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat
in spite of pope or dignities of church
here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down

Gloucester thou'lt answer this before the pope

Winchester goose I cry a rope a rope
thee I'll chase hence thou wolf in sheep's array
out tawny coats out scarlet hypocrite

fie lords that you being supreme magistrates
thus contumeliously should break the peace

peace mayor thou know'st little of my wrongs
here's Beaufort that regards nor God nor King
hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use

here's Gloucester a foe to citizens
one that still motions war and never peace
o'ercharging your free purses with large fines
that seeks to overthrow religion
because he is protector of the realm
and would have armour here out of the Tower
to crown himself king and suppress the prince

I will not answer thee with words but blows

nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife
but to make open proclamation
come officer as loud as e'er thou canst
cry

all manner of men assembled here in arms this day against God's peace and the king's we charge and command you in his highness' name to repair to your several dwelling-places and not to wear handle or use any sword weapon or dagger henceforward upon pain of death

cardinal I'll be no breaker of the law
but we shall meet and break our minds at large

Gloucester we will meet to thy cost be sure
thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work

I'll call for clubs if you will not away
this cardinal's more haughty than the devil

Mayor farewell thou dost but what thou mayst

for I intend to have it ere long


see the coast clear'd and then we will depart
good God these nobles should such stomachs bear
I myself fight not once in forty year


sirrah thou know'st how Orleans is besieg'd
and how the English have the suburbs won

father I know and oft have shot at them
howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim

but now thou shalt not Be thou rul'd by me
chief master-gunner am I of this town
something I must do to procure me grace
the prince's espials have informed me
how the English in the suburbs close entrench'd
in yonder tower to overpeer the city
and thence discover how with most advantage
they may vex us with shot or with assault
to intercept this inconvenience
a piece of ordnance gainst it I have plac'd
and fully even these three days have I watch'd
if I could see them Now boy do thou watch
for I can stay no longer
if thou spy'st any run and bring me word
and thou shalt find me at the Governor's


father I warrant you take you no care
I'll never trouble you if I may spy them


Talbot my life my joy again return'd
how wert thou handled being prisoner
or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd

the Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
called the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles
for him I was exchang'd and ransomed
but with a baser man at arms by far
once in contempt they would have barter'd me
which I disdaining scorn'd and craved death
rather than I would be so vile-esteem'd
in fine redeem'd I was as I desir'd
but O the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart
whom with my bare fists I would execute
if I now had him brought into my power

yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd

with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
in open market-place produc'd they me
to be a public spectacle to all
here said they is the terror of the French
then broke I from the officers that led me
and with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
to hurl at the beholders of my shame
my grisly countenance made others fly
none durst come near for fear of sudden death
in iron walls they deem'd me not secure
so great fear of my name mongst them was spread
that they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
and spurn in pieces posts of adamant
wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
that walk'd about me every minute-while
and if I did but stir out of my bed
ready they were to shoot me to the heart


I grieve to hear what torments you endur'd
but we will be reveng'd sufficiently
now it is supper-time in Orleans
here through this grate I count each one
let us look in the sight will much delight thee
sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale
let me have your express opinions
where is best place to make our battery next

I think at the North gate for there stand lords

and I here at the bulwark of the bridge

for aught I see this city must be famish'd
or with light skirmishes enfeebled


O Lord have mercy on us wretched sinners

O Lord have mercy on me woeful man

what chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us
speak Salisbury at least if thou canst speak
one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off
accursed tower accursed fatal hand
that hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy
in thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars
whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
his sword did ne'er leave striking in the field
yet liv'st thou Salisbury though thy speech doth fail
one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
the sun with one eye vieweth all the world
heaven be thou gracious to none alive
if Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
bear hence his body I will help to bury it
sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life
speak unto Talbot nay look up to him
Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
thou shalt not die whiles
he beckons with his hand and smiles on me
as who should say When I am dead and gone
Plantagenet I will and like thee Nero
play on the lute beholding the towns burn
wretched shall France be only in my name

what stir is this What tumult's in the heavens
whence cometh this alarum and the noise


my lord my lord the French have gather'd head
the Dauphin with one Joan la Pucelle join'd
a holy prophetess new risen up
is come with a great power to raise the siege


hear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan
it irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd
Frenchmen I'll be a Salisbury to you
Pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish
your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels
convey me Salisbury into his tent
and then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare


where is my strength my valour and my force
our English troops retire I cannot stay them
a woman clad in armour chaseth them


here here she comes I'll have a bout with thee
devil or devil's dam I'll conjure thee
blood will I draw on thee thou art a witch

and straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st

come come tis only I that must disgrace thee


heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail
and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder
but I will chastise this high-minded strumpet


Talbot farewell thy hour is not yet come
I must go victual Orleans forthwith

o'ertake me if thou canst I scorn thy strength
go go cheer up thy hunger-starved men
help Salisbury to make his testament
this day is ours as many more shall be


my thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel
I know not where I am nor what I do
a witch by fear not force like Hannibal
drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
are from their hives and houses driven away
now like to whelps we crying run away

hark countrymen either renew the fight
or tear the lions out of England's coat
renounce your soil give sheep in lions' stead
sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
or horse or oxen from the leopard
as you fly from your oft-subdued slaves

it will not be retire into your trenches
you all consented unto Salisbury's death
for none would strike a stroke in his revenge
Pucelle is entered into Orleans
in spite of us or aught that we could do
O would I were to die with Salisbury
the shame hereof will make me hide my head


advance our waving colours on the walls
thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word

divinest creature Astr a's daughter
how shall I honour thee for this success
thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
that one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next
France triumph in thy glorious prophetess
recover'd is the town of Orleans
more blessed hap did ne'er befall our state

why ring not out the bells throughout the town
Dauphin command the citizens make bonfires
and feast and banquet in the open streets
to celebrate the joy that God hath given us

all France will be replete with mirth and joy
when they shall hear how we have play'd the men

'Tis Joan not we by whom the day is won
and all the priests and friars in my realm
shall in procession sing her endless praise
a statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
than Rhodope's or Memphis ever was
in memory of her when she is dead
her ashes in an urn more precious
than the rich-jewell'd coffer of Darius
transported shall be at high festivals
before the kings and queens of France
no longer on Saint Denis will we cry
but Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint
come in and let us banquet royally
after this golden day of victory

sirs take your places and be vigilant
if any noise or soldier you perceive
near to the walls by some apparent sign
let us have knowledge at the court of guard


thus are poor servitors
when others sleep upon their quiet beds
constrain'd to watch in darkness rain and cold


lord regent and redoubted Burgundy
by whose approach the regions of Artois
Walloon and Picardy are friends to us
this happy night the Frenchmen are secure
having all day carous'd and banqueted
embrace we then this opportunity
as fitting best to quittance their deceit
contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery

coward of France how much he wrongs his fame
despairing of his own arm's fortitude
to join with witches and the help of hell

but what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure

a maid they say

a maid and be so martial

pray God she prove not masculine ere long
if underneath the standard of the French
she carry armour as she hath begun

well let them practise and converse with spirits
God is our fortress in whose conquering name
let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks

ascend brave Talbot we will follow thee

not all together better far I guess
that we do make our entrance several ways
that if it chance the one of us do fail

agreed I'll to yond corner

and I to this

and here will Talbot mount or make his grave
now Salisbury for thee and for the right
of English Henry shall this night appear
how much in duty I am bound to both


arm arm the enemy doth make assault

how now my lords what all unready so

unready ay and glad we scap'd so well

'Twas time I trow to wake and leave our beds
hearing alarums at our chamber-doors
of all exploits since first I follow'd arms
ne'er heard I of a war-like enterprise
more venturous or desperate than this

I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell

if not of hell the heavens sure favour him

here cometh Charles I marvel how he sped

tut holy Joan was his defensive guard


is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
didst thou at first to flatter us withal
make us partakers of a little gain
that now our loss might be ten times so much

wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend
sleeping or waking must I still prevail
or will you blame and lay the fault on me
improvident soldiers had your watch been good
this sudden mischief never could have fall'n

duke of Alen on this was your default
that being captain of the watch to-night
did look no better to that weighty charge

had all your quarters been so safely kept
as that whereof I had the government
we had not been thus shamefully surpris'd

mine was secure

and so was mine my lord

and for myself most part of all this night
within her quarter and mine own precinct
about relieving of the sentinels
then how or which way should they first break in

question my lords no further of the case
how or which way tis sure they found some place
but weakly guarded where the breach was made
and now there rests no other shift but this
to gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispers'd
and lay new platforms to endamage them

I'll be so bold to take what they have left
the cry of Talbot serves me for a sword
for I have loaden me with many spoils
using no other weapon but his name


the day begins to break and night is fled
whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth
here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit

bring forth the body of old Salisbury
and here advance it in the market-place
the middle centre of this cursed town
now have I paid my vow unto his soul
for every drop of blood was drawn from him
there hath at least five Frenchmen died to-night
and that hereafter ages may behold
what ruin happen'd in revenge of him
within their chiefest temple I'll erect
a tomb wherein his corse shall be interr'd
upon the which that every one may read
shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans
the treacherous manner of his mournful death
and what a terror he had been to France
but lords in all our bloody massacre
I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace
his new-come champion virtuous Joan of Arc
nor any of his false confederates
'Tis thought Lord Talbot when the fight began
rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds
they did amongst the troops of armed men
leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field

myself as far as I could well discern
for smoke and dusky vapours of the night
am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull
when arm in arm they both came swiftly running
like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
that could not live asunder day or night
after that things are set in order here
we'll follow them with all the power we have


all hail my lords Which of this princely train
call ye the war-like Talbot for his acts
so much applauded through the realm of France


the virtuous lady Countess of Auvergne
with modesty admiring thy renown
by me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
to visit her poor castle where she lies
that she may boast she hath beheld the man
whose glory fills the world with loud report

is it even so Nay then I see our wars
will turn into a peaceful comic sport
when ladies crave to be encounter'd with
you may not my lord despise her gentle suit

ne'er trust me then for when a world of men
could not prevail with all their oratory
yet hath a woman's kindness over-rul'd
and therefore tell her I return great thanks
and in submission will attend on her
will not your honours bear me company
no truly it is more than manners will
and I have heard it said unbidden guests
are often welcomest when they are gone

well then alone since there's no remedy
I mean to prove this lady's courtesy
come hither captain

you perceive my mind

I do my lord and mean accordingly


porter remember what I gave in charge
and when you have done so bring the keys to me

madam I will


I shall as famous be by this exploit
as Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death
great is the rumour of this dreadful knight
and his achievements of no less account
fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
to give their censure of these rare reports


madam
according as your ladyship desir'd
by message crav'd so is Lord Talbot come

and he is welcome What is this the man

madam it is

is this the scourge of France
is this the Talbot so much fear'd abroad
that with his name the mothers still their babes
I thought I should have seen some Hercules
a second Hector for his grim aspect
and large proportion of his strong-knit limbs
alas this is a child a silly dwarf
it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
should strike such terror to his enemies

madam I have been bold to trouble you
but since your ladyship is not at leisure
I'll sort some other time to visit you

what means he now Go ask him whither he goes

stay my Lord Talbot for my lady craves
to know the cause of your abrupt departure

marry for that she's in a wrong belief
I go to certify her Talbot's here

if thou be he then art thou prisoner

prisoner to whom

to me blood-thirsty lord
and for that cause I train'd thee to my house
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
for in my gallery thy picture hangs
but now the substance shall endure the like
and I will chain these legs and arms of thine
that hast by tyranny these many years
wasted our country slain our citizens
and sent our sons and husbands captivate

ha ha ha

laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moan

I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
whereon to practise your severity

why art not thou the man

I am indeed

then have I substance too

no no I am but shadow of myself
you are deceiv'd my substance is not here
for what you see is but the smallest part
and least proportion of humanity
I tell you madam were the whole frame here
it is of such a spacious lofty pitch
your roof were not sufficient to contain it

this is a riddling merchant for the nonce
he will be here and yet he is not here
how can these contrarieties agree
that will I show you presently


how say you madam are you now persuaded
that Talbot is but shadow of himself
these are his substance sinews arms and strength
with which he yoketh your rebellious necks
razeth your cities and subverts your towns

and in a moment makes them desolate

victorious Talbot pardon my abuse
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
and more than may be gather'd by thy shape
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
for I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art

be not dismay'd fair lady nor misconster
the outward composition of his body
what you have done hath not offended me
nor other satisfaction do I crave
but only with your patience that we may
taste of your wine and see what cates you have
for soldiers' stomachs always serve them well

with all my heart and think me honoured
to feast so great a warrior in my house


great lords and gentlemen what means this silence
dare no man answer in a case of truth

within the Temple hall we were too loud
the garden here is more convenient

then say at once if I maintain'd the truth
or else was wrangling Somerset in the error
faith I have been a truant in the law
and never yet could frame my will to it
and therefore frame the law unto my will

judge you my Lord of Warwick then between us

between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
between two blades which bears the better temper
between two horses which doth bear him best
between two girls which hath the merriest eye
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment
but in these nice sharp quillets of the law
good faith I am no wiser than a daw

tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
the truth appears so naked on my side
that any purblind eye may find it out

so clear so shining and so evident
that it will glimmer through a blind man's eye

since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak
in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
let him that is a true-born gentleman
and stands upon the honour of his birth
if he suppose that I have pleaded truth
from off this brier pluck a white rose with me

let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
but dare maintain the party of the truth
pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me

I love no colours and without all colour
of base insinuating flattery
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet

I pluck this red rose with young Somerset

stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
till you conclude that he upon whose side
the fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
shall yield the other in the right opinion

good Master Vernon it is well objected
if I have fewest I subscribe in silence

and I

then for the truth and plainness of the case
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
giving my verdict on the white rose side

prick not your finger as you pluck it off
lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
and fall on my side so against your will

opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
and keep me on the side where still I am

well well come on who else

unless my study and my books be false
the argument you held was wrong in you
in sign whereof I pluck a white rose too

now Somerset where is your argument

here in my scabbard meditating that
shall dye your white rose in a bloody red

meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses
for pale they look with fear as witnessing
the truth on our side

no Plantagenet
blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error

hath not thy rose a canker Somerset

hath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet

ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood

well I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
that shall maintain what I have said is true
where false Plantagenet dare not be seen

now by this maiden blossom in my hand
I scorn thee and thy faction peevish boy

turn not thy scorns this way Plantagenet


I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat

away away good William de la Pole
we grace the yeoman by conversing with him

now by God's will thou wrong'st him Somerset
his grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence
third son to the third Edward King of England
spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root

he bears him on the place's privilege
or durst not for his craven heart say thus

by Him that made me I'll maintain my words
on any plot of ground in Christendom
was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge
for treason executed in our late king's days
and by his treason stand'st not thou attainted
his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
and till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman

my father was attached not attained
condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor
and that I'll prove on better men than Somerset
were growing time once ripen'd to my will
for your partaker Pole and you yourself
I'll note you in my book of memory
to scourge you for this apprehension
look to it well and say you are well warn'd

Ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still
and know us by these colours for thy foes
for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear

and by my soul this pale and angry rose
as cognizance of my blood-drinking hate
will I for ever and my faction wear
or flourish to the height of my degree

go forward and be chok'd with thy ambition
and so farewell until I meet thee next


have with thee Pole Farewell ambitious Richard


how I am brav'd and must perforce endure it

this blot that they object against your house
shall be wip'd out in the next parliament
call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester
and if thou be not then created York
I will not live to be accounted Warwick
meantime in signal of my love to thee
against proud Somerset and William Pole
will I upon thy party wear this rose
grown to this faction in the Temple garden
shall send between the red rose and the white
a thousand souls to death and deadly night

good Master Vernon I am bound to you
that you on my behalf would pluck a flower

in your behalf still would I wear the same

and so will I

thanks gentle sir
come let us four to dinner I dare say
this quarrel will drink blood another day


kind keepers of my weak decaying age
let dying Mortimer here rest himself
even like a man new haled from the rack
and these gray locks the pursuivants of death
nestor-like aged in an age of care
argue the end of Edmund Mortimer
these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
wax dim as drawing to their exigent
weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief
and pithless arms like to a wither'd vine
that droops his sapless branches to the ground
yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
unable to support this lump of clay
swift-winged with desire to get a grave
as witting I no other comfort have
but tell me keeper will my nephew come

Richard Plantagenet my lord will come
we sent unto the Temple unto his chamber
and answer was return'd that he will come

enough my soul shall then be satisfied
since Henry Monmouth first began to reign
before whose glory I was great in arms
this loathsome sequestration have I had
and even since then hath Richard been obscur'd
depriv'd of honour and inheritance
but now the arbitrator of despairs
just death kind umpire of men's miseries
with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
I would his troubles likewise were expir'd
that so he might recover what was lost


my lord your loving nephew now is come

Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come

ay noble uncle thus ignobly us'd
your nephew late despised Richard comes

and in his bosom spend my latter gasp
O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
that I may kindly give one fainting kiss
and now declare sweet stem from York's great stock
why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd

first lean thine aged back against mine arm
and in that ease I'll tell thee my disease
this day in argument upon a case
some words there grew twixt Somerset and me
among which terms he us'd a lavish tongue
and did upbraid me with my father's death
which obloquy set bars before my tongue
else with the like I had requited him
therefore good uncle for my father's sake
in honour of a true Plantagenet
and for alliance sake declare the cause
my father Earl of Cambridge lost his head

and hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth
within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
was cursed instrument of his decease

discover more at large what cause that was
for I am ignorant and cannot guess

I will if that my fading breath permit
and death approach not ere my tale be done
Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king
depos'd his nephew Richard Edward's son
the first-begotten and the lawful heir
of Edward king the third of that descent
during whose reign the Percies of the North
finding his usurpation most unjust
endeavour'd my advancement to the throne
the reason mov'd these warlike lords to this
was for that young King Richard thus remov'd
leaving no heir begotten of his body
for by my mother I derived am
from Lionel Duke of Clarence the third son
to King Edward the Third whereas he
from John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree
being but fourth of that heroic line
but mark as in this haughty great attempt
they laboured to plant the rightful heir
I lost my liberty and they their lives
long after this when Henry the Fifth
succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign
thy father Earl of Cambridge then deriv'd
from famous Edmund Langley Duke of York
marrying my sister that thy mother was
again in pity of my hard distress
levied an army weening to redeem
and have install'd me in the diadem
but as the rest so fell that noble earl
and was beheaded Thus the Mortimers
in whom the title rested were suppress'd
of which my lord your honour is the last

true and thou seest that I no issue have
and that my fainting words do warrant death
thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather
but yet be wary in thy studious care

thy grave admonishments prevail with me
but yet methinks my father's execution
was nothing less than bloody tyranny

with silence nephew be thou politic
strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster
and like a mountain not to be remov'd
but now thy uncle is removing hence
as princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
with long continuance in a settled place

O uncle would some part of my young years

thou dost then wrong me as the slaughterer doth
which giveth many wounds when one will kill
mourn not except thou sorrow for my good
only give order for my funeral
and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
and prosperous be thy life in peace and war


and peace no war befall thy parting soul
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
and like a hermit overpass'd thy days
well I will lock his counsel in my breast
and what I do imagine let that rest
keepers convey him hence and I myself
will see his burial better than his life

here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer
chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort
which Somerset hath offer'd to my house
I doubt not but with honour to redress
and therefore haste I to the parliament
either to be restored to my blood
or make my ill the advantage of my good


com'st thou with deep premeditated lines
with written pamphlets studiously devis'd
Humphrey of Gloucester If thou canst accuse
or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge
do it without invention suddenly
as I with sudden and extemporal speech
purpose to answer what thou canst object

presumptuous priest this place commands my patience
or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me
think not although in writing I preferr'd
the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
as very infants prattle of thy pride
thou art a most pernicious usurer
froward by nature enemy to peace
lascivious wanton more than well beseems
a man of thy profession and degree
and for thy treachery what's more manifest
in that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
as well at London Bridge as at the Tower
beside I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
the king thy sov'reign is not quite exempt
from envious malice of thy swelling heart

Gloucester I do defy thee Lords vouchsafe
to give me hearing what I shall reply
if I were covetous ambitious or perverse
as he will have me how am I so poor
or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
and for dissension who preferreth peace
more than I do except I be provok'd
no my good lords it is not that offends
it is not that that hath incens'd the duke
it is because no one should sway but he
no one but he should be about the king
and that engenders thunder in his breast
and makes him roar these accusations forth
but he shall know I am as good

as good
thou bastard of my grandfather

ay lordly sir for what are you I pray
but one imperious in another's throne

am I not protector saucy priest


yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
and useth it to patronage his theft

unreverent Gloucester

thou art reverent
touching thy spiritual function not thy life

Rome shall remedy this

roam thither then

my lord it were your duty to forbear

ay see the bishop be not overborne

methinks my lord should be religious
and know the office that belongs to such
methinks his lordship should be humbler
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead

yes when his holy state is touch'd so near

state holy or unhallow'd what of that
is not his Grace protector to the king

Plantagenet I see must hold his tongue
lest it be said Speak sirrah when you should
must your bold verdict enter talk with lords
else would I have a fling at Winchester

uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester
the special watchmen of our English weal
I would prevail if prayers might prevail
to join your hearts in love and amity
O what a scandal is it to our crown
that two such noble peers as ye should jar
civil dissension is a viperous worm
that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth

what tumult's this

an uproar I dare warrant
begun through malice of the bishop's men

O my good lords and virtuous Henry
pity the city of London pity us
the bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men
forbidden late to carry any weapon
have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
and banding themselves in contrary parts
do pelt so fast at one another's pate
that many have their giddy brains knock'd out
our windows are broke down in every street
and we for fear compell'd to shut our shops

we charge you on allegiance to ourself
to hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace
pray uncle Gloucester mitigate this strife

nay if we be forbidden stones we'll fall to it with our teeth

do what ye dare we are as resolute


you of my household leave this peevish broil
and set this unaccustom'd fight aside

my lord we know your Grace to be a man
just and upright and for your royal birth
inferior to none but to his majesty
and ere that we will suffer such a prince
so kind a father of the commonweal
to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
we and our wives and children all will fight

ay and the very parings of our nails
shall pitch a field when we are dead


stay stay I say
and if you love me as you say you do
let me persuade you to forbear a while

O how this discord doth afflict my soul
can you my Lord of Winchester behold
my sighs and tears and will not once relent
who should be pitiful if you be not
or who should study to prefer a peace
if holy churchmen take delight in broils

yield my Lord Protector yield Winchester
except you mean with obstinate repulse
to slay your sov'reign and destroy the realm
hath been enacted through your enmity
then be at peace except ye thirst for blood

he shall submit or I will never yield

compassion on the king commands me stoop
or I would see his heart out ere the priest
should ever get that privilege of me

behold my Lord of Winchester the duke
hath banish'd moody discontented fury
as by his smoothed brows it doth appear
why look you still so stern and tragical

here Winchester I offer thee my hand

fie uncle Beaufort I have heard you preach
that malice was a great and grievous sin
and will not you maintain the thing you teach

sweet king the bishop hath a kindly gird
for shame my Lord of Winchester relent
what shall a child instruct you what to do

well Duke of Gloucester I will yield to thee
love for thy love and hand for hand I give

ay but I fear me with a hollow heart
see here my friends and loving countrymen
this token serveth for a flag of truce
betwixt ourselves and all our followers
so help me God as I dissemble not

so help me God as I intend it not

O loving uncle kind Duke of Gloucester
how joyful am I made by this contract
away my masters trouble us no more

content I'll to the surgeon's

and so will I

and I will see what physic the tavern affords


accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
we do exhibit to your majesty

well urg'd my Lord of Warwick for sweet prince
an if your Grace mark every circumstance
you have great reason to do Richard right
especially for those occasions
at Eltham-place I told your majesty

and those occasions uncle were of force
that Richard be restored to his blood

let Richard be restored to his blood
so shall his father's wrongs be recompens'd

as will the rest so willeth Winchester

if Richard will be true not that alone
but all the whole inheritance I give
that doth belong unto the house of York
from whence you spring by lineal descent

thy humble servant vows obedience
and humble service till the point of death

stoop then and set your knee against my foot
and in reguerdon of that duty done
I girt thee with the valiant sword of York
rise Richard like a true Plantagenet

and so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall
and as my duty springs so perish they
that grudge one thought against your majesty

welcome high prince the mighty Duke of York

perish base prince ignoble Duke of York

now will it best avail your majesty
to cross the seas and to be crown'd in France
the presence of a king engenders love
amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
as it disanimates his enemies

when Gloucester says the word King Henry goes
for friendly counsel cuts off many foes

your ships already are in readiness

ay we may march in England or in France
not seeing what is likely to ensue
this late dissension grown betwixt the peers
burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love
and will at last break out into a flame
as fester'd members rot but by degree
till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
so will this base and envious discord breed
and now I fear that fatal prophecy
which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth
was in the mouth of every sucking babe
that Henry born at Monmouth should win all
and Henry born at Windsor should lose all
which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
his days may finish ere that hapless time

these are the city gates the gates of Roan
through which our policy must make a breach
talk like the vulgar sort of market-men
that come to gather money for their corn
if we have entrance as I hope we shall
and that we find the slothful watch but weak
I'll by a sign give notice to our friends
that Charles the Dauphin may encounter them

our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city
and we be lords and rulers over Roan
therefore we'll knock


qui est l

paisans pauvres gens de France
poor market-folks that come to sell their corn

enter go in the market-bell is rung


Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem
and once again we'll sleep secure in Roan

here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants
now she is there how will she specify
where is the best and safest passage in

by thrusting out a torch from yonder tower
which once discern'd shows that her meaning is
no way to that for weakness which she enter'd


behold this is the happy wedding torch
that joineth Roan unto her countrymen
but burning fatal to the Talbotites


see noble Charles the beacon of our friend

now shine it like a comet of revenge
a prophet to the fall of all our foes

defer no time delays have dangerous ends
enter and cry The Dauphin presently
and then do execution on the watch

France thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears
if Talbot but survive thy treachery
Pucelle that witch that damned sorceress
hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares
that hardly we escap'd the pride of France


good morrow gallants Want ye corn for bread
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
before he'll buy again at such a rate
'Twas full of darnel do you like the taste
scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
and make thee curse the harvest of that corn

your Grace may starve perhaps before that time

O let no words but deeds revenge this treason

what will you do good grey-beard break a lance
and run a tilt at death within a chair

foul fiend of France and hag of all despite
encompass'd with thy lustful paramours
becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
and twit with cowardice a man half dead
damsel I'll have a bout with you again
or else let Talbot perish with this shame

are you so hot sir Yet Pucelle hold thy peace

God speed the parliament who shall be the speaker

dare ye come forth and meet us in the field

belike your lordship takes us then for fools
to try if that our own be ours or no

I speak not to that railing Hecate
but unto thee Alen on and the rest
will ye like soldiers come and fight it out

Signior no

Signior hang base muleters of France
like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
and dare not take up arms like gentlemen

away captains let's get us from the walls
God be wi' you my lord we came but to tell you
that we are here


and there will we be too ere it be long
or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame
vow Burgundy by honour of thy house
prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France
either to get the town again or die
and I as sure as English Henry lives
and as his father here was conqueror
as sure as in this late-betrayed town
great C ur-de-lion's heart was buried
so sure I swear to get the town or die

my vows are equal partners with thy vows

but ere we go regard this dying prince
the valiant Duke of Bedford Come my lord
fitter for sickness and for crazy age

lord Talbot do not so dishonour me
here will I sit before the walls of Roan
and will be partner of your weal or woe

courageous Bedford let us now persuade you

not to be gone from hence for once I read
that stout Pendragon in his litter sick
came to the field and vanquished his foes
methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts
because I ever found them as myself

undaunted spirit in a dying breast
then be it so heavens keep old Bedford safe
and now no more ado brave Burgundy
but gather we our forces out of hand
and set upon our boasting enemy
whither away Sir John Fastolfe in such haste

whither away to save myself by flight
we are like to have the overthrow again

what will you fly and leave Lord Talbot

ay
all the Talbots in the world to save my life


cowardly knight ill fortune follow thee


now quiet soul depart when Heaven please
for I have seen our enemies' overthrow
what is the trust or strength of foolish man
they that of late were daring with their scoffs
are glad and fain by flight to save themselves
lost and recover'd in a day again
this is a double honour Burgundy
yet heavens have glory for this victory

warlike and martial Talbot Burgundy
enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
thy noble deeds as valour's monument

thanks gentle duke But where is Pucelle now
I think her old familiar is asleep
now where's the Bastard's braves and Charles his gleeks
what all amort Roan hangs her head for grief
that such a valiant company are fled
now will we take some order in the town
placing therein some expert officers
and then depart to Paris to the king
for there young Henry with his nobles lie

what wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy
but yet before we go let's not forget
the noble Duke of Bedford late deceas'd
but see his exequies fulfill'd in Roan
a braver soldier never couched lance
a gentler heart did never sway in court
but kings and mightiest potentates must die
for that's the end of human misery


dismay not princes at this accident
nor grieve that Roan is so recovered
care is no cure but rather corrosive
for things that are not to be remedied
let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
and like a peacock sweep along his tail
we'll pull his plumes and take away his train
if Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'd

we have been guided by thee hitherto
one sudden foil shall never breed distrust

search out thy wit for secret policies
and we will make thee famous through the world

we'll set thy statue in some holy place
and have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint
employ thee then sweet virgin for our good

then thus it must be this doth Joan devise
by fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
we will entice the Duke of Burgundy
to leave the Talbot and to follow us

ay marry sweeting if we could do that
France were no place for Henry's warriors
nor should that nation boast it so with us
but be extirped from our provinces

and not have title of an earldom here

your honours shall perceive how I will work
to bring this matter to the wished end

hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
their powers are marching unto Paris-ward


there goes the Talbot with his colours spread
and all the troops of English after him

now in the rearward comes the duke and his
fortune in favour makes him lag behind
summon a parley we will talk with him

a parley with the Duke of Burgundy

who craves a parley with the Burgundy
the princely Charles of France thy countryman

what sayst thou Charles for I am marching hence

speak Pucelle and enchant him with thy words

brave Burgundy undoubted hope of France
stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee

speak on but be not over-tedious

look on thy country look on fertile France
and see the cities and the towns defac'd
by wasting ruin of the cruel foe
as looks the mother on her lowly babe
when death doth close his tender dying eyes
see see the pining malady of France
behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
which thou thyself hast giv'n her woeful breast
strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
one drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
return thee therefore with a flood of tears
and wash away thy country's stained spots

either she hath bewitch'd me with her words
or nature makes me suddenly relent

besides all French and France exclaims on thee
doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation
that will not trust thee but for profit's sake
when Talbot hath set footing once in France
and fashion'd thee that instrument of ill
who then but English Henry will be lord
and thou be thrust out like a fugitive
call we to mind and mark but this for proof
was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe
but when they heard he was thine enemy
they set him free without his ransom paid
in spite of Burgundy and all his friends
see then thou fight'st against thy countrymen
and join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen
come come return return thou wand'ring lord
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms

I am vanquished these haughty words of hers
have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot
and made me almost yield upon my knees
forgive me country and sweet countrymen
and lords accept this hearty kind embrace
my forces and my power of men are yours
so farewell Talbot I'll no longer trust thee

done like a Frenchman turn and turn again

welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh
and doth beget new courage in our breasts

Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this
and doth deserve a coronet of gold

now let us on my lords and join our powers
and seek how we may prejudice the foe


my gracious prince and honourable peers
hearing of your arrival in this realm
I have a while giv'n truce unto my wars
to do my duty to my sovereign
in sign whereof this arm that hath reclaim'd
to your obedience fifty fortresses
twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength
beside five hundred prisoners of esteem
lets fall his sword before your highness' feet

ascribes the glory of his conquest got
first to my God and next unto your Grace

is this the Lord Talbot uncle Gloucester
that hath so long been resident in France

yes if it please your majesty my liege

welcome brave captain and victorious lord
when I was young as yet I am not old
I do remember how my father said
a stouter champion never handled sword
long since we were resolved of your truth
your faithful service and your toil in war
yet never have you tasted our reward
or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks
because till now we never saw your face
therefore stand up and for these good deserts
we here create you Earl of Shrewsbury


now sir to you that were so hot at sea
disgracing of these colours that I wear
in honour of my noble Lord of York
dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st

yes sir as well as you dare patronage
the envious barking of your saucy tongue
against my lord the Duke of Somerset

sirrah thy lord I honour as he is

why what is he as good a man as York

hark ye not so in witness take ye that


villain thou know'st the law of arms is such
or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood
but I'll unto his majesty and crave
I may have liberty to venge this wrong
when thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost

well miscreant I'll be there as soon as you
and after meet you sooner than you would


lord bishop set the crown upon his head

God save King Henry of that name the sixth

now Governor of Paris take your oath

that you elect no other king but him
esteem none friends but such as are his friends
and none your foes but such as shall pretend
malicious practices against his state

my gracious sovereign as I rode from Calais
to haste unto your coronation
a letter was deliver'd to my hands
writ to your Grace from the Duke of Burgundy

shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee
I vow'd base knight when I did meet thee next
to tear the garter from thy craven's leg

which I have done because unworthily
thou wast installed in that high degree
pardon me princely Henry and the rest
this dastard at the battle of Patay
when but in all I was six thousand strong
and that the French were almost ten to one
before we met or that a stroke was given
like to a trusty squire did run away
in which assault we lost twelve hundred men
were there surpris'd and taken prisoners
then judge great lords if I have done amiss
or whether that such cowards ought to wear
this ornament of knighthood yea or no

to say the truth this fact was infamous
and ill beseeming any common man
much more a knight a captain and a leader

when first this order was ordain'd my lords
knights of the garter were of noble birth
valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
such as were grown to credit by the wars
not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
but always resolute in most extremes
he then that is not furnish'd in this sort
doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
profaning this most honourable order
and should if I were worthy to be judge
that doth presume to boast of gentle blood

stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom
be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
henceforth we banish thee on pain of death

and now my Lord Protector view the letter
sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy

what means his Grace that he hath chang'd his style
no more but plain and bluntly To the King
hath he forgot he is his sovereign
or doth this churlish superscription
pretend some alteration in good will
what's here I have upon especial cause
mov'd with compassion of my country's wrack
together with the pitiful complaints
of such as your oppression feeds upon
forsaken your pernicious faction
O monstrous treachery Can this be so
that in alliance amity and oaths
there should be found such false dissembling guile

what doth my uncle Burgundy revolt

he doth my lord and is become your foe

is that the worst this letter doth contain

it is the worst and all my lord he writes

why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with him
and give him chastisement for this abuse
how say you my lord are you not content

content my liege Yes but that I am prevented
I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd

let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
and what offence it is to flout his friends

I go my lord in heart desiring still
you may behold confusion of your foes

grant me the combat gracious sovereign

and me my lord grant me the combat too

this is my servant hear him noble prince

and this is mine sweet Henry favour him

be patient lords and give them leave to speak
say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim
and wherefore crave you combat or with whom

with him my lord for he hath done me wrong
and I with him for he hath done me wrong

what is that wrong whereof you both complain
first let me know and then I'll answer you

crossing the sea from England into France
this fellow here with envious carping tongue
upbraided me about the rose I wear
saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
did represent my master's blushing cheeks
when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
about a certain question in the law
argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him
with other vile and ignominious terms
in confutation of which rude reproach
and in defence of my lord's worthiness
I crave the benefit of law of arms

and that is my petition noble lord
to set a gloss upon his bold intent
yet know my lord I was provok'd by him
and he first took exceptions at this badge
pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart

will not this malice Somerset be left

your private grudge my Lord of York will out
though ne'er so cunningly you smother it

good Lord what madness rules in brain-sick men
when for so slight and frivolous a cause
such factious emulations shall arise
good cousins both of York and Somerset
quiet yourselves I pray and be at peace

let this dissension first be tried by fight
and then your highness shall command a peace
the quarrel toucheth none but us alone
betwixt ourselves let us decide it then

there is my pledge accept it Somerset

nay let it rest where it began at first

confirm it so mine honourable lord

confirm it so Confounded be your strife
and perish ye with your audacious prate
presumptuous vassals are you not asham'd
with this immodest clamorous outrage
to trouble and disturb the king and us
and you my lords methinks you do not well
to bear with their perverse objections
much less to take occasion from their mouths
to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
let me persuade you take a better course
it grieves his highness good my lords be friends

come hither you that would be combatants
henceforth I charge you as you love our favour
quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
and you my lords remember where we are
in France amongst a fickle wav'ring nation
if they perceive dissension in our looks
and that within ourselves we disagree
how will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
to wilful disobedience and rebel
beside what infamy will there arise
when foreign princes shall be certified
that for a toy a thing of no regard
king Henry's peers and chief nobility
destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France
O think upon the conquest of my father
my tender years and let us not forego
that for a trifle that was bought with blood
I see no reason if I wear this rose

that any one should therefore be suspicious
I more incline to Somerset than York
both are my kinsmen and I love them both
as well they may upbraid me with my crown
because forsooth the King of Scots is crown'd
but your discretions better can persuade
than I am able to instruct or teach
and therefore as we hither came in peace
so let us still continue peace and love
cousin of York we institute your Grace
to be our regent in these parts of France
and good my Lord of Somerset unite
your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
and like true subjects sons of your progenitors
go cheerfully together and digest
your angry choler on your enemies
ourself my Lord Protector and the rest
from thence to England where I hope ere long
to be presented by your victories
with Charles Alen on and that traitorous rout


my Lord of York I promise you the king Prettily methought did play the orator

and so he did but yet I like it not
in that he wears the badge of Somerset

tush that was but his fancy blame him not
I dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm

an if I wist he did But let it rest
other affairs must now be managed


well didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice
for had the passions of thy heart burst out
more rancorous spite more furious raging broils
than yet can be imagin'd or suppos'd
but howsoe'er no simple man that sees
this jarring discord of nobility
this shouldering of each other in the court
this factious bandying of their favourites
but that it doth presage some ill event
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands
but more when envy breeds unkind division
there comes the ruin there begins confusion


go to the gates of Bourdeaux trumpeter
summon their general unto the wall


English John Talbot captains calls you forth
servant in arms to Harry King of England
and thus he would Open your city gates
and do him homage as obedient subjects
and I'll withdraw me and my bloody power
but if you frown upon this proffer'd peace
you tempt the fury of my three attendants
lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire
who in a moment even with the earth
shall lay your stately and air-braving towers

if you forsake the offer of their love

thou ominous and fearful owl of death
our nation's terror and their bloody scourge
the period of thy tyranny approacheth
on us thou canst not enter but by death
for I protest we are well fortified
and strong enough to issue out and fight
if thou retire the Dauphin well appointed
stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
on either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd
and no way canst thou turn thee for redress
but death doth front thee with apparent spoil
and pale destruction meets thee in the face
ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
to rive their dangerous artillery
upon no Christian soul but English Talbot
lo there thou stand'st a breathing valiant man
of an invincible unconquer'd spirit
this is the latest glory of thy praise
that I thy enemy due thee withal
for ere the glass that now begins to run
finish the process of his sandy hour
these eyes that see thee now well coloured
shall see thee wither'd bloody pale and dead

hark hark the Dauphin's drum a warning bell
sings heavy music to thy timorous soul
and mine shall ring thy dire departure out

he fables not I hear the enemy
out some light horsemen and peruse their wings
O negligent and heedless discipline
how are we park'd and bounded in a pale
a little herd of England's timorous deer
maz'd with a yelping kennel of French curs
if we be English deer be then in blood
not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch
but rather moody-mad and desperate stags
turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
and make the cowards stand aloof at bay
sell every man his life as dear as mine
and they shall find dear deer of us my friends
God and Saint George Talbot and England's right
prosper our colours in this dangerous fight


are not the speedy scouts return'd again
that dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin
they are return'd my lord and give it out
that he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power
to fight with Talbot As he march'd along
by your espials were discovered
two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led
which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux

a plague upon that villain Somerset
that thus delays my promised supply
of horsemen that were levied for this siege
renowned Talbot doth expect my aid
and I am louted by a traitor villain
and cannot help the noble chevalier
God comfort him in this necessity
if he miscarry farewell wars in France


thou princely leader of our English strength
never so needful on the earth of France
who now is girdled with a waist of iron
and hemm'd about with grim destruction
to Bourdeaux war-like duke To Bourdeaux York
else farewell Talbot France and England's honour

O God that Somerset who in proud heart
doth stop my cornets were in Talbot's place
so should we save a valiant gentleman
by forfeiting a traitor and a coward
mad ire and wrathful fury make me weep
that thus we die while remiss traitors sleep

O send some succour to the distress'd lord

he dies we lose I break my war-like word
we mourn France smiles we lose they daily get
all long of this vile traitor Somerset

then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul
I met in travel toward his war-like father
this seven years did not Talbot see his son
and now they meet where both their lives are done

alas what joy shall noble Talbot have
to bid his young son welcome to his grave
away vexation almost stops my breath
that sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death
Lucy farewell no more my fortune can
but curse the cause I cannot aid the man
Maine Blois Poictiers and Tours are won away
'Long all of Somerset and his delay


thus while the vulture of sedition
feeds in the bosom of such great commanders
sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
the conquest of our scarce cold conqueror
that ever living man of memory
lives honours lands and all hurry to loss


it is too late I cannot send them now
this expedition was by York and Talbot
too rashly plotted all our general force
might with a sally of the very town
be buckled with the over-daring Talbot
hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
by this unheedful desperate wild adventure
York set him on to fight and die in shame
that Talbot dead great York might bear the name

here is Sir William Lucy who with me
set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid


how now Sir William whither were you sent

who ring'd about with bold adversity
cries out for noble York and Somerset
to beat assailing death from his weak legions
and whiles the honourable captain there
drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs
and in advantage lingering looks for rescue
you his false hopes the trust of England's honour
keep off aloof with worthless emulation
let not your private discord keep away
the levied succours that should lend him aid
while he renowned noble gentleman
yields up his life unto a world of odds
Orleans the Bastard Charles Burgundy
Alen on Reignier compass him about
and Talbot perisheth by your default

York set him on York should have sent him aid

and York as fast upon your Grace exclaims
collected for this expedition

York lies he might have sent and had the horse
I owe him little duty and less love
and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending

the fraud of England not the force of France
hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot
never to England shall he bear his life
but dies betray'd to fortune by your strife

come go I will dispatch the horsemen straight
within six hours they will be at his aid

too late comes rescue he is ta'en or slain
for fly he could not if he would have fled
and fly would Talbot never though he might

if he be dead brave Talbot then adieu
his fame lives in the world his shame in you


O young John Talbot I did send for thee
to tutor thee in stratagems of war
that Talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
when sapless age and weak unable limbs
should bring thy father to his drooping chair
but O malignant and ill-boding stars
now thou art come unto a feast of death
a terrible and unavoided danger
therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
and I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
by sudden flight come dally not be gone

is my name Talbot and am I your son
and shall I fly O if you love my mother
dishonour not her honourable name
to make a bastard and a slave of me
that basely fled when noble Talbot stood

fly to revenge my death if I be slain

he that flies so will ne'er return again

if we both stay we both are sure to die

then let me stay and father do you fly
your loss is great so your regard should be
my worth unknown no loss is known in me
upon my death the French can little boast
in yours they will in you all hopes are lost
flight cannot stain the honour you have won
but mine it will that no exploit have done
you fled for vantage everyone will swear
but if I bow they'll say it was for fear
there is no hope that ever I will stay
if the first hour I shrink and run away
rather than life preserv'd with infamy

shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb

ay rather than I'll shame my mother's womb

upon my blessing I command thee go

to fight I will but not to fly the foe

part of thy father may be sav'd in thee

no part of him but will be shame in me

thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it

yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it

thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain
you cannot witness for me being slain
if death be so apparent then both fly

and leave my followers here to fight and die
my age was never tainted with such shame

and shall my youth be guilty of such blame
no more can I be sever'd from your side
than can yourself yourself in twain divide
stay go do what you will the like do I
for live I will not if my father die

then here I take my leave of thee fair son
born to eclipse thy life this afternoon
come side by side together live and die
and soul with soul from France to heaven fly

Saint George and victory fight soldiers fight
the regent hath with Talbot broke his word
where is John Talbot Pause and take thy breath
I gave thee life and rescu'd thee from death

O twice my father twice am I thy son
the life thou gav'st me first was lost and done
till with thy war-like sword despite of fate
to my determin'd time thou gav'st new date

when from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire
it warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
of bold-fac'd victory Then leaden age
quicken'd with youthful spleen and war-like rage
beat down Alen on Orleans Burgundy
and from the pride of Gallia rescu'd thee
the ireful bastard Orleans that drew blood
from thee my boy and had the maidenhood
of thy first fight I soon encountered
and interchanging blows I quickly shed
some of his bastard blood and in disgrace
and misbegotten blood I spill of thine
mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine
which thou didst force from Talbot my brave boy
here purposing the Bastard to destroy
came in strong rescue Speak thy father's care
art thou not weary John How dost thou fare
wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly
now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry
fly to revenge my death when I am dead
the help of one stands me in little stead
O too much folly is it well I wot
to hazard all our lives in one small boat
if I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage
to-morrow I shall die with mickle age
by me they nothing gain an if I stay
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day
in thee thy mother dies our household's name
my death's revenge thy youth and England's fame
all these and more we hazard by thy stay

the sword of Orleans hath not made me smart
these words of yours draw life-blood from my heart
on that advantage bought with such a shame
to save a paltry life and slay bright fame
before young Talbot from old Talbot fly
the coward horse that bears me fall and die
and like me to the peasant boys of France
to be shame's scorn and subject of mischance
surely by all the glory you have won
an if I fly I am not Talbot's son
then talk no more of flight it is no boot
if son to Talbot die at Talbot's foot

then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete
thou Icarus Thy life to me is sweet
if thou wilt fight fight by thy father's side
and commendable prov'd let's die in pride

where is my other life mine own is gone
O where's young Talbot where is valiant John
triumphant death smear'd with captivity
young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee
when he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee
his bloody sword he brandish'd over me
and like a hungry lion did commence
rough deeds of rage and stern impatience
but when my angry guardant stood alone
tendering my ruin and assail'd of none
dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
suddenly made him from my side to start
into the clust'ring battle of the French
and in that sea of blood my boy did drench
his overmounting spirit and there died
my Icarus my blossom in his pride


O my dear lord lo where your son is borne
thou antick death which laugh'st us here to scorn
anon from thy insulting tyranny
coupled in bonds of perpetuity
two Talbots winged through the lither sky
in thy despite shall scape mortality
O thou whose wounds become hard-favour'd death
speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath
brave death by speaking whe'r he will or no
imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe
poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say
had death been French then death had died to-day
come come and lay him in his father's arms
my spirit can no longer bear these harms
soldiers adieu I have what I would have
now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave

had York and Somerset brought rescue in
we should have found a bloody day of this

did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood

once I encounter'd him and thus I said
'Thou maiden youth be vanquish'd by a maid
but with a proud majestical high scorn
he answer'd thus Young Talbot was not born
to be the pillage of a giglot wench
so rushing in the bowels of the French
he left me proudly as unworthy fight

doubtless he would have made a noble knight
see where he lies inhearsed in the arms
of the most bloody nurser of his harms

hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder
whose life was England's glory Gallia's wonder

O no forbear for that which we have fled
during the life let us not wrong it dead

herald conduct me to the Dauphin's tent
to know who hath obtain'd the glory of the day

on what submissive message art thou sent

submission Dauphin tis a mere French word
we English warriors wot not what it means
I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en
and to survey the bodies of the dead

for prisoners ask'st thou hell our prison is
but tell me whom thou seek'st

where is the great Alcides of the field
valiant Lord Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury
created for his rare success in arms
great Earl of Washford Waterford and Valence
lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield
lord Cromwell of Wingfield Lord Furnival of Sheffield
the thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge
knight of the noble order of Saint George
worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece
great mareschal to Henry the Sixth
of all his wars within the realm of France

here is a silly stately style indeed
the Turk that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath
writes not so tedious a style as this
him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet

is Talbot slain the Frenchmen's only scourge
your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis
O were mine eye-balls into bullets turn'd
that I in rage might shoot them at your faces
O that I could but call these dead to life
it were enough to fright the realm of France
it would amaze the proudest of you all
give me their bodies that I may bear them hence
and give them burial as beseems their worth

I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost
he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
for God's sake let him have em to keep them here
they would but stink and putrefy the air

go take their bodies hence

I'll bear them hence
but from their ashes shall be rear'd
a ph nix that shall make all France afeard

so we be rid of them do with em what thou wilt
and now to Paris in this conquering vein
all will be ours now bloody Talbot's slain

the emperor and the Earl of Armagnac

I have my lord and their intent is this
they humbly sue unto your excellence
to have a godly peace concluded of
between the realms of England and of France

how doth your Grace affect their motion

well my good lord and as the only means
to stop effusion of our Christian blood
and stablish quietness on every side

ay marry uncle for I always thought
it was both impious and unnatural
that such immanity and bloody strife
should reign among professors of one faith

beside my lord the sooner to effect
the Earl of Armagnac near knit to Charles
a man of great authority in France
proffers his only daughter to your Grace
in marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry

marriage uncle alas my years are young
and fitter is my study and my books
than wanton dalliance with a paramour
yet call the ambassadors and as you please
so let them have their answers every one
I shall be well content with any choice
tends to God's glory and my country's weal

what is my Lord of Winchester install'd
and call'd unto a cardinal's degree
then I perceive that will be verified
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy
'If once he come to be a cardinal
he'll make his cap co-equal with the crown
my lords ambassadors your several suits
have been consider'd and debated on
your purpose is both good and reasonable
and therefore are we certainly resolv'd
to draw conditions of a friendly peace
which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
shall be transported presently to France

and for the proffer of my lord your master
I have inform'd his highness so at large
as liking of the lady's virtuous gifts
her beauty and the value of her dower
he doth intend she shall be England's queen

in argument and proof of which contract
bear her this jewel pledge of my affection
and so my lord protector see them guarded
and safely brought to Dover where inshipp'd
commit them to the fortune of the sea

stay my lord legate you shall first receive
the sum of money which I promised
should be deliver'd to his holiness
for clothing me in these grave ornaments

I will attend upon your lordship's leisure

now Winchester will not submit I trow
or be inferior to the proudest peer
Humphrey of Gloucester thou shalt well perceive
that neither in birth or for authority
the bishop will be overborne by thee
I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee
or sack this country with a mutiny


these news my lord may cheer our drooping spirits
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt

then march to Paris royal Charles of France
and keep not back your powers in dalliance

peace be amongst them if they turn to us
else ruin combat with their palaces


success unto our valiant general
and happiness to his accomplices

what tidings send our scouts I prithee speak

the English army that divided was
into two parties is now conjoin'd in one
and means to give you battle presently

somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is
but we will presently provide for them
I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there
now he is gone my lord you need not fear

of all base passions fear is most accurs'd
command the conquest Charles it shall be thine
let Henry fret and all the world repine

then on my lords and France be fortunate


the regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly
now help ye charming spells and periapts
and ye choice spirits that admonish me
and give me signs of future accidents

you speedy helpers that are substitutes
under the lordly monarch of the north
appear and aid me in this enterprise

this speedy and quick appearance argues proof
of your accustom'd diligence to me
now ye familiar spirits that are cull'd
out of the powerful regions under earth
help me this once that France may get the field

O hold me not with silence over-long
where I was wont to feed you with my blood
I'll lop a member off and give it you
in earnest of a further benefit
so you do condescend to help me now

no hope to have redress My body shall
pay recompense if you will grant my suit

cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
entreat you to your wonted furtherance
then take my soul my body soul and all
before that England give the French the foil
see they forsake me Now the time is come
that France must vail her lofty-plumed crest
and let her head fall into England's lap
my ancient incantations are too weak
and hell too strong for me to buckle with
now France thy glory droopeth to the dust

damsel of France I think I have you fast
unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
and try if they can gain your liberty
a goodly prize fit for the devil's grace
see how the ugly witch doth bend her brows
as if with Circe she would change my shape

chang'd to a worser shape thou canst not be

O Charles the Dauphin is a proper man
no shape but his can please your dainty eye

and may ye both be suddenly surpris'd
by bloody hands in sleeping on your beds

fell banning hag enchantress hold thy tongue

I prithee give me leave to curse a while

curse miscreant when thou comest to the stake

be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner

O fairest beauty do not fear nor fly
for I will touch thee but with reverent hands
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace
and lay them gently on thy tender side
what art thou say that I may honour thee

Margaret my name and daughter to a king
the King of Naples whosoe'er thou art
an earl I am and Suffolk am I call'd
be not offended nature's miracle
thou art allotted to be ta'en by me
so doth the swan her downy cygnets save
keeping them prisoners underneath her wings
yet if this servile usage once offend
go and be free again as Suffolk's friend

O stay I have no power to let her pass
my hand would free her but my heart says no
as plays the sun upon the glassy streams
twinkling another counterfeited beam
so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
fain would I woo her yet I dare not speak
I'll call for pen and ink and write my mind
fie De la Pole disable not thyself
hast not a tongue is she not here thy prisoner
wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight
ay beauty's princely majesty is such

say Earl of Suffolk if thy name be so
what ransom must I pay before I pass
for I perceive I am thy prisoner

how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
before thou make a trial of her love

why speak'st thou not what ransom must I pay

she's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd
she is a woman therefore to be won

wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no

fond man remember that thou hast a wife
then how can Margaret be thy paramour

I were best to leave him for he will not hear
there all is marr'd there lies a cooling card

he talks at random sure the man is mad

and yet a dispensation may be had

and yet I would that you would answer me

I'll win this Lady Margaret For whom
why for my king tush that's a wooden thing

he talks of wood it is some carpenter

yet so my fancy may be satisfied
and peace established between these realms
but there remains a scruple in that too
for though her father be the King of Naples
duke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poor
and our nobility will scorn the match
hear ye captain Are you not at leisure

it shall be so disdain they ne'er so much
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield
madam I have a secret to reveal

what though I be enthrall'd he seems a knight
and will not any way dishonour me

lady vouchsafe to listen what I say

perhaps I shall be rescu'd by the French
and then I need not crave his courtesy

sweet madam give me hearing in a cause

tush women have been captivate ere now

lady wherefore talk you so
I cry you mercy tis but quid for quo

say gentle princess would you not suppose
your bondage happy to be made a queen

to be a queen in bondage is more vile
than is a slave in base servility
for princes should be free

and so shall you
if happy England's royal king be free

why what concerns his freedom unto me

I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen
to put a golden sceptre in thy hand
and set a precious crown upon thy head
if thou wilt condescend to be my


his love

I am unworthy to be Henry's wife

no gentle madam I unworthy am
to woo so fair a dame to be his wife
and have no portion in the choice myself
how say you madam are you so content

an if my father please I am content

then call our captains and our colours forth
and madam at your father's castle walls
we'll crave a parley to confer with him

see Reignier see thy daughter prisoner

to whom
to me

Suffolk what remedy
I am a soldier and unapt to weep
or to exclaim on Fortune's fickleness

yes there is remedy enough my lord
consent and for thy honour give consent
thy daughter shall be wedded to my king
whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto
and this her easy-held imprisonment
hath gain'd thy daughter princely liberty

speaks Suffolk as he thinks

fair Margaret knows
that Suffolk doth not flatter face or feign

upon thy princely warrant I descend


and here I will expect thy coming


welcome brave earl into our territories
command in Anjou what your honour pleases

thanks Reignier happy for so sweet a child
fit to be made companion with a king
what answer makes your Grace unto my suit

since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
to be the princely bride of such a lord
upon condition I may quietly
enjoy mine own the county Maine and Anjou
free from oppression or the stroke of war
my daughter shall be Henry's if he please

and those two counties I will undertake
your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy

and I again in Henry's royal name
as deputy unto that gracious king
give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith

Reignier of France I give thee kingly thanks
because this is in traffic of a king


and yet methinks I could be well content
to be mine own attorney in this case
I'll over then to England with this news
and make this marriage to be solemniz'd
so farewell Reignier set this diamond safe
in golden palaces as it becomes

I do embrace thee as I would embrace

farewell my lord Good wishes praise and prayers
shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret


farewell sweet madam but hark you Margaret
no princely commendations to my king

such commendations as become a maid
a virgin and his servant say to him

words sweetly plac'd and modestly directed
but madam I must trouble you again
no loving token to his majesty

yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart
never yet taint with love I send the king

and this withal

that for thyself I will not so presume
to send such peevish tokens to a king


O wert thou for myself But Suffolk stay
thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth
there Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk
solicit Henry with her wondrous praise
bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
and natural graces that extinguish art
repeat their semblance often on the seas
that when thou com'st to kneel at Henry's feet
thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder


bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn


have I sought every country far and near
and now it is my chance to find thee out
must I behold thy timeless cruel death
Ah Joan sweet daughter Joan I'll die with thee

decrepit miser base ignoble wretch
I am descended of a gentler blood
thou art no father nor no friend of mine

out out My lords an please you tis not so
I did beget her all the parish knows
her mother liveth yet can testify
she was the first fruit of my bachelorship

graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage

this argues what her kind of life hath been
wicked and vile and so her death concludes

God knows thou art a collop of my flesh
and for thy sake have I shed many a tear
deny me not I prithee gentle Joan

peasant avaunt You have suborn'd this man
of purpose to obscure my noble birth

'Tis true I gave a noble to the priest
the morn that I was wedded to her mother
kneel down and take my blessing good my girl
wilt thou not stoop Now cursed be the time
of thy nativity I would the milk
thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast
had been a little ratsbane for thy sake
or else when thou didst keep my lambs a-field
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
dost thou deny thy father cursed drab
O burn her burn her hanging is too good

take her away for she hath liv'd too long
to fill the world with vicious qualities

first let me tell you whom you have condemn'd
not me begotten of a shepherd swain
but issu'd from the progeny of kings
virtuous and holy chosen from above
by inspiration of celestial grace
to work exceeding miracles on earth
I never had to do with wicked spirits
but you that are polluted with your lusts
stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents
corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
because you want the grace that others have
you judge it straight a thing impossible
to compass wonders but by help of devils
no misconceived Joan of Arc hath been
a virgin from her tender infancy
chaste and immaculate in very thought
will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven

ay ay away with her to execution

and hark ye sirs because she is a maid
spare for no fagots let there be enow
place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
that so her torture may be shortened

will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
then Joan discover thine infirmity
that warranteth by law to be thy privilege
I am with child ye bloody homicides
murder not then the fruit within my womb
although ye hale me to a violent death

now heaven forefend the holy maid with child

the greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought

she and the Dauphin have been juggling
I did imagine what would be her refuge

well go to we will have no bastards live
especially since Charles must father it

you are deceiv'd my child is none of his
it was Alen on that enjoy'd my love

Alen on that notorious Machiavel
it dies an if it had a thousand lives

O give me leave I have deluded you
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I nam'd
but Reignier King of Naples that prevail'd

a married man that's most intolerable

there were so many whom she may accuse

it's sign she hath been liberal and free

and yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
use no entreaty for it is in vain

then lead me hence with whom I leave my curse
may never glorious sun reflex his beams
upon the country where you make abode
but darkness and the gloomy shade of death
environ you till mischief and despair
drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves


break thou in pieces and consume to ashes
thou foul accursed minister of hell

lord regent I do greet your excellence
with letters of commission from the king
for know my lords the states of Christendom
mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils
have earnestly implor'd a general peace
betwixt our nation and the aspiring French
and here at hand the Dauphin and his train
approacheth to confer about some matter

is all our travail turn'd to this effect
after the slaughter of so many peers
so many captains gentlemen and soldiers
that in this quarrel have been overthrown
and sold their bodies for their country's benefit
shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
have we not lost most part of all the towns
by treason falsehood and by treachery
our great progenitors had conquered
O Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief

be patient York if we conclude a peace
it shall be with such strict and severe covenants
as little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby


since lords of England it is thus agreed
that peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France
we come to be informed by yourselves
what the conditions of that league must be

speak Winchester for boiling choler chokes
the hollow passage of my poison'd voice
by sight of these our baleful enemies

Charles and the rest it is enacted thus
that in regard King Henry gives consent
of mere compassion and of lenity
to ease your country of distressful war
you shall become true liegemen to his crown
and Charles upon-condition thou wilt swear
to pay him tribute and submit thyself
thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him
and still enjoy thy regal dignity

must he be then as shadow of himself
adorn his temples with a coronet
and yet in substance and authority
retain but privilege of a private man
this proffer is absurd and reasonless

'Tis known already that I am possess'd
with more than half the Gallian territories
and therein reverenc'd for their lawful king
shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd
detract so much from that prerogative
as to be call'd but viceroy of the whole
no lord ambassador I'll rather keep
be cast from possibility of all

insulting Charles hast thou by secret means
us'd intercession to obtain a league
and now the matter grows to compromise
stand'st thou aloof upon comparison
either accept the title thou usurp'st
of benefit proceeding from our king
and not of any challenge of desert
or we will plague thee with incessant wars

my lord you do not well in obstinacy
to cavil in the course of this contract
if once it be neglected ten to one
we shall not find like opportunity

to say the truth it is your policy
to save your subjects from such massacre
and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
and therefore take this compact of a truce
although you break it when your pleasure serves

how sayst thou Charles shall our condition stand

it shall
only reserv'd you claim no interest
in any of our towns of garrison

then swear allegiance to his majesty
as thou art knight never to disobey
nor be rebellious to the crown of England
thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England

so now dismiss your army when ye please
hang up your ensigns let your drums be still
for here we entertain a solemn peace


of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me
her virtues graced with external gifts
do breed love's settled passions in my heart
and like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
so am I driven by breath of her renown
either to suffer shipwrack or arrive
where I may have fruition of her love

tush my good lord this superficial tale
is but a preface of her worthy praise
the chief perfections of that lovely dame
had I sufficient skill to utter them
would make a volume of enticing lines
able to ravish any dull conceit
and which is more she is not so divine
so full replete with choice of all delights
but with as humble lowliness of mind
she is content to be at your command
to love and honour Henry as her lord

and otherwise will Henry ne'er presume
therefore my Lord Protector give consent
that Margaret may be England's royal queen

so should I give consent to flatter sin
you know my lord your highness is betroth'd
unto another lady of esteem
how shall we then dispense with that contract
and not deface your honour with reproach

as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
or one that at a triumph having vow'd
to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
by reason of his adversary's odds
a poor earl's daughter is unequal odds
and therefore may be broke without offence

her father is no better than an earl
although in glorious titles he excel

yes my good lord her father is a king
the King of Naples and Jerusalem
and of such great authority in France
as his alliance will confirm our peace
and keep the Frenchmen in allegiance

and so the Earl of Armagnac may do
because he is near kinsman unto Charles

beside his wealth doth warrant liberal dower
where Reignier sooner will receive than give

a dower my lords disgrace not so your king
that he should be so abject base and poor
to choose for wealth and not for perfect love
Henry is able to enrich his queen
so worthless peasants bargain for their wives
as market-men for oxen sheep or horse
marriage is a matter of more worth
than to be dealt in by attorneyship
not whom we will but whom his Grace affects
must be companion of his nuptial bed
and therefore lords since he affects her most
it most of all these reasons bindeth us
in our opinions she should be preferr'd
for what is wedlock forced but a hell
an age of discord and continual strife
whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
and is a pattern of celestial peace
whom should we match with Henry being a king
but Margaret that is daughter to a king
her peerless feature joined with her birth
approves her fit for none but for a king
her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
more than in women commonly is seen
for Henry son unto a conqueror
is likely to beget more conquerors
if with a lady of so high resolve
as is fair Margaret he be link'd in love
then yield my lords and here conclude with me
that Margaret shall be queen and none but she

whether it be through force of your report
my noble lord of Suffolk or for that
my tender youth was never yet attaint
with any passion of inflaming love
I cannot tell but this I am assur'd
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast
such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
as I am sick with working of my thoughts
take therefore shipping post my lord to France
agree to any covenants and procure
that Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
to cross the seas to England and be crown'd
for your expenses and sufficient charge
among the people gather up a tenth
be gone I say for till you do return
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares
and you good uncle banish all offence
if you do censure me by what you were
not what you are I know it will excuse
this sudden execution of my will
and so conduct me where from company
I may revolve and ruminate my grief


ay grief I fear me both at first and last


thus Suffolk hath prevail'd and thus he goes
as did the youthful Paris once to Greece
with hope to find the like event in love
but prosper better than the Trojan did
but I will rule both her the king and realm

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN

now say Chatillon what would France with us

thus after greeting speaks the King of France
in my behaviour to the majesty
the borrow'd majesty of England here

a strange beginning borrow'd majesty

silence good mother hear the embassy

Philip of France in right and true behalf
of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son
Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim
to this fair island and the territories
to Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Maine
which sways usurpingly these several titles
and put the same into young Arthur's hand
thy nephew and right royal sovereign

what follows if we disallow of this

the proud control of fierce and bloody war
to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld

here have we war for war and blood for blood
controlment for controlment so answer France

then take my king's defiance from my mouth
the furthest limit of my embassy

bear mine to him and so depart in peace
be thou as lightning in the eyes of France
for ere thou canst report I will be there
the thunder of my cannon shall be heard
and sullen presage of your own decay
an honourable conduct let him have
Pembroke look to't Farewell Chatillon


what now my son have I not ever said
how that ambitious Constance would not cease
till she had kindled France and all the world
upon the right and party of her son
this might have been prevented and made whole
with very easy arguments of love
which now the manage of two kingdoms must
with fearful bloody issue arbitrate

our strong possession and our right for us

your strong possession much more than your right
or else it must go wrong with you and me
so much my conscience whispers in your ear


my liege here is the strangest controversy
come from the country to be judg'd by you
that e'er I heard shall I produce the men

let them approach

our abbeys and our priories shall pay
this expedition's charge

what men are you

your faithful subject I a gentleman
born in Northamptonshire and eldest son
as I suppose to Robert Faulconbridge
a soldier by the honour-giving hand
of C ur-de-Lion knighted in the field


the son and heir to that same Faulconbridge

is that the elder and art thou the heir
you came not of one mother then it seems

most certain of one mother mighty king
that is well known and as I think one father
but for the certain knowledge of that truth
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother
of that I doubt as all men's children may

out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
and wound her honour with this diffidence

I madam no I have no reason for it
that is my brother's plea and none of mine
the which if he can prove a' pops me out
at least from fair five hundred pound a year

a good blunt fellow Why being younger born
doth he lay claim to thine inheritance

I know not why except to get the land
but once he slander'd me with bastardy
but whe'r I be as true-begot or no
that still I lay upon my mother's head
but that I am as well-begot my liege
fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
compare our faces and be judge yourself
if old Sir Robert did beget us both
and were our father and this son like him
O old Sir Robert father on my knee
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee

why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here

he hath a trick of C ur-de-Lion's face
do you not read some tokens of my son
in the large composition of this man

mine eye hath well examined his parts
and finds them perfect Richard Sirrah speak
what doth move you to claim your brother's land

because he hath a half-face like my father
with half that face would he have all my land
a half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year

my gracious liege when that my father liv'd
your brother did employ my father much

well sir by this you cannot get my land
your tale must be how he employ'd my mother

and once dispatch'd him in an embassy
to Germany there with the emperor
the advantage of his absence took the king
and in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's
where how he did prevail I shame to speak
but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
between my father and my mother lay
as I have heard my father speak himself
when this same lusty gentleman was got
upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
his lands to me and took it on his death
that this my mother's son was none of his
an if he were he came into the world
full fourteen weeks before the course of time
then good my liege let me have what is mine
my father's land as was my father's will

sirrah your brother is legitimate
your father's wife did after wedlock bear him
and if she did play false the fault was hers
which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
who as you say took pains to get this son
had of your father claim'd this son for his
in sooth good friend your father might have kept
this calf bred from his cow from all the world
in sooth he might then if he were my brother's
my brother might not claim him nor your father
being none of his refuse him this concludes
my mother's son did get your father's heir
your father's heir must have your father's land

shall then my father's will be of no force
to dispossess that child which is not his

of no more force to dispossess me sir
than was his will to get me as I think

whe'r hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
and like thy brother to enjoy thy land
or the reputed son of C ur-de-Lion

madam an if my brother had my shape
and I had his Sir Robert his like him
and if my legs were two such riding-rods
my arms such eel-skins stuff'd my face so thin
that in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
lest men should say Look where three-far-things goes
and to his shape were heir to all this land
would I might never stir from off this place
I'd give it every foot to have this face
I would not be Sir Nob in any case

I like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune
bequeath thy land to him and follow me
I am a soldier and now bound to France

brother take you my land I'll take my chance
your face hath got five hundred pounds a year
yet sell your face for five pence and tis dear

nay I would have you go before me thither

our country manners give our betters way

what is thy name

Philip my liege so is my name begun
Philip good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son

from henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest
kneel thou down Philip but arise more great
arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet

brother by the mother's side give me your hand
my father gave me honour yours gave land
now blessed be the hour by night or day
when I was got Sir Robert was away

I am thy grandam Richard call me so

madam by chance but not by truth what though
something about a little from the right
in at the window or else o'er the hatch
who dares not stir by day must walk by night
and have is have however men do catch
near or far off well won is still well shot
and I am I howe'er I was begot

go Faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
a landless knight makes thee a landed squire
come madam and come Richard we must speed
for France for France for it is more than need

brother adieu good fortune come to thee
for thou wast got i' the way of honesty

a foot of honour better than I was
well now can I make any Joan a lady
'Good den Sir Richard God-a-mercy fellow
and if his name be George I'll call him Peter
for new-made honour doth forget men's names
'Tis too respective and too sociable
for your conversion Now your traveller
he and his toothpick at my worship's mess
and when my knightly stomach is suffic'd
why then I suck my teeth and catechize
my picked man of countries My dear sir
thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
'I shall beseech you that is question now
and then comes answer like an absey-book
'O sir says answer at your best command
at your employment at your service sir
'No sir says question I sweet sir at yours
and so ere answer knows what question would
saving in dialogue of compliment
and talking of the Alps and Apennines
it draws toward supper in conclusion so
but this is worshipful society
and fits the mounting spirit like myself
for he is but a bastard to the time
that doth not smack of observation
and so am I whether I smack or no
and not alone in habit and device
exterior form outward accoutrement
but from the inward motion to deliver
sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth
which though I will not practise to deceive
yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn
for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
but who comes in such haste in riding-robes
what woman-post is this hath she no husband
that will take pains to blow a horn before her


O me it is my mother How now good lady
what brings you here to court so hastily

where is that slave thy brother where is he
that holds in chase mine honour up and down

my brother Robert old Sir Robert's son
Colbrand the giant that same mighty man
is it Sir Robert's son that you seek so

sir Robert's son Ay thou unreverend boy
sir Robert's son why scorn'st thou at Sir Robert
he is Sir Robert's son and so art thou

James Gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile

good leave good Philip

Philip sparrow James
there's toys abroad anon I'll tell thee more
madam I was not old Sir Robert's son
sir Robert might have eat his part in me
upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast
sir Robert could do well marry to confess
could he get me Sir Robert could not do it
we know his handiwork therefore good mother
to whom am I beholding for these limbs
sir Robert never holp to make this leg

hast thou conspired with thy brother too
that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
what means this scorn thou most untoward knave

knight knight good mother Basilisco-like
what I am dubb'd I have it on my shoulder
but mother I am not Sir Robert's son
I have disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land
legitimation name and all is gone
then good my mother let me know my father

hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge

as faithfully as I deny the devil

king Richard C ur-de-Lion was thy father
by long and vehement suit I was seduc'd
to make room for him in my husband's bed
heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
thou art the issue of my dear offence
which was so strongly urg'd past my defence

now by this light were I to get again
madam I would not wish a better father
some sins do bear their privilege on earth
and so doth yours your fault was not your folly
needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
subjected tribute to commanding love
against whose fury and unmatched force
nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand
he that perforce robs lions of their hearts
may easily win a woman's Ay my mother
with all my heart I thank thee for my father
who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
when I was got I'll send his soul to hell
come lady I will show thee to my kin
and they shall say when Richard me begot
if thou hadst said him nay it had been sin
who says it was he lies I say twas not


before Angiers well met brave Austria
Arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
Richard that robb'd the lion of his heart
and fought the holy wars in Palestine
by this brave duke came early to his grave
and for amends to his posterity
at our importance hither is he come
and to rebuke the usurpation
of thy unnatural uncle English John
embrace him love him give him welcome hither

God shall forgive you C ur-de-Lion's death
the rather that you give his offspring life
shadowing their right under your wings of war
I give you welcome with a powerless hand
but with a heart full of unstained love
welcome before the gates of Angiers duke

a noble boy Who would not do thee right

upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
as seal to this indenture of my love
that to my home I will no more return
till Angiers and the right thou hast in France
together with that pale that white-fac'd shore
whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
even till that England hedg'd in with the main
that water-walled bulwark still secure
and confident from foreign purposes
even till that utmost corner of the west
salute thee for her king till then fair boy
will I not think of home but follow arms

O take his mother's thanks a widow's thanks
till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
to make a more requital to your love

the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
in such a just and charitable war

well then to work our cannon shall be bent
against the brows of this resisting town
call for our chiefest men of discipline
to cull the plots of best advantages
we'll lay before this town our royal bones
but we will make it subject to this boy

stay for an answer to your embassy
lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood
my Lord Chatillon may from England bring
that right in peace which here we urge in war
and then we shall repent each drop of blood
that hot rash haste so indirectly shed


a wonder lady lo upon thy wish
our messenger Chatillon is arriv'd
what England says say briefly gentle lord
we coldly pause for thee Chatillon speak

then turn your forces from this paltry siege
and stir them up against a mightier task
England impatient of your just demands
hath put himself in arms the adverse winds
to land his legions all as soon as I
his marches are expedient to this town
his forces strong his soldiers confident
with him along is come the mother-queen
an Ate stirring him to blood and strife
with her her niece the Lady Blanch of Spain
with them a bastard of the king's deceas'd
and all the unsettled humours of the land
rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
with ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens
have sold their fortunes at their native homes
bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
to make a hazard of new fortunes here
in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
did never float upon the swelling tide
to do offence and scathe in Christendom

the interruption of their churlish drums
to parley or to fight therefore prepare

how much unlook'd for is this expedition

by how much unexpected by so much
we must awake endeavour for defence
for courage mounteth with occasion
let them be welcome then we are prepar'd


peace be to France if France in peace permit
our just and lineal entrance to our own
if not bleed France and peace ascend to heaven
whiles we God's wrathful agent do correct
their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven

peace be to England if that war return
from France to England there to live in peace
England we love and for that England's sake
this toil of ours should be a work of thine
but thou from loving England art so far
that thou hast under-wrought his lawful king
cut off the sequence of posterity
out-faced infant state and done a rape
upon the maiden virtue of the crown
look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face
these eyes these brows were moulded out of his
this little abstract doth contain that large
which died in Geffrey and the hand of time
shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
that Geffrey was thy elder brother born
and this his son England was Geffrey's right
and this is Geffrey's In the name of God
how comes it then that thou art call'd a king
when living blood doth in these temples beat
which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest

from whom hast thou this great commission France

from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
in any breast of strong authority
to look into the blots and stains of right
that judge hath made me guardian to this boy
under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
and by whose help I mean to chastise it

alack thou dost usurp authority

excuse it is to beat usurping down

who is it thou dost call usurper France

let me make answer thy usurping son

out insolent thy bastard shall be king
that thou mayst be a queen and check the world

as thine was to thy husband and this boy
liker in feature to his father Geffrey
than thou and John in manners being as like
as rain to water or devil to his dam
my boy a bastard By my soul I think
his father never was so true begot
it cannot be an if thou wert his mother

there's a good mother boy that blots thy father

there's a good grandam boy that would blot thee

peace

hear the crier

what the devil art thou

one that will play the devil sir with you
you are the hare of whom the proverb goes
whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
I'll smoke your skin coat an I catch you right
sirrah look to't i' faith I will i' faith

O well did he become that lion's robe
that did disrobe the lion of that robe

it lies as sightly on the back of him
as great Alcides' shows upon an ass
but ass I'll take that burden from your back
or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack

what cracker is this same that deafs our ears
with this abundance of superfluous breath
king Lewis determine what we shall do straight

women and fools break off your conference
king John this is the very sum of all
in right of Arthur do I claim of thee
wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms

my life as soon I do defy thee France
Arthur of Britaine yield thee to my hand
and out of my dear love I'll give thee more
than e'er the coward hand of France can win
submit thee boy

come to thy grandam child

do child go to it grandam child
give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
give it a plum a cherry and a fig
there's a good grandam

good my mother peace
I would that I were low laid in my grave
I am not worth this coil that's made for me
his mother shames him so poor boy he weeps

now shame upon you whe'r she does or no
his grandam's wrongs and not his mother's shames
draw those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes
which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib'd
to do him justice and revenge on you

thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth

thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
call not me slanderer thou and thine usurp
the dominations royalties and rights
of this oppressed boy this is thy eld'st son's son
infortunate in nothing but in thee
thy sins are visited in this poor child
the canon of the law is laid on him
being but the second generation

Bedlam have done

I have but this to say
that he's not only plagued for her sin
but God hath made her sin and her the plague
on this removed issue plagu'd for her
and with her plague her sin his injury
her injury the beadle to her sin
all punish'd in the person of this child
and all for her A plague upon her

thou unadvised scold I can produce
a will that bars the title of thy son

ay who doubts that a will a wicked will
a woman's will a canker'd grandam's will

peace lady pause or be more temperate
to these ill-tuned repetitions
some trumpet summon hither to the walls
these men of Angiers let us hear them speak
whose title they admit Arthur's or John's


who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls

'Tis France for England

England for itself
you men of Angiers and my loving subjects

you loving men of Angiers Arthur's subjects
our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle

for our advantage therefore hear us first
these flags of France that are advanced here
before the eye and prospect of your town
the cannons have their bowels full of wrath
and ready mounted are they to spit forth
their iron indignation gainst your walls
all preparation for a bloody siege
and merciless proceeding by these French
confronts your city's eyes your winking gates
and but for our approach those sleeping stones
that as a waist do girdle you about
by the compulsion of their ordinance
by this time from their fixed beds of lime
had been dishabited and wide havoc made
for bloody power to rush upon your peace
but on the sight of us your lawful king
who painfully with much expedient march
have brought a countercheck before your gates
to save unscratch'd your city's threaten'd cheeks
behold the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle
and now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire
to make a shaking fever in your walls
to make a faithless error in your ears
which trust accordingly kind citizens
and let us in your king whose labour'd spirits
forwearied in this action of swift speed
crave harbourage within your city walls

when I have said make answer to us both
lo in this right hand whose protection
is most divinely vow'd upon the right
of him it holds stands young Plantagenet
son to the elder brother of this man
and king o'er him and all that he enjoys
for this down-trodden equity we tread
in war-like march these greens before your town
being no further enemy to you
than the constraint of hospitable zeal
in the relief of this oppressed child
religiously provokes Be pleased then
to pay that duty which you truly owe
and then our arms like to a muzzled bear
save in aspect have all offence seal'd up
our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
against the invulnerable clouds of heaven
and with a blessed and unvex'd retire
with unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd
we will bear home that lusty blood again
which here we came to spout against your town
and leave your children wives and you in peace
but if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls
can hide you from our messengers of war
though all these English and their discipline
were harbour'd in their rude circumference
then tell us shall your city call us lord
in that behalf which we have challeng'd it
or shall we give the signal to our rage
and stalk in blood to our possession

for him and in his right we hold this town

acknowledge then the king and let me in

that can we not but he that proves the king
to him will we prove loyal till that time
have we ramm'd up our gates against the world

doth not the crown of England prove the king
and if not that I bring you witnesses
twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed

bastards and else

to verify our title with their lives

as many and as well-born bloods as those

some bastards too
stand in his face to contradict his claim

till thou compound whose right is worthiest
we for the worthiest hold the right from both

then God forgive the sins of all those souls
that to their everlasting residence
before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
in dreadful trial of our kingdom's king

amen Amen Mount chevaliers to arms

Saint George that swing'd the dragon and e'er since
sits on his horse back at mine hostess' door
teach us some fence

sirrah were I at home
at your den sirrah with your lioness
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide

peace no more

O tremble for you hear the lion roar

up higher to the plain where we'll set forth
in best appointment all our regiments

speed then to take advantage of the field

it shall be so

and at the other hill
command the rest to stand God and our right

you men of Angiers open wide your gates
and let young Arthur Duke of Britaine in
who by the hand of France this day hath made
much work for tears in many an English mother
many a widow's husband grovelling lies
coldly embracing the discolour'd earth
and victory with little loss doth play
upon the dancing banners of the French
who are at hand triumphantly display'd
to enter conquerors and to proclaim
Arthur of Britaine England's king and yours


rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells
king John your king and England's doth approach
commander of this hot malicious day
their armours that march'd hence so silver-bright
hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood
there stuck no plume in any English crest
that is removed by a staff of France
our colours do return in those same hands
that did display them when we first march'd forth
and like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes
open your gates and give the victors way

heralds from off our towers we might behold
from first to last the onset and retire
of both your armies whose equality
by our best eyes cannot be censured
blood hath bought blood and blows have answer'd blows
strength match'd with strength and power confronted power
both are alike and both alike we like
one must prove greatest while they weigh so even
we hold our town for neither yet for both


France hast thou yet more blood to cast away
say shall the current of our right run on
whose passage vex'd with thy impediment
shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
with course disturb'd even thy conflning shores
a peaceful progress to the ocean

England thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
in this hot trial more than we of France
rather lost more and by this hand I swear
that sways the earth this climate overlooks
before we will lay down our just-borne arms
we'll put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
or add a royal number to the dead
gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
with slaughter coupled to the name of kings

ha majesty how high thy glory towers
when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel
the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
in undetermin'd differences of kings
why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
you equal-potents fiery-kindled spirits
then let confusion of one part confirm
the other's peace till then blows blood and death

whose party do the townsmen yet admit

speak citizens for England who's your king

the King of England when we know the king

know him in us that here hold up his right

in us that are our own great deputy
and bear possession of our person here
lord of our presence Angiers and of you

a greater power than we denies all this
and till it be undoubted we do lock
our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates
be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd

by heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings
and stand securely on their battlements
as in a theatre whence they gape and point
at your industrious scenes and acts of death
your royal presences be rul'd by me
do like the mutines of Jerusalem
be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
by east and west let France and England mount
their battering cannon charged to the mouths
till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
I'd play incessantly upon these jades
even till unfenced desolation
leave them as naked as the vulgar air
that done dissever your united strengths
and part your mingled colours once again
then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
out of one side her happy minion
to whom in favour she shall give the day
and kiss him with a glorious victory
how like you this wild counsel mighty states
smacks it not something of the policy

now by the sky that hangs above our heads
I like it well France shall we knit our powers
and lay this Angiers even with the ground
then after fight who shall be king of it

an if thou hast the mettle of a king
being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town
turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
as we will ours against these saucy walls
and when that we have dash'd them to the ground
why then defy each other and pell-mell
make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
let it be so Say where will you assault

we from the west will send destruction
into this city's bosom

I from the north

our thunder from the south
shall rain their drift of bullets on this town

O prudent discipline From north to south
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth
I'll stir them to it Come away away

hear us great kings vouchsafe a while to stay
and I shall show you peace and fair-fac'd league
win you this city without stroke or wound
rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
that here come sacrifices for the field

speak on with favour we are bent to hear

that daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch
is near to England look upon the years
of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid
if lusty love should go in quest of beauty
where should he find it fairer than in Blanch
if zealous love should go in search of virtue
where should he find it purer than in Blanch
if love ambitious sought a match of birth
whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch
such as she is in beauty virtue birth
is the young Dauphin every way complete
if not complete of say he is not she
and she again wants nothing to name want
if want it be not that she is not he
he is the half part of a blessed man
left to be finished by such a she
whose fulness of perfection lies in him
O two such silver currents when they join
do glorify the banks that bound them in
and two such shores to two such streams made one
two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
to these two princes if you marry them
this union shall do more than battery can
to our fast-closed gates for at this match
with swifter spleen than powder can enforce
the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
and give you entrance but without this match
the sea enraged is not half so deaf
lions more confident mountains and rocks
more free from motion no not death himself
in mortal fury half so peremptory
as we to keep this city

here's a stay
that shakes the rotten carcase of old Death
that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
talks as familiarly of roaring lions
as maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs
what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce
he gives the bastinado with his tongue
our ears are cudgell'd not a word of his
but buffets better than a fist of France
'Zounds I was never so bethump'd with words
since I first call'd my brother's father dad

son list to this conjunction make this match
give with our niece a dowry large enough
for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown
that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
I see a yielding in the looks of France
mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
of soft petitions pity and remorse
cool and congeal again to what it was

why answer not the double majesties
this friendly treaty of our threaten'd town

speak England first that hath been forward first
to speak unto this city what say you

if that the Dauphin there thy princely son
can in this book of beauty read I love
her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
for Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers
and all that we upon this side the sea
except this city now by us besieg'd
find liable to our crown and dignity
shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
in titles honours and promotions
holds hand with any princess of the world

what sayst thou boy look in the lady's face

I do my lord and in her eye I find
a wonder or a wondrous miracle
the shadow of myself form'd in her eye
which being but the shadow of your son
becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
I do protest I never lov'd myself
till now infixed I beheld myself
drawn in the flattering table of her eye


drawn in the flattering table of her eye
hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
and quarter'd in her heart he doth espy
himself love's traitor this is pity now
that hang'd and drawn and quarter'd there should be

my uncle's will in this respect is mine
if he see aught in you that makes him like
that anything he sees which moves his liking
I can with ease translate it to my will
or if you will to speak more properly
I will enforce it easily to my love
further I will not flatter you my lord
that all I see in you is worthy love
than this that nothing do I see in you
though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
that I can find should merit any hate

what say these young ones What say you my niece

that she is bound in honour still to do
what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say

speak then Prince Dauphin can you love this lady
nay ask me if I can refrain from love
for I do love her most unfeignedly

then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine
Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces
with her to thee and this addition more
full thirty thousand marks of English coin
Philip of France if thou be pleas'd withal
command thy son and daughter to join hands

it likes us well Young princes close your hands

and your lips too for I am well assur'd
that I did so when I was first assur'd

now citizens of Angiers ope your gates
let in that amity which you have made
for at Saint Mary's chapel presently
the rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd
I know she is not for this match made up
her presence would have interrupted much
where is she and her son tell me who knows

she is sad and passionate at your highness' tent

and by my faith this league that we have made
will give her sadness very little cure
brother of England how may we content
this widow lady In her right we came
which we God knows have turn'd another way
to our own vantage

we will heal up all
for we'll create young Arthur Duke of Britaine
and Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town
we make him lord of Call the Lady Constance
some speedy messenger bid her repair
to our solemnity I trust we shall
yet in some measure satisfy her so
that we shall stop her exclamation
go we as well as haste will suffer us
to this unlook'd-for unprepared pomp


mad world mad kings mad composition
John to stop Arthur's title in the whole
hath willingly departed with a part
and France whose armour conscience buckled on
whom zeal and charity brought to the field
as God's own soldier rounded in the ear
with that same purpose-changer that sly devil
that broker that still breaks the pate of faith
that daily break-vow he that wins of all
of kings of beggars old men young men maids
who having no external thing to lose
but the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
that smooth-fac'd gentleman tickling Commodity
the world who of itself is peized well
made to run even upon even ground
till this advantage this vile-drawing bias
this sway of motion this Commodity
makes it take head from all indifferency
from all direction purpose course intent
and this same bias this Commodity
this bawd this broker this all-changing word
clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France
hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid
from a resolv'd and honourable war
to a most base and vile-concluded peace
and why rail I on this Commodity
but for because he hath not woo'd me yet
not that I have the power to clutch my hand
when his fair angels would salute my palm
but for my hand as unattempted yet
like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
well whiles I am a beggar I will rail
and being rich my virtue then shall be
to say there is no vice but beggary
since kings break faith upon Commodity
gain be my lord for I will worship thee

gone to be married gone to swear a peace
false blood to false blood join'd gone to be friends
shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces
it is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
be well advis'd tell o'er thy tale again
it cannot be thou dost but say tis so
I trust I may not trust thee for thy word
is but the vain breath of a common man
believe me I do not believe thee man
I have a king's oath to the contrary
thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me
for I am sick and capable of fears
oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
a widow husbandless subject to fears
and though thou now confess thou didst but jest
with my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce
but they will quake and tremble all this day
what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
why dost thou look so sadly on my son
what means that hand upon that breast of thine
why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
like a proud river peering o'er his bounds
be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
then speak again not all thy former tale
but this one word whether thy tale be true

as true as I believe you think them false
that give you cause to prove my saying true

O if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
and let belief and life encounter so
as doth the fury of two desperate men
Lewis marry Blanch O boy then where art thou
France friend with England what becomes of me
fellow be gone I cannot brook thy sight
this news hath made thee a most ugly man

what other harm have I good lady done
but spoke the harm that is by others done

which harm within itself so heinous is
as it makes harmful all that speak of it

I do beseech you madam be content

if thou that bidd'st me be content wert grim
ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb
full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks
I would not care I then would be content
become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great
of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
and with the half-blown rose But Fortune O
she is corrupted chang'd and won from thee
she adulterates hourly with thine uncle John
and with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
to tread down fair respect of sovereignty
and made his majesty the bawd to theirs
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John
that strumpet Fortune that usurping John
tell me thou fellow is not France forsworn
envenom him with words or get thee gone
and leave those woes alone which I alone
am bound to underbear

pardon me madam
I may not go without you to the kings
thou mayst thou shalt I will not go with thee
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud
for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
to me and to the state of my great grief
let kings assemble for my grief's so great
that no supporter but the huge firm earth
can hold it up here I and sorrows sit
here is my throne bid kings come bow to it

'Tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
ever in France shall be kept festival
to solemnize this day the glorious sun
stays in his course and plays the alchemist
turning with splendour of his precious eye
the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
the yearly course that brings this day about
shall never see it but a holiday

a wicked day and not a holy day
that it in golden letters should be set
among the high tides in the calendar
nay rather turn this day out of the week
this day of shame oppression perjury
or if it must stand still let wives with child
pray that their burdens may not fall this day
lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd
but on this day let seamen fear no wrack
no bargains break that are not this day made
this day all things begun come to ill end
yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change

by heaven lady you shall have no cause
to curse the fair proceedings of this day
have I not pawn'd to you my majesty

you have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried
proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
but now in arms you strengthen it with yours
the grappling vigour and rough frown of war
is cold in amity and painted peace
and our oppression hath made up this league
arm arm you heavens against these perjur'd kings
a widow cries be husband to me heavens
let not the hours of this ungodly day
wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
set armed discord twixt these perjur'd kings
hear me O hear me

lady Constance peace

war war no peace peace is to me a war
O Lymoges O Austria thou dost shame
that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward
thou little valiant great in villany
thou ever strong upon the stronger side
thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
to teach thee safety thou art perjur'd too
and sooth'st up greatness What a fool art thou
a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
upon my party Thou cold-blooded slave
hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
and dost thou now fall over to my foes
thou wear a hon's hide doff it for shame
and hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs

O that a man should speak those words to me

and hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs

thou dar'st not say so villain for thy life

and hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs



here comes the holy legate of the pope

hail you anointed deputies of heaven
to thee King John my holy errand is
I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal
and from Pope Innocent the legate here
do in his name religiously demand
why thou against the church our holy mother
so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
keep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop
of Canterbury from that holy see
this in our foresaid holy father's name
pope Innocent I do demand of thee

what earthly name to interrogatories
can task the free breath of a sacred king
thou canst not cardinal devise a name
to charge me to an answer as the pope
tell him this tale and from the mouth of England
add thus much more that no Italian priest
shall tithe or toll in our dominions
but as we under heaven are supreme head
so under him that great supremacy
where we do reign we will alone uphold
without the assistance of a mortal hand
so tell the pope all reverence set apart
to him and his usurp'd authority

brother of England you blaspheme in this

though you and all the kings of Christendom
are led so grossly by this meddling priest
dreading the curse that money may buy out
and by the merit of vile gold dross dust
purchase corrupted pardon of a man
who in that sale sells pardon from himself
this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
yet I alone alone do me oppose
against the pope and count his friends my foes

then by the lawful power that I have
thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate
and blessed shall he be that doth revolt
from his allegiance to a heretic
and meritorious shall that hand be call'd
canonized and worshipp'd as a saint
that takes away by any secret course
thy hateful life

O lawful let it be
that I have room with Rome to curse awhile
good father cardinal cry thou amen
to my keen curses for without my wrong
there is no tongue hath power to curse him right


and for mine too when law can do no right
let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
law cannot give my child his kingdom here
for he that holds his kingdom holds the law
therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
how can the law forbid my tongue to curse

Philip of France on peril of a curse
let go the hand of that arch-heretic
and raise the power of France upon his head
unless he do submit himself to Rome

look'st thou pale France do not let go thy hand

look to that devil lest that France repent
and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul

king Philip listen to the cardinal
and hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs

well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs
because

your breeches best may carry them

Philip what sayst thou to the cardinal

what should he say but as the cardinal

bethink you father for the difference
is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
or the light loss of England for a friend
forego the easier

that's the curse of Rome

O Lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here

the Lady Constance speaks not from her faith
but from her need

O if thou grant my need
which only lives but by the death of faith
that need must needs infer this principle
that faith would live again by death of need
O then tread down my need and faith mounts up
keep my need up and faith is trodden down

the king is mov'd and answers not to this

O be remov'd from him and answer well

do so King Philip hang no more in doubt

hang nothing but a calf's-skin most sweet lout


what canst thou say but will perplex thee more
if thou stand excommunicate and curs'd

good reverend father make my person yours
and tell me how you would bestow yourself
this royal hand and mine are newly knit
and the conjunction of our inward souls
married in league coupled and link'd together
with all religious strength of sacred vows
the latest breath that gave the sound of words
was deep-sworn faith peace amity true love
between our kingdoms and our royal selves
and even before this truce but new before
no longer than we well could wash our hands
to clap this royal bargain up of peace
heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstain'd
with slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint
the fearful difference of incensed kings
so newly join'd in love so strong in both
unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
make such unconstant children of ourselves
as now again to snatch our palm from palm
unswear faith sworn and on the marriage-bed
of smiling peace to march a bloody host
and make a riot on the gentle brow
of true sincerity O holy sir
my reverend father let it not be so
out of your grace devise ordain impose
some gentle order and then we shall be bless'd
to do your pleasure and continue friends

all form is formless order orderless
save what is opposite to England's love
therefore to arms be champion of our church
or let the church our mother breathe her curse
a mother's curse on her revolting son
a chafed lion by the mortal paw
a fasting tiger safer by the tooth
than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold

I may disjoin my hand but not my faith

so mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith
and like a civil war sett'st oath to oath
thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow
first made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd
that is to be the champion of our church
what since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
and may not be performed by thyself
for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
is not amiss when it is truly done
and being not done where doing tends to ill
the truth is then most done not doing it
the better act of purposes mistook
is to mistake again though indirect
and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire
within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd
it is religion that doth make vows kept
but thou hast sworn against religion
by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st
and mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth
against an oath the truth thou art unsure
to swear swears only not to be forsworn
else what a mockery should it be to swear
but thou dost swear only to be forsworn
and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
therefore thy later vows against thy first
is in thyself rebellion to thyself
and better conquest never canst thou make
than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
against these giddy loose suggestions
upon which better part our prayers come in
if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know
the peril of our curses light on thee
but in despair die under their black weight

rebellion flat rebellion

will't not be
will not a calf's-skin stop that mouth of thine

father to arms

upon thy wedding-day
against the blood that thou hast married
what shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men
shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
O husband hear me ay alack how new
is husband in my mouth even for that name
which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce
upon my knee I beg go not to arms
against mine uncle
O upon my knee
made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee
thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom
forethought by heaven

now shall I see thy love what motive may
be stronger with thee than the name of wife

that which upholdeth him that thee upholds
his honour O thine honour Lewis thine honour

I muse your majesty doth seem so cold
when such profound respects do pull you on

I will denounce a curse upon his head

thou shalt not need England I'll fall from thee

O fair return of banish'd majesty
O foul revolt of French inconstancy

France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour

old Time the clock-setter that bald sexton Time
is it as he will well then France shall rue

the sun's o'ercast with blood fair day adieu
which is the side that I must go withal
I am with both each army hath a hand
and in their rage I having hold of both
they whirl asunder and dismember me
husband I cannot pray that thou mayst win
uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose
father I may not wish the fortune thine
grandam I will not wish thy wishes thrive
whoever wins on that side shall I lose
assured loss before the match be play'd


there where my fortune lives there my life dies

cousin go draw our puissance together

France I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath
a rage whose heat hath this condition
that nothing can allay nothing but blood
the blood and dearest-valu'd blood of France

thy rage shall burn thee up and thou shalt turn
to ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
look to thyself thou art in jeopardy

no more than he that threats To arms let's hie


now by my life this day grows wondrous hot
some airy devil hovers in the sky
while Philip breathes


Hubert keep this boy Philip make up
my mother is assailed in our tent
and ta'en I fear

my lord I rescu'd her
her highness is in safety fear you not
but on my liege for very little pains
will bring this labour to a happy end


so shall it be your grace shall stay behind
so strongly guarded

cousin look not sad
thy grandam loves thee and thy uncle will
as dear be to thee as thy father was
O this will make my mother die with grief

cousin away for England haste before
and ere our coming see thou shake the bags
of hoarding abbots set at liberty
imprison'd angels the fat ribs of peace
must by the hungry now be fed upon
use our commission in his utmost force

bell book and candle shall not drive me back
when gold and silver becks me to come on
I leave your highness Grandam I will pray
if ever I remember to be holy
for your fair safety so I kiss your hand

farewell gentle cousin

coz farewell

come hither little kinsman hark a word


come hither Hubert O my gentle Hubert
we owe thee much within this wall of flesh
there is a soul counts thee her creditor
and with advantage means to pay thy love
and my good friend thy voluntary oath
lives in this bosom dearly cherished
give me thy hand I had a thing to say
but I will fit it with some better time
by heaven Hubert I am almost asham'd
to say what good respect I have of thee

I am much bounden to your majesty

good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
but thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow
yet it shall come for me to do thee good
the sun is in the heaven and the proud day
attended with the pleasures of the world
is all too wanton and too full of gawds
to give me audience if the midnight bell
did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
sound one into the drowsy race of night
if this same were a churchyard where we stand
and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
or if that surly spirit melancholy
had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy-thick
which else runs tickling up and down the veins
making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes
and strain their cheeks to idle merriment
a passion hateful to my purposes
or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
hear me without thine ears and make reply
without a tongue using conceit alone
without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
then in despite of brooded watchful day
but ah I will not yet I love thee well
and by my troth I think thou lov'st me well

so well that what you bid me undertake
though that my death were adjunct to my act
by heaven I would do it

do not I know thou wouldst
good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye
on yon young boy I'll tell thee what my friend
he is a very serpent in my way
and wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread
he lies before me dost thou understand me
thou art his keeper

and I'll keep him so
that he shall not offend your majesty

death
my lord

a grave

he shall not live

enough
I could be merry now Hubert I love thee
well I'll not say what I intend for thee
remember Madam fare you well
I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty

my blessing go with thee

for England cousin go
Hubert shall be your man attend on you
with all true duty On toward Calais ho


a whole armado of convicted sail
is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship

courage and comfort all shall yet go well

what can go well when we have run so ill
are we not beaten Is not Angiers lost
Arthur ta'en prisoner divers dear friends slain
and bloody England into England gone
o'erbearing interruption spite of France

what he hath won that hath he fortified
so hot a speed with such advice dispos'd
such temperate order in so fierce a cause
doth want example who hath read or heard
of any kindred action like to this

well could I bear that England had this praise
so we could find some pattern of our shame

look who comes here a grave unto a soul
holding the eternal spirit against her will
in the vile prison of afflicted breath

I prithee lady go away with me

lo now now see the issue of your peace

patience good lady comfort gentle Constance

no I defy all counsel all redress
but that which ends all counsel true redress
death death O amiable lovely death
thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness
arise forth from the couch of lasting night
thou hate and terror to prosperity
and I will kiss thy detestable bones
and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
and be a carrion monster like thyself
come grin on me and I will think thou smil'st
and buss thee as thy wife Misery's love
O come to me

O fair affliction peace

no no I will not having breath to cry
O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth
then with a passion would I shake the world
and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice
which scorns a modern invocation

lady you utter madness and not sorrow

thou art not holy to belie me so
I am not mad this hair I tear is mine
young Arthur is my son and he is lost
I am not mad I would to heaven I were
for then tis like I should forget myself
O if I could what grief should I forget
preach some philosophy to make me mad
and thou shalt be canoniz'd cardinal
for being not mad but sensible of grief
my reasonable part produces reason
how I may be deliver'd of these woes
and teaches me to kill or hang myself
if I were mad I should forget my son
or madly think a babe of clouts were he
I am not mad too well too well I feel
the different plague of each calamity

bind up those tresses O what love I note
in the fair multitude of those her hairs
where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen
even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
like true inseparable faithful loves
sticking together in calamity

to England if you will

bind up your hairs

yes that I will and wherefore will I do it
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
'O that these hands could so redeem my son
as they have given these hairs their liberty
but now I envy at their liberty
and will again commit them to their bonds
because my poor child is a prisoner
and father cardinal I have heard you say
that we shall see and know our friends in heaven
if that be true I shall see my boy again
for since the birth of Cain the first male child
to him that did but yesterday suspire
but now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
and chase the native beauty from his cheek
and he will look as hollow as a ghost
as dim and meagre as an ague's fit
and so he'll die and rising so again
when I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him therefore never never
must I behold my pretty Arthur more

you hold too heinous a respect of grief

he talks to me that never had a son

you are as fond of grief as of your child

grief fills the room up of my absent child
lies in his bed walks up and down with me
puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
remembers me of all his gracious parts
then have I reason to be fond of grief
fare you well had you such a loss as I
I could give better comfort than you do
I will not keep this form upon my head
when there is such disorder in my wit
O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son
my life my joy my food my all the world
my widow-comfort and my sorrows' cure


I fear some outrage and I'll follow her


there's nothing in this world can make me joy
life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
and bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
that it yields nought but shame and bitterness

even in the instant of repair and health
the fit is strongest evils that take leave
on their departure most of all show evil
what have you lost by losing of this day

all days of glory joy and happiness

if you had won it certainly you had
no no when Fortune means to men most good
she looks upon them with a threatening eye
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
in this which he accounts so clearly won
are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner

as heartily as he is glad he hath him

your mind is all as youthful as your blood
now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
for even the breath of what I mean to speak
out of the path which shall directly lead
thy foot to England's throne and therefore mark
John hath seiz'd Arthur and it cannot be
that whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins
the misplac'd John should entertain an hour
one minute nay one quiet breath of rest
a sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd
and he that stands upon a slippery place
makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
that John may stand then Arthur needs must fall
so be it for it cannot be but so

but what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall

you in the right of Lady Blanch your wife
may then make all the claim that Arthur did

and lose it life and all as Arthur did
how green you are and fresh in this old world
John lays you plots the times conspire with you
for he that steeps his safety in true blood
shall find but bloody safety and untrue
this act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
of all his people and freeze up their zeal
that none so small advantage shall step forth
to check his reign but they will cherish it
no natural exhalation in the sky
no scope of nature no distemper'd day
no common wind no customed event
but they will pluck away his natural cause
and call them meteors prodigies and signs
abortives presages and tongues of heaven
plainly denouncing vengeance upon John

may be he will not touch young Arthur's life
but hold himself safe in his prisonment

if that young Arthur be not gone already
even at that news he dies and then the hearts
of all his people shall revolt from him
and kiss the lips of unacquainted change
and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
out of the bloody fingers' ends of John
methinks I see this hurly all on foot
and O what better matter breeds for you
than I have nam'd The bastard Faulconbridge
is now in England ransacking the church
offending charity if but a dozen French
were there in arms they would be as a call
to train ten thousand English to their side
or as a little snow tumbled about
anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin
go with me to the king Tis wonderful
what may be wrought out of their discontent
now that their souls are topful of offence
for England go I will whet on the king
strong reasons make strong actions Let us go
if you say ay the king will not say no

heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
within the arras when I strike my foot
upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
and bind the boy which you shall find with me
fast to the chair be heedful Hence and watch

I hope your warrant will bear out the deed

uncleanly scruples fear not you look to't

young lad come forth I have to say with you


good morrow Hubert

good morrow little prince
as little prince having so great a title
to be more prince as may be You are sad

indeed I have been merrier

mercy on me
methinks nobody should be sad but I
yet I remember when I was in France
young gentlemen would be as sad as night
only for wantonness By my christendom
so I were out of prison and kept sheep
I should be as merry as the day is long
and so I would be here but that I doubt
my uncle practises more harm to me
he is afraid of me and I of him
is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son
no indeed is't not and I would to heaven
I were your son so you would love me Hubert

he will awake my mercy which lies dead
therefore I will be sudden and dispatch

are you sick Hubert you look pale to-day
in sooth I would you were a little sick
that I might sit all night and watch with you
I warrant I love you more than you do me

his words do take possession of my bosom
read here young Arthur

how now foolish rheum
turning dispiteous torture out of door
I must be brief lest resolution drop
out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
can you not read it is it not fair writ

too fairly Hubert for so foul effect
must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
young boy I must

and will you

and I will

have you the heart When your head did but ache
I knit my handkercher about your brows
the best I had a princess wrought it me
and I did never ask it you again
and with my hand at midnight held your head
and like the watchful minutes to the hour
still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time
saying What lack you and Where lies your grief
or What good love may I perform for you
many a poor man's son would have lain still
and ne'er have spoke a loving word to you
but you at your sick-service had a prince
nay you may think my love was crafty love
if heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill
why then you must Will you put out mine eyes
these eyes that never did nor never shall
so much as frown on you

I have sworn to do it
and with hot irons must I burn them out

Ah none but in this iron age would do it
the iron of itself though heat red-hot
approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
and quench this fiery indignation
even in the matter of mine innocence
nay after that consume away in rust
but for containing fire to harm mine eye
are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron
an if an angel should have come to me
and told me Hubert should put out mine eyes
I would not have believ'd him no tongue but Hubert's
come forth

do as I bid you do

O save me Hubert save me my eyes are out
even with the fierce looks of these bloody men

give me the iron I say and bind him here

alas what need you be so boisterousrough
I will not struggle I will stand stone-still
for heaven's sake Hubert let me not be bound
nay hear me Hubert drive these men away
and I will sit as quiet as a lamb
I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
nor look upon the iron angerly
thrust but these men away and I'll forgive you
whatever torment you do put me to


I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed


alas I then have chid away my friend
he hath a stern look but a gentle heart
let him come back that his compassion may
give life to yours

come boy prepare yourself

is there no remedy

none but to lose your eyes

O heaven that there were but a mote in yours
a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
any annoyance in that precious sense
then feeling what small things are boisterous there

is this your promise go to hold your tongue

Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert
or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue
so I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes
though to no use but still to look on you
lo by my troth the instrument is cold
and would not harm me

I can heat it boy

no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
being create for comfort to be us'd
in undeserv'd extremes see else yourself
there is no malice in this burning coal
the breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out

but with my breath I can revive it boy

an if you do you will but make it blush
and glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert
nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
and like a dog that is compell'd to fight
snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
all things that you should use to do me wrong
deny their office only you do lack
that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses

well see to live I will not touch thine eyes
for all the treasure that thine uncle owes
yet am I sworn and I did purpose boy
with this same very iron to burn them out

O now you look like Hubert all this while

peace no more Adieu
your uncle must not know but you are dead
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports
and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
that Hubert for the wealth of all the world
will not offend thee

O heaven I thank you Hubert

silence no more go closely in with me
much danger do I undergo for thee


here once again we sit once again crown'd
and look'd upon I hope with cheerful eyes

this once again but that your highness pleas'd
was once superfluous you were crown'd before
the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt
fresh expectation troubled not the land
with any long'd-for change or better state

therefore to be possess'd with double pomp
to guard a title that was rich before
to gild refined gold to paint the lily
to throw a perfume on the violet
to smooth the ice or add another hue
unto the rainbow or with taper-light
to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
is wasteful and ridiculous excess

but that your royal pleasure must be done
this act is as an ancient tale new told
and in the last repeating troublesome
being urged at a time unseasonable

in this the antique and well-noted face
and like a shifted wind unto a sail
it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
startles and frights consideration
makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
for putting on so new a fashion'd robe

when workmen strive to do better than well
they do confound their skill in covetousness
and oftentimes excusing of a fault
doth make the fault the worse by the excuse
as patches set upon a little breach
discredit more in hiding of the fault
than did the fault before it was so patch'd

to this effect before you were newcrown'd
we breath'd our counsel but it pleas'd your highness
to overbear it and we are all well pleas'd
since all and every part of what we would
doth make a stand at what your highness will
some reasons of this double coronation
I have possess'd you with and think them strong
and more more strong when lesser is my fear
I shall indue you with meantime but ask
what you would have reform'd that is not well
and well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your requests

then I as one that am the tongue of these
to sound the purposes of all their hearts
both for myself and them but chief of all
your safety for the which myself and them
bend their best studies heartily request
the enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint
doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
to break into this dangerous argument
if what in rest you have in right you hold
why then your fears which as they say attend
the steps of wrong should move you to mew up
with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
the rich advantage of good exercise
that the time's enemies may not have this
to grace occasions let it be our suit
that you have bid us ask his liberty
which for our goods we do no further ask
than whereupon our weal on you depending
counts it your weal he have his liberty


let it be so I do commit his youth
to your direction Hubert what news with you


this is the man should do the bloody deed
he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine
the image of a wicked hemous fault
lives in his eye that close aspect of his
does show the mood of a much troubled breast
what we so fear'd he had a charge to do

the colour of the king doth come and go
between his purpose and his conscience
like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
his passion is so ripe it needs must break

and when it breaks I fear will issue thence
the foul corruption of a sweet child's death

we cannot hold mortality's strong hand
good lords although my will to give is living
the suit which you demand is gone and dead
he tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night

indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure

indeed we heard how near his death he was
before the child himself felt he was sick

why do you bend such solemn brows on me
think you I bear the shears of destiny
have I commandment on the pulse of life

it is apparent foul play and tis shame
that greatness should so grossly offer it
so thrive it in your game and so farewell

stay yet Lord Salisbury I'll go with thee
and find the inheritance of this poor child
his little kingdom of a forced grave
that blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle
three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
this must not be thus borne this will break out
to all our sorrows and ere long I doubt


they burn in indignation I repent
no certain life achiev'd by others' death


a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
that I have seen inhabit in those cheeks
so foul a sky clears not without a storm

pour down thy weather how goes all in France

from France to England Never such a power
for any foreign preparation
was levied in the body of a land
the copy of your speed is learn'd by them
for when you should be told they do prepare
the tidings come that they are all arriv'd

O where hath our intelligence been drunk
where hath it slept Where is my mother's care
that such an army could be drawn in France

my liege her ear
is stopp'd with dust the first of April died
your noble mother and as I hear my lord
the Lady Constance in a frenzy died
three days before but this from rumour's tongue
I idly heard if true or false I know not

withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
O make a league with me till I have pleas'd
my discontented peers What mother dead
how wildly then walks my estate in France
under whose conduct came those powers of France
that thou for truth giv'st out are landed here

under the Dauphin

thou hast made me giddy
with these ill tidings

now what says the world
to your proceedings do not seek to stuff

my head with more ill news for it is full

but if you be afeard to hear the worst
then let the worst unheard fall on your head

bear with me cousin for I was amaz'd
under the tide but now I breathe again
aloft the flood and can give audience
to any tongue speak it of what it will

how I have sped among the clergymen
the sums I have collected shall express
but as I travell'd hither through the land
I find the people strangely fantasied
possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams
and here's a prophet that I brought with me
from forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found
with many hundreds treading on his heels
to whom he sung in rude harsh-sounding rimes
that ere the next Ascension-day at noon
your highness should deliver up your crown

thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so

foreknowing that the truth will fall out so

Hubert away with him imprison him
and on that day at noon whereon he says
I shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd
deliver him to safety and return
for I must use thee

O my gentle cousin
hear'st thou the news abroad who are arriv'd
the French my lord men's mouths are full of it
besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury
with eyes as red as new-enkindled fire
and others more going to seek the grave
of Arthur whom they say is kill'd to-night
on your suggestion

gentle kinsman go
and thrust thyself into their companies
I have a way to win their loves again
bring them before me

I will seek them out

nay but make haste the better foot before
O let me have no subject enemies
when adverse foreigners affright my towns
with dreadful pomp of stout invasion
be Mercury set feathers to thy heels

the spirit of the time shall teach me speed

spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman

go after him for he perhaps shall need
some messenger betwixt me and the peers
and be thou he

with all my heart my liege


my mother dead


my lord they say five moons were seen to-night
four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
the other four in wondrous motion


old men and beldams in the streets
do prophesy upon it dangerously
young Arthur's death is common in their mouths
and when they talk of him they shake their heads
and whisper one another in the ear
and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist
whilst he that hears makes fearful action
with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news
who with his shears and measure in his hand
standing on slippers which his nimble haste
had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
told of a many thousand warlike French
that were embattailed and rank'd in Kent
another lean unwash'd artificer
cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death
why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears
why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death
thy hand hath murder'd him I had a mighty cause
to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him

no had my lord why did you not provoke me

it is the curse of kings to be attended
by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
to break within the bloody house of life
and on the winking of authority
to understand a law to know the meaning
of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
more upon humour than advis'd respect

here is your hand and seal for what I did

O when the last account twixt heaven and earth
is to be made then shall this hand and seal
how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
makes ill deeds done Hadst not thou been by
a fellow by the hand of nature mark'd
quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame
this murder had not come into my mind
but taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect
finding thee fit for bloody villany
apt liable to be employ'd in danger
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death
and thou to be endeared to a king
made it no conscience to destroy a prince

my lord

hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
when I spake darkly what I purposed
or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face
as bid me tell my tale in express words
deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
but thou didst understand me by my signs
and didst in signs again parley with sin
yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
and consequently thy rude hand to act
the deed which both our tongues held vile to name
out of my sight and never see me more
my nobles leave me and my state is brav'd
even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers
nay in the body of this fleshly land
this kingdom this confine of blood and breath
hostility and civil tumult reigns
between my conscience and my cousin's death

arm you against your other enemies
I'll make a peace between your soul and you
young Arthur is alive this hand of mine
is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
not painted with the crimson spots of blood
within this bosom never enter'd yet
and you have slander'd nature in my form
which howsoever rude exteriorly
is yet the cover of a fairer mind
than to be butcher of an innocent child

doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers
throw this report on their incensed rage
and make them tame to their obedience
forgive the comment that my passion made
upon thy feature for my rage was blind
and foul imaginary eyes of blood
presented thee more hideous than thou art
O answer not but to my closet bring
the angry lords with all expedient haste
I conjure thee but slowly run more fast


the wall is high and yet will I leap down
good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
this ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite
I am afraid and yet I'll venture it
if I get down and do not break my limbs
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away
as good to die and go as die and stay

O me my uncle's spirit is in these stones
heaven take my soul and England keep my bones

lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury
it is our safety and we must embrace
this gentle offer of the perilous time

who brought that letter from the cardinal

the Count Melun a noble lord of France
whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
is much more general than these lines import


or rather then set forward for twill be
two long days' journey lords or e'er we meet


once more to-day well met distemper'd lords
the king by me requests your presence straight

the king hath dispossess'd himself of us
we will not line his thin bestained cloak
with our pure honours nor attend the foot
that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks
return and tell him so we know the worst

whate'er you think good words I think were best

our griefs and not our manners reason now

but there is little reason in your grief

sir sir impatience hath his privilege

'Tis true to hurt his master no man else

this is the prison

what is he lies here

O death made proud with pure and princely beauty
the earth had not a hole to hide this deed

murder as hating what himself hath done
doth lay it open to urge on revenge

or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave
found it too precious-princely for a grave

sir Richard what think you Have you beheld
or do you almost think although you see
that you do see could thought without this object
form such another This is the very top
the height the crest or crest unto the crest
of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame
the wildest savagery the vilest stroke
that ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
presented to the tears of soft remorse

all murders past do stand excus'd in this
and this so sole and so unmatchable
shall give a holiness a purity
to the yet unbegotten sin of times
and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
exampled by this heinous spectacle

it is a damned and a bloody work
the graceless action of a heavy hand
if that it be the work of any hand
if that it be the work of any hand
we had a kind of light what would ensue
it is the shameful work of Hubert's hand
the practice and the purpose of the king
from whose obedience I forbid my soul
kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
and breathing to his breathless excellence
the incense of a vow a holy vow
never to taste the pleasures of the world
never to be infected with delight
nor conversant with ease and idleness
till I have set a glory to this hand
by giving it the worship of revenge

our souls religiously confirm thy words

our souls religiously confirm thy words


Arthur doth live the king hath sent for you

O he is bold and blushes not at death
avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone

I am no villain

must I rob the law

your sword is bright sir put it up again

not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin

stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say
by heaven I think my sword's as sharp as yours
I would not have you lord forget yourself
nor tempt the danger of my true defence
lest I by marking of your rage forget
your worth your greatness and nobility
out dunghill dar'st thou brave a nobleman

not for my life but yet I dare defend
my innocent life against an emperor

thou art a murderer

do not prove me so
yet I am none Whose tongue soe'er speaks false
not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies

cut him to pieces

keep the peace I say

stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge

thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury
if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
I'll strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime
or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron
that you shall think the devil is come from hell

what wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge
second a villain and a murderer

lord Bigot I am none

who kill'd this prince

'Tis not an hour since I left him well
I honour'd him I lov'd him and will weep
my date of life out for his sweet life's loss

trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
for villany is not without such rheum
and he long traded in it makes it seem
like rivers of remorse and innocency
the uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house
for I am stifled with this smell of sin

away toward Bury to the Dauphin there

there tell the king he may inquire us out


here's a good world Knew you of this fair work
beyond the infinite and boundless reach
of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
art thou damn'd Hubert

do but hear me sir

ha I'll tell thee what
thou art damn'd as black nay nothing is so black
thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer
there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell

upon my soul

if thou didst but consent
to this most cruel act do but despair
and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread
that ever spider twisted from her womb
will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
put but a little water in a spoon
and it shall be as all the ocean
enough to stifle such a villain up
I do suspect thee very grievously

if I in act consent or sin of thought
be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
which was embounded in this beauteous clay
let hell want pains enough to torture me
I left him well
go bear him in thine arms
I am amaz'd methinks and lose my way
among the thorns and dangers of this world
how easy dost thou take all England up
from forth this morsel of dead royalty
the life the right and truth of all this realm
is fled to heaven and England now is left
to tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
the unow'd interest of proud swelling state
now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
now powers from home and discontents at home
meet in one line and vast confusion waits
as doth a raven on a sick-fallen beast
the imminent decay of wrested pomp
now happy he whose cloak and ceinture can
hold out this tempest Bear away that child
and follow me with speed I'll to the king
and heaven itself doth frown upon the land

thus have I yielded up into your hand
the circle of my glory

take again
from this my hand as holding of the pope
your sovereign greatness and authority

now keep your holy word go meet the French
and from his holiness use all your power
to stop their marches fore we are inflam'd
our discontented counties do revolt
our people quarrel with obedience
swearing allegiance and the love of soul
to stranger blood to foreign royalty
this inundation of mistemper'd humour
rests by you only to be qualified
then pause not for the present time's so sick
or overthrow incurable ensues

it was my breath that blew this tempest up
upon your stubborn usage of the pope
but since you are a gentle convertite
my tongue shall hush again this storm of war
and make fair weather in your blustering land
on this Ascension-day remember well
upon your oath of service to the pope
go I to make the French lay down their arms


is this Ascension-day Did not the prophet
say that before Ascension-day at noon
my crown I should give off Even so I have
I did suppose it should be on constraint
but heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary


but Dover Castle London hath receiv'd
like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers
your nobles will not hear you but are gone
to offer service to your enemy
and wild amazement hurries up and down
the little number of your doubtful friends

would not my lords return to me again
after they heard young Arthur was alive

they found him dead and cast into the streets
an empty casket where the jewel of life
by some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away

that villain Hubert told me he did live

so on my soul he did for aught he knew
but wherefore do you droop why look you sad
be great in act as you have been in thought
govern the motion of a kingly eye
be stirring as the time be fire with fire
threaten the threatener and outface the brow
of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
that borrow their behaviours from the great
grow great by your example and put on
the dauntless spirit of resolution
away and glister like the god of war
when he intendeth to become the field
show boldness and aspiring confidence
what shall they seek the lion in his den
and fright him there and make him tremble there
O let it not be said Forage and run
to meet displeasure further from the doors
and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh

the legate of the pope hath been with me
and I have made a happy peace with him
and he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers

O inglorious league
shall we upon the footing of our land
send fair-play orders and make compromise
insinuation parley and base truce
to arms invasive shall a beardless boy
a cocker'd silken wanton brave our fields
and flesh his spirit in a war-like soul
mocking the air with colours idly spread
and find no check Let us my liege to arms
perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
or if he do let it at least be said
they saw we had a purpose of defence

have thou the ordering of this present time

away then with good courage yet I know
our party may well meet a prouder foe

my Lord Melun let this be copied out
and keep it safe for our remembrance
return the precedent to these lords again
that having our fair order written down
both they and we perusing o'er these notes
may know wherefore we took the sacrament
and keep our faiths firm and inviolable

upon our sides it never shall be broken
and noble Dauphin albeit we swear
a voluntary zeal an unurg'd faith
to your proceedings yet believe me prince
I am not glad that such a sore of time
should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt
and heal the inveterate canker of one wound
by making many O it grieves my soul
that I must draw this metal from my side
to be a widow-maker O and there
where honourable rescue and defence
but such is the infection of the time
that for the health and physic of our right
we cannot deal but with the very hand
of stern injustice and confused wrong
and is't not pity O my grieved friends
that we the sons and children of this isle
were born to see so sad an hour as this
wherein we step after a stranger march
upon her gentle bosom and fill up
her enemies' ranks I must withdraw and weep
upon the spot of this enforced cause
to grace the gentry of a land remote
and follow unacquainted colours here
what here O nation that thou couldst remove
that Neptune's arms who clippeth thee about
would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
and gripple thee unto a pagan shore
where these two Christian armies might combine
the blood of malice in a vein of league

a noble temper dost thou show in this
and great affections wrestling in thy bosom
do make an earthquake of nobility
O what a noble combat hast thou fought
between compulsion and a brave respect
let me wipe off this honourable dew
that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
my heart hath melted at a lady's tears
being an ordinary inundation
but this effusion of such manly drops
this shower blown up by tempest of the soul
startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd
than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors
lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury
and with a great heart heave away this storm
commend these waters to those baby eyes
that never saw the giant world enrag'd
full warm of blood of mirth of gossiping
come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
into the purse of rich prosperity
as Lewis himself so nobles shall you all
that knit your sinews to the strength of mine


and even there methinks an angel spake
look where the holy legate comes apace
to give us warrant from the hand of heaven
and on our actions set the name of right

with holy breath

hail noble prince of France
the next is this King John hath reconcil'd
himself to Rome his spirit is come in
that so stood out against the holy church
the great metropolis and see of Rome
and tame the savage spirit of wild war
that like a lion foster'd up at hand
it may lie gently at the foot of peace
and be no further harmful than in show

your grace shall pardon me I will not back
I am too high-born to be propertied
to be a secondary at control
or useful serving-man and instrument
to any sovereign state throughout the world
your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
between this chastis'd kingdom and myself
and brought in matter that should feed this fire
and now tis far too huge to be blown out
with that same weak wind which enkindled it
you taught me how to know the face of right
acquainted me with interest to this land
yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
and come you now to tell me John hath made
I by the honour of my marriage-bed
after young Arthur claim this land for mine
and now it is half-conquer'd must I back
because that John hath made his peace with Rome
am I Rome's slave What penny hath Rome borne
what men provided what munition sent
to underprop this action is't not I
that undergo this charge who else but I
and such as to my claim are liable
sweat in this business and maintain this war
have I not heard these islanders shout out
vive le roy as I have bank'd their towns
have I not here the best cards for the game
to win this easy match play'd for a crown
and shall I now give o'er the yielded set
no no on my soul it never shall be said

you look but on the outside of this work

till my attempt so much be glorified
as to my ample hope was promised
before I drew this gallant head of war
and cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
to outlook conquest and to win renown
even in the jaws of danger and of death

what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us


according to the fair play of the world
let me have audience I am sent to speak
my holy Lord of Milan from the king
I come to learn how you have dealt for him
and as you answer I do know the scope
and warrant limited unto my tongue

the Dauphin is too wilful-opposite
and will not temporize with my entreaties

by all the blood that ever fury breath'd
the youth says well Now hear our English king
for thus his royalty doth speak in me
he is prepar'd and reason too he should
this apish and unmannerly approach
this harness'd masque and unadvised revel
this unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops
the king doth smile at and is well prepar'd
to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
from out the circle of his territories
that hand which had the strength even at your door
to cudgel you and make you take the hatch
to dive like buckets in concealed wells
to crouch in litter of your stable planks
to lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks
to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
even at the crying of your nation's crow
shall that victorious hand be feebled here
that in your chambers gave you chastisement
no Know the gallant monarch is in arms
and like an eagle o'er his aiery towers
to souse annoyance that comes near his nest
and you degenerate you ingrate revolts
you bloody Neroes ripping up the womb
of your dear mother England blush for shame
for your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids
like Amazons come tripping after drums
their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
their neelds to lances and their gentle hearts
to fierce and bloody inclination

there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well
we hold our time too precious to be spent
with such a brabbler


no I will speak

we will attend to neither
strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
plead for our interest and our being here

indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
and so shall you being beaten Do but start
an echo with the clamour of thy drum
and even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
that shall reverberate all as loud as thine
sound but another and another shall
as loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
and mock the deep-mouth'd thunder for at hand
not trusting to this halting legate here
whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need
is warlike John and in his forehead sits
a bare-ribb'd death whose office is this day

strike up our drums to find this danger out

and thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubt


how goes the day with us O tell me Hubert

badly I fear How fares your majesty

this fever that hath troubled me so long
lies heavy on me O my heart is sick


my lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge
desires your majesty to leave the field
and send him word by me which way you go

tell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there
be of good comfort for the great supply
that was expected by the Dauphin here
are wrack'd three nights ago on Goodwin sands
this news was brought to Richard but even now
the French fight coldly and retire themselves

ay me this tyrant fever burns me up
and will not let me welcome this good news
set on toward Swinstead to my litter straight
weakness possesseth me and I am faint


I did not think the king so stor'd with friends

up once again put spirit in the French
if they miscarry we miscarry too

that misbegotten devil Faulconbridge
in spite of spite alone upholds the day
they say King John sore sick hath left the field


lead me to the revolts of England here

when we were happy we had other names

it is the Count Melun

wounded to death

fly noble English you are bought and sold
unthread the rude eye of rebellion
and welcome home again discarded faith
seek out King John and fall before his feet
for if the French be lords of this loud day
he means to recompense the pains you take
by cutting off your heads Thus hath he sworn
and I with him and many moe with me
even on that altar where we swore to you
dear amity and everlasting love

may this be possible may this be true

have I not hideous death within my view
retaining but a quantity of life
which bleeds away even as a form of wax
resolveth from his figure gainst the fire
what in the world should make me now deceive
since I must lose the use of all deceit
why should I then be false since it is true
that I must die here and live hence by truth
I say again if Lewis do win the day
he is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
behold another day break in the east
but even this night whose black contagious breath
already smokes about the burning crest
of the old feeble and day-wearied sun
paying the fine of rated treachery
even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
if Lewis by your assistance win the day
commend me to one Hubert with your king
the love of him and this respect besides
for that my grandsire was an Englishman
awakes my conscience to confess all this
in lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence
from forth the noise and rumour of the field
where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
in peace and part this body and my soul
with contemplation and devout desires

we do believe thee and beshrew my soul
but I do love the favour and the form
of this most fair occasion by the which
we will untread the steps of damned flight
and like a bated and retired flood
leaving our rankness and irregular course
and calmly run on in obedience
even to our ocean to our great King John
my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
for I do see the cruel pangs of death
right in thine eye Away my friends New flight
and happy newness that intends old right


the sun of heaven methought was loath to set
but stay'd and made the western welkin blush
when the English measur'd backward their own ground
in faint retire O bravely came we off
when with a volley of our needless shot
after such bloody toil we bid good night
and wound our tottering colours clearly up
last in the field and almost lords of it


where is my prince the Dauphin
here what news

the Count Melun is slain the English lords
by his persuasion are again fall'n off
and your supply which you have wish'd so long
are cast away and sunk on Goodwin sands

Ah foul shrewd news Beshrew thy very heart
I did not think to be so sad to-night
as this hath made me Who was he that said
king John did fly an hour or two before
the stumbling night did part our weary powers

whoever spoke it it is true my lord

well keep good quarter and good care to-night
the day shall not be up so soon as I
to try the fair adventure of to-morrow

who's there speak ho speak quickly or I shoot

a friend What art thou

of the part of England

whither dost thou go

what's that to thee Why may not I demand
of thine affairs as well as thou of mine

Hubert I think

thou hast a perfect thought
I will upon all hazards well believe
thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well
who art thou

who thou wilt and if thou please
I come one way of the Plantagenets

unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night
have done me shame brave soldier pardon me
that any accent breaking from thy tongue
should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear

come come sans compliment what news abroad

why here walk I in the black brow of night
to find you out

brief then and what's the news

O my sweet sir news fitting to the night
black fearful comfortless and horrible

show me the very wound of this ill news
I am no woman I'll not swound at it
the king I fear is poison'd by a monk
I left him almost speechless and broke out
to acquaint you with this evil that you might
the better arm you to the sudden time
than if you had at leisure known of this

how did he take it who did taste to him

a monk I tell you a resolved villain
whose bowels suddenly burst out the king
yet speaks and peradventure may recover

whom didst thou leave to tend his majesty

why know you not the lords are all come back
and brought Prince Henry in their company
at whose request the king hath pardon'd them
and they are all about his majesty

and tempt us not to bear above our power
I'll tell thee Hubert half my power this night
passing these flats are taken by the tide
these Lincoln Washes have devoured them
myself well-mounted hardly have escap'd
away before conduct me to the king
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come


it is too late the life of all his blood
is touch'd corruptibly and his pure brain
which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house
doth by the idle comments that it makes
foretell the ending of mortality


his highness yet doth speak and holds belief
that being brought into the open air
it would allay the burning quality

let him be brought into the orchard here
doth he still rage


he is more patient
than when you left him even now he sung

O vanity of sickness fierce extremes
in their continuance will not feel themselves
death having prey'd upon the outward parts
leaves them invisible and his siege is now
against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
with many legions of strange fantasies
which in their throng and press to that last hold
confound themselves Tis strange that death should sing
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
and from the organ-pipe of frailty sings

be of good comfort prince for you are born
to set a form upon that indigest
which he hath left so shapeless and so rude


ay marry now my soul hath elbow-room
it would not out at windows nor at doors
there is so hot a summer in my bosom
that all my bowels crumble up to dust
I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
upon a parchment and against this fire
do I shrink up

how fares your majesty

poison'd ill-fare dead forsook cast off
and none of you will bid the winter come
to thrust his icy fingers in my maw
through my burn'd bosom nor entreat the north
to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
and comfort me with cold I do not ask you much
I beg cold comfort and you are so strait
and so ingrateful you deny me that

O that there were some virtue in my tears
that might relieve you

the salt in them is hot
within me is a hell and there the poison
is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize
on unreprievable condemned blood


O I am scalded with my violent motion
and spleen of speed to see your majesty

O cousin thou art come to set mine eye
and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
are turned to one thread one little hair
my heart hath one poor string to stay it by
which holds but till thy news be uttered
and then all this thou seest is but a clod
and module of confounded royalty

the Dauphin is preparing hitherward
where heaven he knows how we shall answer him
for in a night the best part of my power
as I upon advantage did remove
were in the Washes all unwarily
devoured by the unexpected flood


you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
my liege my lord But now a king now thus

even so must I run on and even so stop
when this was now a king and now is clay

art thou gone so I do but stay behind
to do the office for thee of revenge
and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
as it on earth hath been thy servant still
now now you stars that move in your right spheres
where be your powers Show now your mended faiths
and instantly return with me again
to push destruction and perpetual shame
out of the weak door of our fainting land
straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
the Dauphin rages at our very heels

it seems you know not then so much as we
the Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest
who half an hour since came from the Dauphin
and brings from him such offers of our peace
as we with honour and respect may take

he will the rather do it when he sees
ourselves well sinewed to our defence

nay it is in a manner done already
for many carriages he hath dispatch'd
to the sea-side and put his cause and quarrel
to the disposing of the cardinal
with whom yourself myself and other lords
if you think meet this afternoon will post
to consummate this business happily

let it be so And you my noble prince
with other princes that may best be spar'd
shall wait upon your father's funeral

at Worcester must his body be interr'd
for so he will'd it

and happily may your sweet self put on
the lineal state and glory of the land
to whom with all submission on my knee
I do bequeath my faithful services
and true subjection everlastingly

and the like tender of our love we make
to rest without a spot for evermore

I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
and knows not how to do it but with tears

O let us pay the time but needful woe
since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
this England never did nor never shall
lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
but when it first did help to wound itself
now these her princes are come home again
come the three corners of the world in arms
if England to itself do rest but true

THE LIFE OF KING HENRY V

chorus

O for a Muse of fire that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention
a kingdom for a stage princes to act
and monarchs to behold the swelling scene
then should the war-like Harry like himself
assume the port of Mars and at his heels
leash'd in like hounds should famine sword and fire
crouch for employment But pardon gentles all
the flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd
on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
so great an object can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France or may we cram
within this wooden O the very casques
O pardon since a crooked figure may
attest in little place a million
and let us ciphers to this great accompt
on your imaginary forces work
suppose within the girdle of these walls
are now confin'd two mighty monarchies
whose high upreared and abutting fronts
the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder
piece out our imperfections with your thoughts
into a thousand parts divide one man
and make imaginary puissance
think when we talk of horses that you see them
printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth
for tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings
carry them here and there jumping o'er times
turning the accomplishment of many years
into an hour-glass for the which supply
admit me Chorus to this history
who prologue-like your humble patience pray


my lord I'll tell you that self bill is urg'd
which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign
was like and had indeed against us pass'd
but that the scambling and unquiet time
did push it out of further question

but how my lord shall we resist it now

it must be thought on If it pass against us
we lose the better half of our possession
for all the temporal lands which men devout
by testament have given to the church
would they strip from us being valu'd thus
as much as would maintain to the king's honour
full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
six thousand and two hundred good esquires
and to relief of lazars and weak age
a hundred almshouses right well supplied
and to the coffers of the king beside
a thousand pounds by the year Thus runs the bill

this would drink deep

'Twould drink the cup and all

but what prevention

the king is full of grace and fair regard

and a true lover of the holy church

the courses of his youth promis'd it not
the breath no sooner left his father's body
but that his wildness mortified in him
seem'd to die too yea at that very moment
consideration like an angel came
leaving his body as a paradise
to envelop and contain celestial spirits
never was such a sudden scholar made
never came reformation in a flood
with such a heady currance scouring faults
nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
so soon did lose his seat and all at once
as in this king

we are blessed in the change

hear him but reason in divinity
and all-admiring with an inward wish
you would desire the king were made a prelate
hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
you would say it hath been all in all his study
list his discourse of war and you shall hear
a fearful battle render'd you in music
turn him to any cause of policy
familiar as his garter that when he speaks
the air a charter'd libertine is still
and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
to steal his sweet and honey'd sentences
so that the art and practic part of life
must be the mistress to this theoric
which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it
since his addiction was to courses vain
his companies unletter'd rude and shallow
his hours fill'd up with riots banquets sports
and never noted in him any study
any retirement any sequestration
from open haunts and popularity

the strawberry grows underneath the nettle
and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality
and so the prince obscur'd his contemplation
under the veil of wildness which no doubt
unseen yet crescive in his faculty

it must be so for miracles are ceas'd
and therefore we must needs admit the means
how things are perfected

but my good lord
how now for mitigation of this bill
urg'd by the commons Doth his majesty
incline to it or no

he seems indifferent
or rather swaying more upon our part
than cherishing the exhibiters against us
for I have made an offer to his majesty
upon our spiritual convocation
and in regard of causes now in hand
which I have open'd to his Grace at large
as touching France to give a greater sum
did to his predecessors part withal

how did this offer seem receiv'd my lord

with good acceptance of his majesty
save that there was not time enough to hear
as I perceiv'd his Grace would fain have done
the severals and unhidden passages
of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
and generally to the crown and seat of France
deriv'd from Edward his great-grandfather

what was the impediment that broke this off

the French ambassador upon that instant
crav'd audience and the hour I think is come
to give him hearing is it four o'clock

it is
then go we in to know his embassy
which I could with a ready guess declare
before the Frenchman speak a word of it

I'll wait upon you and I long to hear it


where is my gracious lord of Canterbury

not here in presence

send for him good uncle

shall we call in the ambassador my liege

not yet my cousin we would be resolv'd
before we hear him of some things of weight
that task our thoughts concerning us and France

God and his angels guard your sacred throne
and make you long become it

sure we thank you
my learned lord we pray you to proceed
and justly and religiously unfold
why the law Salique that they have in France
or should or should not bar us in our claim
and God forbid my dear and faithful lord
that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
or nicely charge your understanding soul
with opening titles miscreate whose right
suits not in native colours with the truth
for God doth know how many now in health
shall drop their blood in approbation
of what your reverence shall incite us to
therefore take heed how you impawn our person
how you awake the sleeping sword of war
we charge you in the name of God take heed
without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
are every one a woe a sore complaint
'Gainst him whose wrongs give edge unto the swords
that make such waste in brief mortality
under this conjuration speak my lord
and we will hear note and believe in heart
that what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
as pure as sin with baptism

then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
that owe yourselves your lives and services
to this imperial throne There is no bar
to make against your highness' claim to France
but this which they produce from Pharamond
in terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land
which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
to be the realm of France and Pharamond
the founder of this law and female bar
that the land Salique is in Germany
between the floods of Sala and of Elbe
where Charles the Great having subdu'd the Saxons
there left behind and settled certain French
who holding in disdain the German women
for some dishonest manners of their life
establish'd then this law to wit no female
should be inheritrix in Salique land
which Salique as I said twixt Elbe and Sala
is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen
then doth it well appear the Salique law
was not devised for the realm of France
nor did the French possess the Salique land
until four hundred one-and-twenty years
after defunction of King Pharamond
idly suppos'd the founder of this law
who died within the year of our redemption
four hundred twenty-six and Charles the Great
subdu'd the Saxons and did seat the French
eight hundred five Besides their writers say
king Pepin which deposed Childeric
did as heir general being descended
of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair
make claim and title to the crown of France
Hugh Capet also who usurp'd the crown
of Charles the Duke of Loraine sole heir male
of the true line and stock of Charles the Great
to find his title with some shows of truth
though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare
daughter to Charlemain who was the son
to Lewis the emperor and Lewis the son
of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth
who was sole heir to the usurper Capet
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of France till satisfied
that fair Queen Isabel his grandmother
was lineal of the Lady Ermengare
by the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
was re-united to the crown of France
so that as clear as is the summer's sun
king Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim
king Lewis his satisfaction all appear
to hold in right and title of the female
so do the kings of France unto this day
howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
to bar your highness claiming from the female
and rather choose to hide them in a net
than amply to imbar their crooked titles
usurp'd from you and your progenitors

may I with right and conscience make this claim

the sin upon my head dread sovereign
for in the book of Numbers is it writ
'When the son dies let the inheritance
descend unto the daughter Gracious lord
look back into your mighty ancestors
go my dread lord to your great-grandsire's tomb
from whom you claim invoke his war-like spirit
and your great-uncle's Edward the Black Prince
who on the French ground play'd a tragedy
making defeat on the full power of France
whiles his most mighty father on a hill
stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
forage in blood of French nobility
O noble English that could entertain
with half their forces the full pride of France
and let another half stand laughing by
all out of work and cold for action

awake remembrance of these valiant dead
and with your puissant arm renew their feats
you are their heir you sit upon their throne
the blood and courage that renowned them
runs in your veins and my thrice-puissantliege
ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises

your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
do all expect that you should rouse yourself
as did the former lions of your blood

they know your Grace hath cause and means and might
so hath your highness never King of England
had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
and lie pavilion'd in the fields of France

O let their bodies follow my dear liege
with blood and sword and fire to win your right
in aid whereof we of the spiritualty
will raise your highness such a mighty sum
as never did the clergy at one time
bring in to any of your ancestors

but lay down our proportions to defend
against the Scot who will make road upon us
with all advantages

they of those marches gracious sovereign
shall be a wall sufficient to defend
our inland from the pilfering borderers

we do not mean the coursing snatchers only
but fear the main intendment of the Scot
who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
for you shall read that my great-grandfather
never went with his forces into France
but that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
came pouring like the tide into a breach
with ample and brim fulness of his force
galling the gleaned land with hot essays
girding with grievous siege castles and towns
that England being empty of defence

she hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege
for hear her but exampled by herself
when all her chivalry hath been in France
and she a mourning widow of her nobles
she hath herself not only well defended
but taken and impounded as a stray
the King of Scots whom she did send to France
to fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
and make your chronicle as rich with praise
as is the owse and bottom of the sea
with sunken wrack and sumless treasuries

but there's a saying very old and true

if that you will France win
then with Scotland first begin

for once the eagle England being in prey
comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
playing the mouse in absence of the cat
to tear and havoc more than she can eat

it follows then the cat must stay at home
yet that is but a crush'd necessity
since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
while that the armed hand doth fight abroad
the advised head defends itself at home
for government though high and low and lower
put into parts doth keep in one consent
congreeing in a full and natural close
like music

therefore doth heaven divide
the state of man in divers functions
setting endeavour in continual motion
to which is fixed as an aim or butt
creatures that by a rule in nature teach
the act of order to a peopled kingdom
they have a king and officers of sorts
where some like magistrates correct at home
others like merchants venture trade abroad
others like soldiers armed in their stings
make boot upon the summer's velvet buds
which pillage they with merry march bring home
to the tent-royal of their emperor
who busied in his majesty surveys
the singing masons building roofs of gold
the civil citizens kneading up the honey
the poor mechanic porters crowding in
their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
the sad-ey'd justice with his surly hum
delivering o'er to executors pale
the lazy yawning drone I this infer
that many things having full reference
to one consent may work contrariously
fly to one mark as many ways meet in one town
as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
as many lines close in the dial's centre
so may a thousand actions once afoot
end in one purpose and be all well borne
without defeat Therefore to France my liege
divide your happy England into four
whereof take you one quarter into France
and you withal shall make all Gallia shake
if we with thrice such powers left at home
cannot defend our own doors from the dog
let us be worried and our nation lose
the name of hardiness and policy

call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin

now are we well resolv'd and by God's help
and yours the noble sinews of our power
France being ours we'll bend it to our awe
ruling in large and ample empery
o'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms
or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
tombless with no remembrance over them
either our history shall with full mouth
speak freely of our acts or else our grave
like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph


now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear

your greeting is from him not from the king

may't please your majesty to give us leave
freely to render what we have in charge
or shall we sparingly show you far off
the Dauphin's meaning and our embassy
we are no tyrant but a Christian king
unto whose grace our passion is as subject
as are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons
therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
tell us the Dauphin's mind

thus then in few
your highness lately sending into France
did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
of your great predecessor King Edward the Third
in answer of which claim the prince our master
says that you savour too much of your youth
and bids you be advis'd there's nought in France
that can be with a nimble galliard won
you cannot revel into dukedoms there
he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
this tun of treasure and in lieu of this
desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks
what treasure uncle

tennis-balls my liege

we are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us
his present and your pains we thank you for
when we have match'd our rackets to these balls
we will in France by God's grace play a set
shall strike his father's crown into the hazard
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
that all the courts of France will be disturb'd
with chaces And we understand him well
how he comes o'er us with our wilder days
not measuring what use we made of them
we never valu'd this poor seat of England
and therefore living hence did give ourself
to barbarous licence as tis ever common
that men are merriest when they are from home
but tell the Dauphin I will keep my state
when I do rouse me in my throne of France
for that I have laid by my majesty
and plodded like a man for working-days
but I will rise there with so full a glory
that I will dazzle all the eyes of France
yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us
and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones and his soul
shall stand sore-charged for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
and some are yet ungotten and unborn
that shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn
but this lies all within the will of God
to whom I do appeal and in whose name
tell you the Dauphin I am coming on
to venge me as I may and to put forth
my rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause
his jest will savour but of shallow wit
when thousands weep more than did laugh at it
convey them with safe conduct Fare you well


this was a merry message

we hope to make the sender blush at it
therefore my lords omit no happy hour
that may give furtherance to our expedition
for we have now no thought in us but France
save those to God that run before our business
therefore let our proportions for these wars
be soon collected and all things thought upon
that may with reasonable swiftness add
more feathers to our wings for God before
we'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door
therefore let every man now task his thought
that this fair action may on foot be brought
now all the youth of England are on fire
and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
now thrive the armourers and honour's thought
reigns solely in the breast of every man
they sell the pasture now to buy the horse
following the mirror of all Christian kings
with winged heels as English Mercuries
for now sits Expectation in the air
and hides a sword from hilts unto the point
with crowns imperial crowns and coronets
promis'd to Harry and his followers
the French advis'd by good intelligence
of this most dreadful preparation
shake in their fear and with pale policy
seek to divert the English purposes
O England model to thy inward greatness
like little body with a mighty heart
what mightst thou do that honour would thee do
were all thy children kind and natural
a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
one Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third
sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland
have for the gilt of France O guilt indeed
confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France
and by their hands this grace of kings must die
if hell and treason hold their promises
ere he take ship for France and in Southampton
linger your patience on and well digest
the abuse of distance while we force a play
the sum is paid the traitors are agreed
the king is set from London and the scene
is now transported gentles to Southampton
there is the playhouse now there must you sit
and thence to France shall we convey you safe
and bring you back charming the narrow seas
to give you gentle pass for if we may
but till the king come forth and not till then
unto Southampton do we shift our scene

well met Corporal Nym

good morrow Lieutenant Bardolph

what are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet

for my part I care not I say little but when time shall serve there shall be smiles but that shall be as it may I dare not fight but I will wink and hold out mine iron It is a simple one but what though it will toast cheese and it will endure cold as another man's sword will and there's an end

I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France let it be so good Corporal Nym

faith I will live so long as I may that's the certain of it and when I cannot live any longer I will do as I may that is my rest that is the rendezvous of it

it is certain corporal that he is married to Nell Quickly and certainly she did you wrong for you were troth-plight to her

I cannot tell things must be as they may men may sleep and they may have their throats about them at that time and some say knives have edges It must be as it may though patience be a tired mare yet she will plod There must be conclusions Well I cannot tell

here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife Good corporal be patient here How now mine host Pistol

base tike call'st thou me host
now by this hand I swear I scorn the term
nor shall my Nell keep lodgers

no by my troth not long for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house straight [

good lieutenant good corporal offer nothing here

Pish

Pish for thee Iceland dog thou prickeared cur of Iceland

good Corporal Nym show thy valour and put up your sword

will you shog off I would have you solus


the solus in thy most mervailous face
the solus in thy teeth and in thy throat
and in thy hateful lungs yea in thy maw perdy
and which is worse within thy nasty mouth
I do retort the solus in thy bowels
for I can take and Pistol's cock is up
and flashing fire will follow

I am not Barbason you cannot conjure me I have an humour to knock you indifferently well If you grow foul with me Pistol I will scour you with my rapier as I may in fair terms if you would walk off I would prick your guts a little in good terms as I may and that's the humour of it

O braggart vile and damned furious wight
the grave doth gape and doting death is near
therefore exhale

hear me hear me what I say he that strikes the first stroke I'll run him up to the hilts as I am a soldier


an oath of mickle might and fury shall abate
give me thy fist thy fore-foot to me give

I will cut thy throat one time or other in fair terms that is the humour of it

coupe le gorge
that is the word I thee defy again
O hound of Crete think'st thou my spouse to get
no to the spital go
and from the powdering-tub of infamy
fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind
Doll Tearsheet she by name and her espouse
I have and I will hold the quondam Quickly
for the only she and pauca there's enough
go to


mine host Pistol you must come to my master and your hostess he is very sick and would to bed Good Bardolph put thy face between his sheets and do the office of a warming-pan Faith he's very ill

away you rogue



come shall I make you two friends We must to France together Why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another's throats

let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on

you'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting

base is the slave that pays

that now I will have that's the humour of it

as manhood shall compound push home


by this sword he that makes the first thrust I'll kill him by this sword I will

sword is an oath and oaths must have their course


I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting

a noble shalt thou have and present pay
and liquor likewise will I give to thee
and friendship shall combine and brotherhood
I'll live by Nym and Nym shall live by me
is not this just for I shall sutler be
unto the camp and profits will accrue
give me thy hand

I shall have my noble

in cash most justly paid


well then that's the humour of it



the king hath run bad humours on the knight that's the even of it

Nym thou hast spoke the right
his heart is fracted and corroborate

the king is a good king but it must be as it may he passes some humours and careers

let us condole the knight for lambkins we will live


'Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors

they shall be apprehended by and by

how smooth and even they do bear themselves
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
crowned with faith and constant loyalty

by interception which they dream not of

nay but the man that was his bedfellow
whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours
that he should for a foreign purse so sell
his sovereign's life to death and treachery


now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
my Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham
and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
think you not that the powers we bear with us
will cut their passage through the force of France
doing the execution and the act
for which we have in head assembled them

no doubt my liege if each man do his best

I doubt not that since we are well persuaded
that grows not in a fair consent with ours
nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
success and conquest to attend on us

never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
than is your majesty there's not I think a subject
that sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
under the sweet shade of your government

true those that were your father's enemies
have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
with hearts create of duty and of zeal

we therefore have great cause of thankfulness
and shall forget the office of our hand
sooner than quittance of desert and merit
according to the weight and worthiness

so service shall with steeled sinews toil
to do your Grace incessant services

we judge no less Uncle of Exeter
enlarge the man committed yesterday
that rail'd against our person we consider
it was excess of wine that set him on
and on his more advice we pardon him

that's mercy but too much security
let him be punish'd sovereign lest example
breed by his sufference more of such a kind

O let us yet be merciful

so may your highness and yet punish too

sir
you show great mercy if you give him life
after the taste of much correction
alas your too much love and care of me
are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
if little faults proceeding on distemper
shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested
appear before us We'll yet enlarge that man
though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care
and tender preservation of our person
would have him punish'd And now to our French causes
who are the late commissioners

I one my lord
your highness bade me ask for it to-day

so did you me my liege

and I my royal sovereign

then Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours
grey of Northumberland this same is yours
read them and know I know your worthiness
my Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter
we will aboard to-night Why how now gentlemen
what see you in those papers that you lose
so much complexion Look ye how they change
their cheeks are paper Why what read you there
that hath so cowarded and chas'd your blood
out of appearance

I do confess my fault
and do submit me to your highness' mercy

to which we all appeal

to which we all appeal

the mercy that was quick in us but late
by your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd
for your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you
see you my princes and my noble peers
these English monsters My Lord of Cambridge here
you know how apt our love was to accord
to furnish him with all appertinents
belonging to his honour and this man
hath for a few light crowns lightly conspir'd
and sworn unto the practices of France
to kill us here in Hampton to the which
this knight no less for bounty bound to us
than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O
what shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel
ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
that knew'st the very bottom of my soul
that almost mightst have coin'd me into gold
wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use
may it be possible that foreign hire
that might annoy my finger tis so strange
that though the truth of it stands off as gross
as black from white my eye will scarcely see it
treason and murder ever kept together
as two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose
working so grossly in a natural cause
that admiration did not whoop at them
but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
wonder to wait on treason and on murder
and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
that wrought upon thee so preposterously
hath got the voice in hell for excellence
and other devils that suggest by treasons
do botch and bungle up damnation
with patches colours and with forms being fetch'd
from glistering semblances of piety
but he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up
gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
should with his lion gait walk the whole world
he might return to vasty Tartar back
and tell the legions I can never win
a soul so easy as that Englishman's
O how hast thou with jealousy infected
the sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful
why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
why so didst thou come they of noble family
why so didst thou seem they religious
why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement
not working with the eye without the ear
and but in purged judgment trusting neither
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
to mark the full-fraught man and best indu'd
with some suspicion I will weep for thee
another fall of man Their faults are open
arrest them to the answer of the law
and God acquit them of their practices

I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland

our purposes God justly hath discover'd
and I repent my fault more than my death
which I beseech your highness to forgive
although my body pay the price of it

for me the gold of France did not seduce
although I did admit it as a motive
the sooner to effect what I intended
but God be thanked for prevention
which I in sufference heartily will rejoice
beseeching God and you to pardon me
never did faithful subject more rejoice
at the discovery of most dangerous treason
than I do at this hour joy o'er myself
prevented from a damned enterprise
my fault but not my body pardon sovereign

God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence
you have conspir'd against our royal person
join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
receiv'd the golden earnest of our death
wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
his princes and his peers to servitude
his subjects to oppression and contempt
and his whole kingdom into desolation
touching our person seek we no revenge
but we our kingdom's safety must so tender
whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
we do deliver you Get you therefore hence
poor miserable wretches to your death
patience to endure and true repentance
of all your dear offences Bear them hence

now lords for France the enterprise whereof
shall be to you as us like glorious
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war
since God so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way
to hinder our beginnings We doubt not now
but every rub is smoothed on our way
then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
our puissance into the hand of God
putting it straight in expedition
cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
no king of England if not king of France


prithee honey-sweet husband let me bring thee to Staines

Bardolph be blithe Nym rouse thy vaunting veins
boy bristle thy courage up for Falstaff he is dead
and we must yearn therefore

would I were with him wheresome'er he is either in heaven or in hell

nay sure he's not in hell he's in Arthur's bosom if ever man went to Arthur's bosom A' made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child a' parted even just between twelve and one even at the turning o' the tide for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends I knew there was but one way for his nose was as sharp as a pen and a' babbled of green fields How now Sir John quoth I what man be of good cheer So a' cried out God God God three or four times now I to comfort him bid him a' should not think of God I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet So a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet I put my hand into the bed and felt them and they were as cold as any stone then I felt to his knees and so upward and upward and all was as cold as any stone

they say he cried out of sack

ay that a' did

and of women

nay that a' did not

yes that a' did and said they were devils incarnate

a' could never abide carnation twas a colour he never liked
a' said once the devil would have him about women

a' did in some sort indeed handle women but then he was rheumatic and talked of the whore of Babylon

do you not remember a' saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose and a' said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire

well the fuel is gone that maintained that fire that's all the riches I got in his service

shall we shog the king will be gone from Southampton

come let's away My love give me thy lips
look to my chattels and my moveables
let senses rule the word is Pitch and pay
trust none
for oaths are straws men's faiths are wafercakes
and hold-fast is the only dog my duck
therefore caveto be thy counsellor
go clear thy crystals Yoke-fellows in arms
let us to France like horse-leeches my boys

and that's but unwholesome food they say

touch her soft mouth and march

farewell hostess


I cannot kiss that is the humour of it but adieu

let housewifery appear keep close I thee command

farewell adieu

thus come the English with full power upon us
and more than carefully it us concerns
to answer royally in our defences
therefore the Dukes of Berri and Britaine
of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth
to line and new repair our towns of war
with men of courage and with means defendant
for England his approaches makes as fierce
as waters to the sucking of a gulf
it fits us then to be as provident
as fear may teach us out of late examples
left by the fatal and neglected English
upon our fields

my most redoubted father
it is most meet we arm us gainst the foe
for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
though war nor no known quarrel were in question
but that defences musters preparations
should be maintain'd assembled and collected
as were a war in expectation
therefore I say tis meet we all go forth
to view the sick and feeble parts of France
and let us do it with no show of fear
were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance
for my good liege she is so idly king'd
her sceptre so fantastically borne
by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
that fear attends her not

O peace Prince Dauphin
you are too much mistaken in this king
question your Grace the late ambassadors
with what great state he heard their embassy
how well supplied with noble counsellors
how modest in exception and withal
how terrible in constant resolution
and you shall find his vanities forespent
were but the outside of the Roman Brutus
covering discretion with a coat of folly
as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
that shall first spring and be most delicate

but though we think it so it is no matter
in cases of defence tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems
so the proportions of defence are fill'd
which of a weak and niggardly projection
doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
a little cloth

think we King Harry strong
and princes look you strongly arm to meet him
the kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us
and he is bred out of that bloody strain
that haunted us in our familiar paths
witness our too much memorable shame
when Cressy battle fatally was struck
and all our princes captiv'd by the hand
of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales
whiles that his mounting sire on mountain standing
up in the air crown'd with the golden sun
mangle the work of nature and deface
the patterns that by God and by French fathers
had twenty years been made This is a stem
of that victorious stock and let us fear
the native mightiness and fate of him


ambassadors from Harry King of England
do crave admittance to your majesty

we'll give them present audience Go and bring them

you see this chase is hotly follow'd friends

turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
runs far before them Good my sovereign
take up the English short and let them know
of what a monarchy you are the head
as self-neglecting


from our brother England

from him and thus he greets your majesty
he wills you in the name of God Almighty
that you divest yourself and lay apart
the borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven
by law of nature and of nations long
to him and to his heirs namely the crown
and all wide-stretched honours that pertain
by custom and the ordinance of times
unto the crown of France That you may know
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days
nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd
he sends you this most memorable line

willing you overlook this pedigree
and when you find him evenly deriv'd
from his most fam'd of famous ancestors
Edward the Third he bids you then resign
your crown and kingdom indirectly held
from him the native and true challenger

or else what follows

bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
even in your hearts there will he rake for it
therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
in thunder and in earthquake like a Jove
that if requiring fail he will compel
and bids you in the bowels of the Lord
deliver up the crown and to take mercy
on the poor souls for whom this hungry war
opens his vasty jaws and on your head
turning the widows' tears the orphans' cries
for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
that shall be swallow'd in this controversy
this is his claim his threat'ning and my message
unless the Dauphin be in presence here
to whom expressly I bring greeting too

for us we will consider of this further
to-morrow shall you bear our full intent
back to our brother England

for the Dauphin
I stand here for him what to him from England

scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
and anything that may not misbecome
the mighty sender doth he prize you at
thus says my king an if your father's highness
do not in grant of all demands at large
sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty
that caves and womby vaultages of France
shall chide your trespass and return your mock
in second accent of his ordinance

say if my father render fair return
it is against my will for I desire
nothing but odds with England to that end
as matching to his youth and vanity
I did present him with the Paris balls

he'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it
were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe
and be assur'd you'll find a difference
as we his subjects have in wonder found
between the promise of his greener days
and these he masters now Now he weighs time
even to the utmost grain that you shall read
in your own losses if he stay in France


dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
come here himself to question our delay
for he is footed in this land already

you shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions
a night is but small breath and little pause
to answer matters of this consequence

thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies
in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought Suppose that you have seen
the well-appointed king at Hampton pier
embark his royalty and his brave fleet
with silken streamers the young Ph bus fanning
play with your fancies and in them behold
upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing
hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
to sounds confus'd behold the threaden sails
draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea
breasting the lofty surge O do but think
you stand upon the rivage and behold
a city on the inconstant billows dancing
for so appears this fleet majestical
holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow
grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
and leave your England as dead midnight still
guarded with grandsires babies and old women
either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance
for who is he whose chin is but enrich'd
with one appearing hair that will not follow
those call'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France
work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
behold the ordenance on their carriages
with fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur
suppose the ambassador from the French comes back
tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Katharine his daughter and with her to dowry
the offer likes not and the nimble gunner
with linstock now the devilish cannon touches

and down goes all before them Still be kind
and eke out our performance with your mind

once more unto the breach dear friends once more
or close the wall up with our English dead
in peace there's nothing so becomes a man
as modest stillness and humility
but when the blast of war blows in our ears
then imitate the action of the tiger
stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage
then lend the eye a terrible aspect
let it pry through the portage of the head
like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it
as fearfully as doth a galled rock
o'erhang and jutty his confounded base
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
to his full height On on you noblest English
whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof
fathers that like so many Alexanders
have in these parts from morn till even fought
and sheath'd their swords for lack of argument
dishonour not your mothers now attest
that those whom you call'd fathers did beget you
be copy now to men of grosser blood
and teach them how to war And you good yeomen
whose limbs were made in England show us here
the mettle of your pasture let us swear
that you are worth your breeding which I doubt not
for there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
straining upon the start The game's afoot
follow your spirit and upon this charge


on on on on on to the breach to the breach

pray thee corporal stay the knocks are too hot and for mine own part I have not a case of lives the humour of it is too hot that is the very plain-song of it

the plain-song is most just for humours do abound

knocks go and come God's vassals drop and die
and sword and shield
in bloody field
doth win immortal fame


would I were in an alehouse in London I would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety

and I

if wishes would prevail with me
but thither would I hie

as duly
but not as truly
as bird doth sing on bough

up to the breach you dogs avaunt you cullions


be merciful great duke to men of mould
abate thy rage abate thy manly rage
abate thy rage great duke
good bawcock bate thy rage use lenity sweet chuck

these be good humours your honour wins bad humours


as young as I am I have observed these three swashers I am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antiques do not amount to a man For Bardolph he is white-livered and red-faced by the means whereof a' faces it out but fights not For Pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof a' breaks words and keeps whole weapons For Nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a' should be thought a coward but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds for a' never broke any man's head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk They will steal any thing and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lute-case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three half-pence Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals they would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and seek some better service their villany goes against my weak stomach and therefore I must cast it up


to the mines tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines For look you the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war the concavities of it is not sufficient for look you th' athversary you may discuss unto the duke look you is digt himself four yards under the countermines by Cheshu I think a' will plow up all if there is not better directions

the Duke of Gloucester to whom the order of the siege is given is altogether directed by an Irishman a very valiant gentleman i' faith

it is Captain Macmorris is it not

I think it be

by Cheshu he is an ass as in the world
I will verify as much in his peard he has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars look you of the Roman disciplines than is a puppy-dog


here a' comes and the Scots captain Captain Jamy with him

captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman that is certain and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars upon my particular knowledge of his directions by Cheshu he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans

I say gud day Captain Fluellen


how now Captain Macmorris have you quit the mines have the pioners given o'er

by Chrish la tish ill done the work ish give over the trumpet sound the retreat By my hand I swear and my father's soul the work ish ill done it ish give over I would have blowed up the town so Chrish save me la in an hour O tish ill done tish ill done by my hand tish ill done

captain Macmorris I beseech you now will you voutsafe me look you a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war the Roman wars in the way of argument look you and friendly communication partly to satisfy my opinion and partly for the satisfaction look you of my mind as touching the direction of the military discipline that is the point

it sall be vary gud gud feith gud captains bath

and I sall quit you with gud leve as I may pick occasion that sall I marry

it is no time to discourse so Chrish save me the day is hot and the weather and the wars and the king and the dukes it is no time to discourse The town is beseeched and the trumpet calls us to the breach and we talk and be Chrish do nothing tis shame for us all so God sa' me tis shame to stand still it is shame by my hand and there is throats to be cut and works to be done and there ish nothing done so Chrish sa' me la

by the mess ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slumber aile do gud service or aile lig i' the grund for it ay or go to death and aile pay it as valorously as I may that sal I suerly do that is the breff and the long Marry I wad full fain heard some question tween you tway

captain Macmorris I think look you under your correction there is not many of your nation

of my nation What ish my nation ish a villain and a bastard and a knave and a rascal What ish my nation Who talks of my nation


I do not know you so good a man as myself so Chrish save me I will cut off your head

gentlemen both you will mistake each other

a that's a foul fault


the town sounds a parley

captain Macmorris when there is more better opportunity to be required look you I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of wars and there is an end

how yet resolves the governor of the town
this is the latest parle we will admit
therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
or like to men proud of destruction
defy us to our worst for as I am a soldier
a name that in my thoughts becomes me best
if I begin the battery once again
till in her ashes she lie buried
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up
and the flesh'd soldier rough and hard of heart
in liberty of bloody hand shall range
with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants
what is it then to me if impious war
array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends
do with his smirch'd complexion all fell feats
enlink'd to waste and desolation
what is't to me when you yourselves are cause
if your pure maidens fall into the hand
of hot and forcing violation
what rein can hold licentious wickedness
when down the hill he holds his fierce career
we may as bootless spend our vain command
upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
as send precepts to the leviathan
to come ashore Therefore you men of Harfleur
whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
of heady murder spoil and villany
if not why in a moment look to see
the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters
your fathers taken by the silver beards
and their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls
your naked infants spitted upon pikes
whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd
do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry
at Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen
what say you will you yield and this avoid
or guilty in defence be thus destroy'd

our expectation hath this day an end
the Dauphin whom of succour we entreated
returns us that his powers are yet not ready
we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
enter our gates dispose of us and ours
for we no longer are defensible

open your gates Come uncle Exeter
go you and enter Harfleur there remain
and fortify it strongly gainst the French
use mercy to them all For us dear uncle
the winter coming on and sickness growing
upon our soldiers we will retire to Calais
to-night in Harfleur will we be your guest
to-morrow for the march are we addrest

'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme

and if he be not fought withal my lord
let us not live in France let us quit all
and give our vineyards to a barbarous people

O Dieu vivant shall a few sprays of us
the emptying of our fathers' luxury
our scions put in wild and savage stock
spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
and overlook their grafters

Normans but bastard Normans Norman bastards
unfought withal but I will sell my dukedom
to buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
in that nook-shotten isle of Albion

Dieu de battailes where have they this mettle
is not their climate foggy raw and dull
on whom as in despite the sun looks pale
killing their fruit with frowns Can sodden water
a drench for sur-rein'd jades their barley-broth
decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
and shall our quick blood spirited with wine
seem frosty O for honour of our land
let us not hang like roping icicles
upon our houses' thatch whiles a more frosty people
sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields
poor we may call them in their native lords

by faith and honour
our madams mock at us and plainly say
their bodies to the lust of English youth
to new-store France with bastard warriors

they bid us to the English dancing-schools
and teach lavoltas high and swift corantos
saying our grace is only in our heels
and that we are most lofty runaways

where is Montjoy the herald speed him hence
let him greet England with our sharp defiance
up princes and with spirit of honour edg'd
more sharper than your swords hie to the field
Charles Delabreth High Constable of France
you Dukes of Orleans Bourbon and Berri
Alen on Brabant Bar and Burgundy
Jaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont
beaumont Grandpr Roussi and Fauconberg
Foix Lestrale Bouciqualt and Charolois
high dukes great princes barons lords and knights
bar Harry England that sweeps through our land
with pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur
rush on his host as doth the melted snow
upon the valleys whose low vassal seat
the Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
go down upon him you have power enough
and in a captive chariot into Roan
bring him our prisoner

this becomes the great
sorry am I his numbers are so few
his soldiers sick and famish'd in their march
for I am sure when he shall see our army
he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
and for achievement offer us his ransom

therefore lord constable haste on Montjoy
and let him say to England that we send
to know what willing ransom he will give

not so I do beseech your majesty

be patient for you shall remain with us
now forth lord constable and princes all
and quickly bring us word of England's fall


how now Captain Fluellen come you from the bridge

I assure you there is very excellent services committed at the pridge

is the Duke of Exeter safe

the Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon and a man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power he is not God be praised and plessed any hurt in the world but keeps the pridge most valiantly with excellent discipline There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is a man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as gallant service

what do you call him

he is called Aunchient Pistol
I know him not


here is the man

captain I thee beseech to do me favours
the Duke of Exeter doth love thee well

ay I praise God and I have merited some love at his hands

Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
and giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel
that goddess blind
that stands upon the rolling restless stone

by your patience Aunchient Pistol Fortune is painted plind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that Fortune is plind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it Fortune is an excellent moral

fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him
a damned death
let gallows gape for dog let man go free
and let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate
but Exeter hath given the doom of death
for pax of little price
therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice
and let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
with edge of penny cord and vile reproach
speak captain for his life and I will thee requite

aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaning

why then rejoice therefore

certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline ought to be used

die and be damn'd and figo for thy friendship

it is well
the fig of Spain


very good

why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I remember him now a bawd a cutpurse

I'll assure you a' uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day But it is very well what he has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is serve

why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with new-tuned oaths and what a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on But you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistook

I tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if I find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind

hark you the king is coming and I must speak with him from the pridgo


God pless your majesty

how now Fluellen cam'st thou from the bridge
ay so please your majesty The Duke of Exeter hath very gallantly maintained the pridge the French is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages Marry th' athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge I can tell your majesty the duke is a prave man

what men have you lost Fluellen

the perdition of th' athversary hath been very great reasonable great marry for my part I think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one Bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o' fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fire's out

we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner


you know me by my habit

well then I know thee what shall I know of thee

my master's mind

unfold it

thus says my king Say thou to Harry of England Though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to re-answer his pettiness would bow under For our losses his exchequer is too poor for the effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction To this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounced So far my king and master so much my office


Montjoy

thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back
and tell thy king I do not seek him now
but could be willing to march on to Calais
without impeachment for to say the sooth
though tis no wisdom to confess so much
unto an enemy of craft and vantage
my people are with sickness much enfeebled
my numbers lessen'd and those few I have
almost no better than so many French
who when they were in health I tell thee herald
I thought upon one pair of English legs
did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God
that I do brag thus this your air of France
hath blown that vice in me I must repent
go therefore tell thy master here I am
my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
yet God before tell him we will come on
though France himself and such another neighbour
stand in our way There's for thy labour Montjoy
go bid thy master well advise himself
if we may pass we will if we be hinder'd
we shall your tawny ground with your red blood
discolour and so Montjoy fare you well
the sum of all our answer is but this
we would not seek a battle as we are
nor as we are we say we will not shun it
so tell your master

I shall deliver so Thanks to your highness


I hope they will not come upon us now

we are in God's hand brother not in theirs
march to the bridge it now draws toward night
and on to-morrow bid them march away


tut I have the best armour of the world Would it were day

you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due

it is the best horse of Europe

will it never be morning

my Lord of Orleans and my lord high constable you talk of horse and armour

you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world

what a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns a ha He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus qui a les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I am a hawk he trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes

he's of the colour of the nutmeg


indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse

it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage

no more cousin

nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus Wonder of nature

I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress

then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser for my horse is my mistress

your mistress bears well

me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress

ma foi methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back


mine was not bridled

O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your straight strossers

you have good judgment in horsemanship

be warned by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my mistress

I had as lief have my mistress a jade

I tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair

I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress

le chien est retourn son propre vomissement et la truie lav e au bourbier thou makest use of any thing

yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose


stars my lord

some of them will fall to-morrow I hope

and yet my sky shall not want

that may be for you bear a many superfluously and twere more honour some were away

even as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted

would I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot to-morrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English faces

I will not say so for fear I should be faced out of my way But I would it were morning for I would fain be about the ears of the English

who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners

you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them



the Dauphin longs for morning

he longs to eat the English

I think he will eat all he kills

by the white hand of my lady he's a gallant prince

swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath

he is simply the most active gentleman of France

doing is activity and he will still be doing

he never did harm that I heard of

nor will do none to-morrow he will keep that good name still
I know him to be valiant

I was told that by one that knows him better than you

what's he

marry he told me so himself and he said he cared not who knew it

he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him

by my faith sir but it is never any body saw it but his lackey tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate

'Ill will never said well

I will cap that proverb with There is flattery in friendship

and I will take up that with Give the devil his due

well placed there stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with A pox of the devil
you are the better at proverbs by how much A fool's bolt is soon shot

you have shot over

'Tis not the first time you were overshot


my lord high constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents

who hath measured the ground

the Lord Grandpr

a valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we do

what a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England to mope with his fatbrained followers so far out of his knowledge

if the English had any apprehension they would run away


that island of England breeds very valiant creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage

foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples You may as well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion

just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils

ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef

then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm come shall we about it

it is now two o'clock but let me see by ten
we shall have each a hundred Englishmen


now entertain conjecture of a time
when creeping murmur and the poring dark
fills the wide vessel of the universe
from camp to camp through the foul womb of night
that the fix'd sentinels almost receive
the secret whispers of each other's watch
fire answers fire and through their paly flames
each battle sees the other's umber'd face
steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents
the armourers accomplishing the knights
with busy hammers closing rivets up
give dreadful note of preparation
the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll
and the third hour of drowsy morning name
proud of their numbers and secure in soul
the confident and over-lusty French
do the low-rated English play at dice
and chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
so tediously away The poor condemned English
like sacrifices by their watchful fires
sit patiently and inly ruminate
investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats
presenteth them unto the gazing moon
so many horrid ghosts O now who will behold
the royal captain of this ruin'd band
walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
let him cry Praise and glory on his head
for forth he goes and visits all his host
bids them good morrow with a modest smile
and calls them brothers friends and countrymen
upon his royal face there is no note
how dread an army hath enrounded him
nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
unto the weary and all-watched night
but freshly looks and overbears attaint
with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
that every wretch pining and pale before
beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
a largess universal like the sun
his liberal eye doth give to every one
behold as may unworthiness define
a little touch of Harry in the night
and so our scene must to the battle fly
where O for pity we shall much disgrace
with four or five most vile and ragged foils
right ill dispos'd in brawl ridiculous
the name of Agincourt Yet sit and see
minding true things by what their mockeries be

Gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
the greater therefore should our courage be
good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty
there is some soul of goodness in things evil
would men observingly distil it out
for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
which is both healthful and good husbandry
besides they are our outward consciences
and preachers to us all admonishing
that we should dress us fairly for our end
and make a moral of the devil himself


good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham
a good soft pillow for that good white head

were better than a churlish turf of France

not so my liege this lodging likes me better
since I may say Now lie I like a king

'Tis good for men to love their present pains
upon example so the spirit is eas'd
and when the mind is quicken'd out of doubt
the organs though defunct and dead before
break up their drowsy grave and newly move
with casted slough and fresh legerity
lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both
commend me to the princes in our camp
desire them all to my pavilion

we shall my liege


shall I attend your Grace

no my good knight
go with my brothers to my lords of England
I and my bosom must debate awhile
and then I would no other company

the Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry


God-a-mercy old heart thou speak'st cheerfully


qui va l
a friend

discuss unto me art thou officer
or art thou base common and popular

I am a gentleman of a company

trail'st thou the puissant pike

even so What are you

as good a gentleman as the emperor

then you are a better than the king

the king's a bawcock and a heart of gold
a lad of life an imp of fame
of parents good of fist most valiant
I kiss his dirty shoe and from my heart-string

Harry le Roy

le Roy a Cornish name art thou of Cornish crew

no I am a Welshman

know'st thou Fluellen

yes

tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate
upon Saint Davy's day

do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours

art thou his friend

and his kinsman too
the figo for thee then

I thank you God be with you

my name is Pistol called


it sorts well with your fierceness

captain Fluellen

sol in the name of Cheshu Christ speak lower It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and auncient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddle-taddle nor pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp I warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise

why the enemy is loud you heard him all night

if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own conscience now

I will speak lower



though it appear a little out of fashion
there is much care and valour in this Welshman


brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder

I think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day

we see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we shall never see the end of it Who goes there

a friend

under what captain serve you

under Sir Thomas Erpingham

a good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray you what thinks he of our estate
even as men wracked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide

he hath not told his thought to the king

no nor it is not meet he should For though I speak it to you I think the king is but a man as I am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army

he may show what outward courage he will but I believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here

by my troth I will speak my conscience of the king I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is

then I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor men's lives saved

I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king's company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable

that's more than we know

ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the king's subjects If his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us

but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all We died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection
so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation But this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services Besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from God war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punished for before-breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited Every subject's duty is the king's but every subject's soul is his own Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare

'Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer it

I do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine to fight lustily for him

I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed

ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser

if I live to see it I will never trust his word after

you pay him then That's a perilous shot out of an elder-gun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather You'll never trust his word after come tis a foolish saying

your reproof is something too round I should be angry with you if the time were convenient

let it be a quarrel between us if you live

I embrace it
how shall I know thee again

give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it I will make it my quarrel

here's my glove give me another of thine

there

this will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after to-morrow This is my glove by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear

if ever I live to see it I will challenge it

thou darest as well be hanged

well I will do it though I take thee in the king's company

keep thy word fare thee well

be friends you English fools be friends we have French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no English treason to cut French crowns and to-morrow the king himself will be a clipper

upon the king let us our lives our souls
our debts our careful wives
our children and our sins lay on the king
we must bear all O hard condition
twin-born with greatness subject to the breath
of every fool whose sense no more can feel
but his own wringing What infinite heart's ease
must kings neglect that private men enjoy
and what have kings that privates have not too
save ceremony save general ceremony
and what art thou thou idle ceremony
what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more
of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
what are thy rents what are thy comings-in
O ceremony show me but thy worth
what is thy soul of adoration
art thou aught else but place degree and form
wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
than they in fearing
what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet
but poison'd flattery O be sick great greatness
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
with titles blown from adulation
will it give place to flexure and low-bending
canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee
command the health of it No thou proud dream
that play'st so subtly with a king's repose
I am a king that find thee and I know
'Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
the sword the mace the crown imperial
the intertissued robe of gold and pearl
the farced title running fore the king
the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
that beats upon the high shore of this world
no not all these thrice-gorgeous ceremony
can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread
never sees horrid night the child of hell
but like a lackey from the rise to set
sweats in the eye of Ph bus and all night
sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn
doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse
and follows so the ever-running year
with profitable labour to his grave
and but for ceremony such a wretch
winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
had the fore-hand and vantage of a king
the slave a member of the country's peace
enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
whose hours the peasant best advantages


seek through your camp to find you

good old knight
collect them all together at my tent
I'll be before thee

I shall do't my lord


O God of battles steel my soldiers' hearts
possess them not with fear take from them now
the sense of reckoning if the opposed numbers
pluck their hearts from them Not to-day O Lord
O not to-day think not upon the fault
my father made in compassing the crown
I Richard's body have interr'd anew
and on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
than from it issu'd forced drops of blood
five hundred poor I have in yearly pay
toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built
two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
sing still for Richard's soul More will I do
though all that I can do is nothing worth
since that my penitence comes after all
imploring pardon


my liege

my brother Gloucester's voice Ay
I know thy errand I will go with thee
the day my friends and all things stay for me


the sun doth gild our armour up my lords

montez cheval My horse varlet lacquais ha


Via les eaux et la terre

rien puis l'air et le feu

ciel cousin Orleans

now my lord constable

hark how our steeds for present service neigh

mount them and make incision in their hides
that their hot blood may spin in English eyes
and dout them with superfluous courage ha

what will you have them weep our horses' blood
how shall we then behold their natural tears



to horse you gallant princes straight to horse
do but behold yon poor and starved band
and your fair show shall suck away their souls
leaving them but the shales and husks of men
there is not work enough for all our hands
scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
to give each naked curtal-axe a stain
that our French gallants shall to-day draw out
and sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on them
the vapour of our valour will o'erturn them
'Tis positive gainst all exceptions lords
that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
who in unnecessary action swarm
about our squares of battle were enow
to purge this field of such a hilding foe
though we upon this mountain's basis by
took stand for idle speculation
but that our honours must not What's to say
and all is done Then let the trumpets sound
the tucket sonance and the note to mount
for our approach shall so much dare the field
that England shall couch down in fear and yield


why do you stay so long my lords of France
yon island carrions desperate of their bones
ill-favour'dly become the morning field
their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
and our air shakes them passing scornfully
big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
with torch-staves in their hand and their poor jades
lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
the gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
lies foul with chew'd grass still and motionless
fly o'er them all impatient for their hour
description cannot suit itself in words
to demonstrate the life of such a battle
in life so lifeless as it shows itself

they have said their prayers and they stay for death

shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
and give their fasting horses provender
and after fight with them

I stay but for my guard on to the field
I will the banner from a trumpet take
and use it for my haste Come come away
the sun is high and we outwear the day


where is the king


of fighting men they have full three-score thousand

there's five to one besides they all are fresh

God's arm strike with us tis a fearful odds
God be wi' you princes all I'll to my charge
if we no more meet till we meet in heaven
then joyfully my noble Lord of Bedford
my dear Lord Gloucester and my good Lord Exeter
and my kind kinsman warriors all adieu

farewell good Salisbury and good luck go with thee

farewell kind lord Fight valiantly to-day
and yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it
for thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valour


princely in both


O that we now had here
but one ten thousand of those men in England
that do no work to-day

what's he that wishes so
my cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin
if we are mark'd to die we are enow
to do our country loss and if to live
the fewer men the greater share of honour
God's will I pray thee wish not one man more
by Jove I am not covetous for gold
nor care I who doth feed upon my cost
it yearns me not if men my garments wear
such outward things dwell not in my desires
but if it be a sin to covet honour
I am the most offending soul alive
God's peace I would not lose so great an honour
as one man more methinks would share from me
for the best hope I have O do not wish one more
rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host
that he which hath no stomach to this fight
let him depart his passport shall be made
and crowns for convoy put into his purse
we would not die in that man's company
that fears his fellowship to die with us
this day is call'd the feast of Crispian
he that outlives this day and comes safe home
will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd
and rouse him at the name of Crispian
he that shall live this day and see old age
will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
and say To-morrow is Saint Crispian
then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
and say These wounds I had on Crispin's day
old men forget yet all shall be forgot
what feats he did that day Then shall our names
familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king Bedford and Exeter
Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester
be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd
this story shall the good man teach his son
and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by
from this day to the ending of the world
but we in it shall be remembered
we few we happy few we band of brothers
for he to-day that sheds his blood with me
shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile
this day shall gentle his condition
and gentlemen in England now a-bed
shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here
and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
that fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day


the French are bravely in their battles set
and will with all expedience charge on us

all things are ready if our minds be so

perish the man whose mind is backward now

thou dost not wish more help from England coz

God's will my liege would you and I alone
without more help could fight this royal battle

why now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men
which likes me better than to wish us one
you know your places God be with you all


once more I come to know of thee King Harry
if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
for certainly thou art so near the gulf
thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy
the constable desires thee thou wilt mind
thy followers of repentance that their souls
may make a peaceful and a sweet retire
from off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
must lie and fester

who hath sent thee now

the Constable of France

I pray thee bear my former answer back
bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
good God why should they mock poor fellows thus
the man that once did sell the lion's skin
while the beast liv'd was kill'd with hunting him
a many of our bodies shall no doubt
find native graves upon the which I trust
and those that leave their valiant bones in France
dying like men though buried in your dung-hills
they shall be fam'd for there the sun shall greet them
and draw their honours reeking up to heaven
leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
the smell whereof shall breed a plague in France
mark then abounding valour in our English
that being dead like to the bullet's grazing
break out into a second course of mischief
killing in relapse of mortality
let me speak proudly tell the constable
we are but warriors for the working-day
our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
with rainy marching in the painful field
there's not a piece of feather in our host
good argument I hope we will not fly
and time hath worn us into slovenry
but by the mass our hearts are in the trim
and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
the gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
and turn them out of service If they do this
as if God please they shall my ransom then
will soon be levied Herald save thou thy labour
come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
they shall have none I swear but these my joints
which if they have as I will leave em them
shall yield them little tell the constable

I shall King Harry And so fare thee well
thou never shalt hear herald any more


I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom


my lord most humbly on my knee I beg
the leading of the vaward

and how thou pleasest God dispose the day


yield cur

peasant unless thou give me crowns brave crowns
or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword

O je vous supplie pour l'amour de
Dieu me pardonner Je suis le gentilhomme de bonne maison gardez ma vie et je vous donneray deux cents escus


he prays you to save his life he is a gentleman of a good house and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns

tell him my fury shall abate and I
the crowns will take

petit monsieur que dit-il

encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner aucan prisonnier neant-moins pour les escus que vous l'avez promis il est content de vous donner la liberte le franchisement

sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remerciemens et je m'estime heureux que je suis tomb entre les mains d'un chevalier je pense le plus brave valiant et tr s distingu seigneur d'Angleterre

expound unto me boy

he gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks and he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into the hands of one as he thinks the most brave valorous and thrice-worthy signieur of England

as I suck blood I will some mercy show
follow me

suivez vous le grand capitaine I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart but the saying is true The empty vessel makes the greatest sound Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i' the old play that every one may pare his nails with a wooden dagger and they are both hanged and so would this be if he durst steal anything adventurously I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp the French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it for there is none to guard it but boys


O seigneur le jour est perdu tout est perdu

mort de ma vie all is confounded all
reproach and everlasting shame
sit mocking in our plumes O meschante fortune
do not run away


why all our ranks are broke

O perdurable shame let's stab ourselves
be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for

is this the king we sent to for his ransom

shame and eternal shame nothing but shame
and he that will not follow Bourbon now
let him go hence and with his cap in hand
like a base pander hold the chamber-door
whilst by a slave no gentler than my dog
his fairest daughter is contaminated

disorder that hath spoil'd us friend us now
let us on heaps go offer up our lives

we are enough yet living in the field
to smother up the English in our throngs
if any order might be thought upon

the devil take order now I'll to the throng
let life be short else shame will be too long


well have we done thrice-valiant countrymen
but all's not done yet keep the French the field
the Duke of York commends him to your majesty

lives he good uncle thrice within this hour
I saw him down thrice up again and fighting
from helmet to the spur all blood he was

in which array brave soldier doth he lie
larding the plain and by his bloody side
yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds
the noble Earl of Suffolk also lies
Suffolk first died and York all haggled over
comes to him where in gore he lay insteep'd
and takes him by the beard kisses the gashes
that bloodily did yawn upon his face
and cries aloud Tarry dear cousin Suffolk
my soul shall thine keep company to heaven
tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast
as in this glorious and well-foughten field
we kept together in our chivalry
he smil'd me in the face raught me his hand
and with a feeble gripe says Dear my lord
commend my service to my sovereign
so did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
he threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips
and so espous'd to death with blood he seal'd
a testament of noble-ending love
the pretty and sweet manner of it forc'd
those waters from me which I would have stopp'd
but I had not so much of man in me
and all my mother came into mine eyes
and gave me up to tears

I blame you not
for hearing this I must perforce compound
with mistful eyes or they will issue too

but hark what new alarum is this same
the French have reinforc'd their scatter'd men
give the word through


kill the poys and the luggage tis expressly against the law of arms tis as arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can be offer't in your conscience now is it not

'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle have done this slaughter besides they have burned and carried away all that was in the king's tent wherefore the king most worthily hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat O tis a gallant king

ay he was porn at Monmouth Captain Gower What call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born

Alexander the Great

why I pray you is not pig great The pig or the great or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous are all one reckonings save the phrase is a little variations

I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon his father was called Philip of Macedon as I take it

I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn I tell you captain if you look in the maps of the orld I warrant you sall find in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth that the situations look you is both alike There is a river in Macedon and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth it is called Wye at Monmouth but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river but tis all one tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers and there is salmons in both If you mark Alexander's life well Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well for there is figures in all things Alexander God knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and his angers look you kill his pest friend Cleitus

our king is not like him in that he never killed any of his friends


sir John Falstaff

that is he I'll tell you there is goot men porn at Monmouth

here comes his majesty

I was not angry since I came to France
until this instant Take a trumpet herald
ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill
if they will fight with us bid them come down
or void the field they do offend our sight
if they'll do neither we will come to them
and make them skirr away as swift as stones
enforced from the old Assyrian slings
besides we'll cut the throats of those we have
and not a man of them that we shall take
shall taste our mercy Go and tell them so

here comes the herald of the French my liege

his eyes are humbler than they us'd to be

how now what means this herald know'st thou not
that I have fin'd these bones of mine for ransom
com'st thou again for ransom

no great king
I come to thee for charitable licence
that we may wander o'er this bloody field
to book our dead and then to bury them
to sort our nobles from our common men
for many of our princes woe the while
lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood
so do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
in blood of princes and their wounded steeds
fret fetlock-deep in gore and with wild rage
yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters
to view the field in safety and dispose
of their dead bodies

I tell thee truly herald
I know not if the day be ours or no
for yet a many of your horsemen peer
and gallop o'er the field

the day is yours

praised be God and not our strength for it
what is this castle call'd that stands hard by

they call it Agincourt

then call we this the field of Agincourt
fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus

now herald are the dead number'd

here is the number of the slaughter'd French


what prisoners of good sort are taken uncle

Charles Duke of Orleans nephew to the king
John Duke of Bourbon and Lord Bouciqualt
of other lords and barons knights and squires
full fifteen hundred besides common men

this note doth tell me of ten thousand French
that in the field lie slain of princes in this number
and nobles bearing banners there lie dead
of knights esquires and gallant gentlemen
eight thousand and four hundred of the which
five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights
so that in these ten thousand they have lost
there are but sixteen hundred mercenaries
the rest are princes barons lords knights squires
and gentlemen of blood and quality
the names of those their nobles that lie dead
Charles Delabreth High Constable of France
Jaques of Chatillon Admiral of France
the master of the cross-bows Lord Rambures
great-master of France the brave Sir Guischard Dauphin
John Duke of Alen on Antony Duke of Brabant
the brother to the Duke of Burgundy
and Edward Duke of Bar of lusty earls
Grandpr and Roussi Fauconberg and Foix
beaumont and Marle Vaudemont and Lestrale
here was a royal fellowship of death
where is the number of our English dead
Edward the Duke of York the Earl of Suffolk
sir Richard Ketly Davy Gam esquire
none else of name and of all other men
but five and twenty O God thy arm was here
and not to us but to thy arm alone
ascribe we all When without stratagem
but in plain shock and even play of battle
was ever known so great and little loss
on one part and on the other Take it God
for it is none but thine

'Tis wonderful

come go we in procession to the village
and be it death proclaimed through our host
to boast of this or take the praise from God
which is his only

is it not lawful an please your majesty to tell how many is killed
yes captain but with this acknowledgment
that God fought for us

yes my conscience he did us great good

do we all holy rites
let there be sung Non nobis and Te Deum
the dead with charity enclos'd in clay
we'll then to Calais and to England then
where ne'er from France arriv'd more happy men

vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
that I may prompt them and of such as have
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
of time of numbers and due course of things
which cannot in their huge and proper life
be here presented Now we bear the king
toward Calais grant him there there seen
heave him away upon your winged thoughts
pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth'd sea
which like a mighty whiffler fore the king
seems to prepare his way so let him land
and solemnly see him set on to London
so swift a pace hath thought that even now
you may imagine him upon Blackheath
where that his lords desire him to have borne
his bruised helmet and his bended sword
before him through the city he forbids it
being free from vainness and self-glorious pride
giving full trophy signal and ostent
quite from himself to God But now behold
in the quick forge and working-house of thought
how London doth pour out her citizens
the mayor and all his brethren in best sort
like to the senators of the antique Rome
with the plebeians swarming at their heels
go forth and fetch their conquering C sar in
were now the general of our gracious empress
as in good time he may from Ireland coming
bringing rebellion broached on his sword
how many would the peaceful city quit
to welcome him much more and much more cause
did they this Harry Now in London place him
as yet the lamentation of the French
invites the King of England's stay at home
the emperor's coming in behalf of France
to order peace between them and omit
all the occurrences whatever chanc'd
till Harry's back-return again to France
there must we bring him and myself have play'd
the interim by remembering you tis past
then brook abridgment and your eyes advance
after your thoughts straight back again to France

nay that's right but why wear you your leek to-day Saint Davy's day is past


why here he comes swelling like a turkey-cock


'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his turkey-cocks God pless you Aunchient Pistol you scurvy lousy knave God pless you

doth Fortune play the huswife with me now
of malady of France
and there my rendezvous is quite cut off
old I do wax and from my weary limbs
honour is cudgelled Well bawd I'll turn
and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand
to England will I steal and there I'll steal
and patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars
and swear I got them in the Gallia wars

peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
unto our brother France and to our sister
health and fair time of day joy and good wishes
to our most fair and princely cousin Katharine
and as a branch and member of this royalty
by whom this great assembly is contriv'd
we do salute you Duke of Burgundy
and princes French and peers health to you all

right joyous are we to behold your face
so are you princes English every one

so happy be the issue brother England
of this good day and of this gracious meeting
as we are now glad to behold your eyes
your eyes which hitherto have borne in them
against the French that met them in their bent
the fatal balls of murdering basilisks
the venom of such looks we fairly hope
have lost their quality and that this day
shall change all griefs and quarrels into love

to cry amen to that thus we appear

you English princes all I do salute you

my duty to you both on equal love
great Kings of France and England That I have labour'd
with all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
unto this bar and royal interview
your mightiness on both parts best can witness
since then my office hath so far prevail'd
that face to face and royal eye to eye
you have congreeted let it not disgrace me
if I demand before this royal view
what rub or what impediment there is
why that the naked poor and mangled Peace
dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births
should not in this best garden of the world
our fertile France put up her lovely visage
alas she hath from France too long been chas'd
and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
corrupting in its own fertility
her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
unpruned dies her hedges even-pleach'd
like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas
the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
that should deracinate such savagery
the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
conceives by idleness and nothing teems
but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
losing both beauty and utility
and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
defective in their natures grow to wildness
even so our houses and ourselves and children
have lost or do not learn for want of time
the sciences that should become our country
but grow like savages as soldiers will
that nothing do but meditate on blood
to swearing and stern looks diffus'd attire
and every thing that seems unnatural
which to reduce into our former favour
you are assembled and my speech entreats
that I may know the let why gentle Peace
and bless us with her former qualities

if Duke of Burgundy you would the peace
whose want gives growth to the imperfections
which you have cited you must buy that peace
with full accord to all our just demands
whose tenours and particular effects
you have enschedul'd briefly in your hands

the king hath heard them to the which as yet
there is no answer made

well then the peace
which you before so urg'd lies in his answer

I have but with a cursorary eye
o'erglanc'd the articles pleaseth your Grace
to appoint some of your council presently
to sit with us once more with better heed
pass our accept and peremptory answer

brother we shall Go uncle Exeter
and brother Clarence and you brother Gloucester
Warwick and Huntingdon go with the king
and take with you free power to ratify
augment or alter as your wisdoms best
shall see advantageable for our dignity
anything in or out of our demands
and we'll consign thereto Will you fair sister
go with the princes or stay here with us

our gracious brother I will go with them
haply a woman's voice may do some good
when articles too nicely urg'd be stood on

yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us
she is our capital demand compris'd
within the fore-rank of our articles
she hath good leave


fair Katharine and most fair
will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
such as will enter at a lady's ear
and plead his love-suit to her gentle heart

your majesty sall mock at me I cannot speak your England

O fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me Kate

pardonnez moy I cannot tell vat is like me

an angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel

que dit-il que je suis semblable les anges

ouy vrayment sauf vostre grace ainsi dit-il
I said so dear Katharine and I must not blush to affirm it

O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines des tromperies

what says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits

ouy dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de princess

the princess is the better Englishwoman I' faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say I love you then if you urge me further than to say Do you in faith I wear out my suit Give me your answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say you lady

sauf vostre honneur me understand vell

marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a lady at leap-frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into a wife Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack-an-apes never off But before God Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urged nor never break for urging If thou caust love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sun-burning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou livest dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rime themselves into ladies' favours they do always reason themselves out again What a speaker is but a prater a rime is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king And what sayest thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly I pray thee

is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France

no it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine

I cannot tell vat is dat
no Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de moy let me see what then Saint Denis be my speed donc vostre est France et vous estes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me

sauf vostre honneur le Fran ois que vous parlez est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle

no faith is't not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much English Canst thou love me

I cannot tell

can any of your neighbours tell Kate I'll ask them Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because I love thee cruelly If ever thou be'st mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder Shall not thou and I between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard shall we not what sayest thou my fair flower-de-luce

I do not know dat

no tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katharine du monde mon tr s cher et divine d esse

your majest ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France

now fie upon my false French By mine honour in true English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer-up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better And therefore tell me most fair Katharine will you have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say Harry of England I am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet is thine who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy English broken therefore queen of all Katharine break thy mind to me in broken English wilt thou have me

dat is as it sall please de roy mon p re
nay it will please him well Kate it shall please him Kate

den it sall also content me

upon that I kiss your hand and I call you my queen

laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez Ma foy je ne veux point que vous abaissez vostre grandeur en baisant la main d'une vostre indigne serviteure excusez moy je vous supplie mon tr s puissant seigneur

then I will kiss your lips Kate

les dames et demoiselles pour estre bais es devant leur noces il n'est pas la coutume de France

madam my interpreter what says she

dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France I cannot tell what is baiser in English

to kiss

your majesty entendre bettre que moy
it is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married would she say

ouy vrayment

O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion we are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouths of all find-faults as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding

. You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father

God save your majesty My royal cousin teach you our princess English

I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good English

is she not apt

our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness

pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to

yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces
they are then excused my lord when they see not what they do

then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking

I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summered and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomew-tide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on

this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too

as love is my lord before it loves

it is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way

yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered

shall Kate be my wife

so please you

I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will
we have consented to all terms of reason

is't so my lords of England

the king hath granted every article
his daughter first and then in sequel all
according to their firm proposed natures

only he hath not yet subscribed this
where your majesty demands that the King of France having any occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your highness in this form and with this addition in French Notre tr s cher filz Henry roy d'Angleterre H retier de France and thus in Latin Pr clarissimus filius noster Henricus Rex Angli et H res Franci

nor this I have not brother so denied
but your request shall make me let it pass

I pray you then in love and dear alliance
let that one article rank with the rest
and thereupon give me your daughter

take her fair son and from her blood raise up
of France and England whose very shores look pale
with envy of each other's happiness
may cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
in their sweet bosoms that never war advance
his bleeding sword twixt England and fair France

amen

now welcome Kate and bear me witness all
that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen


God the best maker of all marriages
combine your hearts in one your realms in one
as man and wife being two are one in love
so be there twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
that never may ill office or fell jealousy
which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
to make divorce of their incorporate league
that English may as French French Englishmen
receive each other God speak this Amen

amen

prepare we for our marriage on which day
my Lord of Burgundy we'll take your oath
and all the peers' for surety of our leagues
then shall I swear to Kate and you to me
and may our oaths well kept and prosperous be

thus far with rough and all-unable pen
our bending author hath pursu'd the story
in little room confining mighty men
mangling by starts the full course of their glory
small time but in that small most greatly liv'd
this star of England Fortune made his sword
by which the world's best garden he achiev'd
Henry the Sixth in infant bands crown'd King
of France and England did this king succeed
whose state so many had the managing
that they lost France and made his England bleed
which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake
in your fair minds let this acceptance take

THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV


open your ears for which of you will stop
the vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks
I from the orient to the drooping west
making the wind my post-horse still unfold
the acts commenced on this ball of earth
upon my tongues continual slanders ride
the which in every language I pronounce
stuffing the ears of men with false reports
I speak of peace while covert enmity
and who but Rumour who but only I
make fearful musters and prepar'd defence
whilst the big year swoln with some other grief
is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
and no such matter Rumour is a pipe
blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
and of so easy and so plain a stop
that the blunt monster with uncounted heads
the still-discordant wavering multitude
can play upon it But what need I thus
my well-known body to anatomize
among my household Why is Rumour here
I run before King Harry's victory
who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops
quenching the flame of bold rebellion
even with the rebels' blood But what mean I
to speak so true at first my office is
to noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
and that the king before the Douglas' rage
stoop'd his anointed head as low as death
this have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
between the royal field of Shrewsbury
and this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone
where Hotspur's father old Northumberland
lies crafty-sick The posts come tiring on
and not a man of them brings other news
than they have learn'd of me from Rumour's tongues
they bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs


who keeps the gate here ho

where is the earl

what shall I say you are

tell thou the earl

his Lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard
please it your honour knock but at the gate
and he himself will answer


here comes the earl


what news Lord Bardolph every minute now
should be the father of some stratagem
the times are wild contention like a horse
full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
and bears down all before him

noble earl
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury

good an God will
as good as heart can wish
the king is almost wounded to the death
and in the fortune of my lord your son
prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts
kill'd by the hand of Douglas young Prince John
and Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field
and Harry Monmouth's brawn the hulk Sir John
is prisoner to your son O such a day
so fought so follow'd and so fairly won
came not till now to dignify the times
since C sar's fortunes

how is this deriv'd
saw you the field came you from Shrewsbury

I spake with one my lord that came from thence
a gentleman well bred and of good name
that freely render'd me these news for true

on Tuesday last to listen after news

my lord I over-rode him on the way
and he is furnish'd with no certainties
more than he haply may retail from me


now Travers what good tidings come with you

my lord Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
with joyful tidings and being better hors'd
out-rode me After him came spurring hard
a gentleman almost forspent with speed
that stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
he ask'd the way to Chester and of him
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury
he told me that rebellion had bad luck
and that young Harry Percy's spur was cold
with that he gave his able horse the head
against the panting sides of his poor jade
up to the rowel-head and starting so
he seem'd in running to devour the way
staying no longer question

ha Again
said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold
of Hotspur Coldspur that rebellion
had met ill luck

my lord I'll tell you what
if my young lord your son have not the day
upon mine honour for a silken point
I'll give my barony never talk of it

why should the gentleman that rode by Travers
give then such instances of loss

who he
the horse he rode on and upon my life
spoke at a venture Look here comes more news


yea this man's brow like to a title-leaf
foretells the nature of a tragic volume
so looks the strond whereon the imperious flood
hath left a witness'd usurpation
say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury

I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord
where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
to fright our party

how doth my son and brother
thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
even such a man so faint so spiritless
so dull so dead in look so woe-begone
and would have told him half his Troy was burn'd
but Priam found the fire ere he his tongue
and I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it
this thou wouldst say Your son did thus and thus
your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas
stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
but in the end to stop mine ear indeed
thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
ending with Brother son and all are dead

Douglas is living and your brother yet
but for my lord your son

why he is dead
see what a ready tongue suspicion hath
he that but fears the thing he would not know
hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
that what he fear'd is chanced Yet speak Morton
tell thou thy earl his divination lies
and make thee rich for doing me such wrong

you are too great to be by me gainsaid
your spirit is too true your fears too certain

yet for all this say not that Percy's dead
I see a strange confession in thine eye
thou shak'st thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
to speak a truth If he be slain say so
the tongue offends not that reports his death
and he doth sin that doth belie the dead
not he which says the dead is not alive
yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
hath but a losing office and his tongue
sounds ever after as a sullen bell
remember'd knolling a departing friend

I cannot think my lord your son is dead

that which I would to God I had not seen
but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreath'd
to Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
the never-daunted Percy to the earth
from whence with life he never more sprung up
in few his death whose spirit lent a fire
even to the dullest peasant in his camp
being bruited once took fire and heat away
from the best-temper'd courage in his troops
for from his metal was his party steel'd
which once in him abated all the rest
turn'd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
and as the thing that's heavy in itself
upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
so did our men heavy in Hotspur's loss
lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious Scot
the bloody Douglas whose well-labouring sword
had three times slain the appearance of the king
'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
of those that turn'd their backs and in his flight
stumbling in fear was took The sum of all
is that the king hath won and hath sent out
a speedy power to encounter you my lord
under the conduct of young Lancaster
and Westmoreland This is the news at full

for this I shall have time enough to mourn
in poison there is physic and these news
having been well that would have made me sick
being sick have in some measure made me well
and as the wretch whose fever-weaken'd joints
like strengthless hinges buckle under life
impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs
are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch
a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif
thou art a guard too wanton for the head
which princes flesh'd with conquest aim to hit
now bind my brows with iron and approach
the ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
to frown upon the enrag'd Northumberland
let heaven kiss earth now let not nature's hand
keep the wild flood confin'd let order die
and let this world no longer be a stage
to feed contention in a lingering act
but let one spirit of the first-born Cain
reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
on bloody courses the rude scene may end
and darkness be the burier of the dead

this strained passion doth you wrong my lord


the lives of all your loving complices
lean on your health the which if you give o'er
to stormy passion must perforce decay
you cast the event of war my noble lord
and summ'd the account of chance before you said
'Let us make head It was your presurmise
that in the dole of blows your son might drop
you knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge
more likely to fall in than to get o'er
you were advis'd his flesh was capable
of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd
yet did you say Go forth and none of this
though strongly apprehended could restrain
the stiff-borne action what hath then befallen
or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
more than that being which was like to be

knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous seas
that if we wrought out life twas ten to one
and yet we ventur'd for the gain propos'd
chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd
and since we are o'erset venture again
come we will all put forth body and goods

'Tis more than time and my most noble lord
I hear for certain and do speak the truth
the gentle Archbishop of York is up
with well-appointed powers he is a man
who with a double surety binds his followers
my lord your son had only but the corpse'
but shadows and the shows of men to fight
for that same word rebellion did divide
the action of their bodies from their souls
and they did fight with queasiness constrain'd
as men drink potions that their weapons only
seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls
as fish are in a pond But now the bishop
turns insurrection to religion
suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts
he's follow'd both with body and with mind
and doth enlarge his rising with the blood
of fair King Richard scrap'd from Pomfret stones
derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
gasping for life under great Bolingbroke
and more and less do flock to follow him

I knew of this before but to speak truth
this present grief had wip'd it from my mind
go in with me and counsel every man
the aptest way for safety and revenge
get posts and letters and make friends with speed
never so few and never yet more need



he said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but for the party that owed it he might have more diseases than he knew for

men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the brain of this foolish-compounded clay man is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one If the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then I have no judgment Thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never manned with an agate till now but I will set you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is not yet fledged I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face-royal God may finish it when he will it is not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still as a face-royal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it and yet he will be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor He may keep his own grace but he is almost out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and my slops

he said sir you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph he would not take his bond and yours he liked not the security

let him be damned like the glutton may his tongue be hotter A whoreson Achitophel a rascally yea-forsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is thorough with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security I looked a' should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me security Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him Where's Bardolph

he's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse

I bought him in Paul's and he'll buy me a horse in Smithfield an I could get me but a wife in the stews I were manned horsed and wived


sir here comes the nobleman that committed the prince for striking him about Bardolph

wait close I will not see him

what's he that goes there
Falstaff an't please your lordship

he that was in question for the robbery

he my lord but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury and as I hear is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster

what to York Call him back again

sir John Falstaff

boy tell him I am deaf

you must speak louder my master is deaf

I am sure he is to the hearing of anything good Go pluck him by the elbow I must speak with him

sir John

what a young knave and beg Is there not wars is there not employment doth not the king lack subjects do not the rebels want soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it
you mistake me sir

why sir did I say you were an honest man setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I had said so

I pray you sir then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man

I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which grows to me If thou gett'st any leave of me hang me if thou takest leave thou wert better be hanged You hunt-counter hence avaunt

sir my lord would speak with you

sir John Falstaff a word with you

my good lord God give your lordship good time of day I am glad to see your lordship abroad I heard say your lordship was sick I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice Your lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health

sir John I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury

an't please your lordship I hear his majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales

I talk not of his majesty You would not come when I sent for you
and I hear moreover his highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy

well heaven mend him I pray you let me speak with you

this apoplexy is as I take it a kind of lethargy an't please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson tingling

what tell you me of it be it as it is

it hath its original from much grief from study and perturbation of the brain I have read the cause of his effects in Galen it is a kind of deafness

I think you are fallen into the disease for you hear not what I say to you

very well my lord very well rather an't please you it is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that I am troubled withal

to punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears and I care not if I do become your physician

I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itself

I sent for you when there were matters against you for your life to come speak with me
as I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service I did not come

well the truth is Sir John you live in great infamy

he that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less

your means are very slender and your waste is great

I would it were otherwise I would my means were greater and my waist slenderer

you have misled the youthful prince

the young prince hath misled me I am the fellow with the great belly and he my dog

well I am loath to gall a new-healed wound your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night's exploit on Gadshill you may thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting that action

my lord

but since all is well keep it so wake not a sleeping wolf
to wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox

what you are as a candle the better part burnt out

a wassail candle my lord all tallow if I did say of wax my growth would approve the truth

there is not a white hair on your face but should have his effect of gravity

his effect of gravy gravy gravy

you follow the young prince up and down like his ill angel

not so my lord your ill angel is light but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing and yet in some respects I grant I cannot go I cannot tell Virtue is of so little regard in these costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young you measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our youth I must confess are wags too

do you set down your name in the scroll of youth that are written down old with all the characters of age Have you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an increasing belly Is not your voice broken your wind short your chin double your wit single and every part about you blasted with antiquity and will you yet call yourself young Fie fie fie Sir John

my lord I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a white head and something a round belly For my voice I have lost it with hollaing and singing of anthems To approve my youth further I will not the truth is I am only old in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him For the box o' the ear that the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord I have checked him for it and the young lion repents marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk and old sack

well God send the prince a better companion
God send the companion a better prince I cannot rid my hands of him

well the king hath severed you and Prince Harry I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland

yea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it But look you pray all you that kiss my lady Peace at home that our armies join not in a hot day for by the Lord I take but two shirts out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily if it be a hot day and I brandish anything but my bottle I would I might never spit white again There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it Well I cannot last ever But it was always yet the trick of our English nation if they have a good thing to make it too common If you will needs say I am an old man you should give me rest I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be eaten to death with rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion

well be honest be honest and God bless your expedition

will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth

not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to bear crosses Fare you well commend me to my cousin Westmoreland


if I do fillip me with a three-man beetle A man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the other and so both the degrees prevent my curses Boy

sir

what money is in my purse


I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease is incurable Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster this to the prince this to the Earl of Westmoreland and this to old Mistress Ursula whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair on my chin About it you know where to find me

a pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe Tis no matter if I do halt I have the wars for my colour and my pension shall seem the more reasonable A good wit will make use of anything I will turn diseases to commodity


thus have you heard our cause and known our means
and my most noble friends I pray you all
speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
and first Lord Marshal what say you to it

I well allow the occasion of our arms
but gladly would be better satisfied
how in our means we should advance ourselves
to look with forehead bold and big enough
upon the power and puissance of the king

our present musters grow upon the file
to five-and-twenty thousand men of choice
of great Northumberland whose bosom burns
with an incensed fire of injuries

the question then Lord Hastings standeth thus
whether our present five-and-twenty thousand
may hold up head without Northumberland

with him we may

ay marry there's the point
but if without him we be thought too feeble
my judgment is we should not step too far
till we had his assistance by the hand
for in a theme so bloody-fao'd as this
conjecture expectation and surmise
of aids incertain should not be admitted

'Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed
it was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury
it was my lord who lin'd himself with hope
eating the air on promise of supply
flattering himself with project of a power
much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
and so with great imagination
proper to madmen led his powers to death
and winking leap'd into destruction

but by your leave it never yet did hurt
to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope

yes if this present quality of war
indeed the instant action a cause on foot
lives so in hope as in an early spring
we see the appearing buds which to prove fruit
hope gives not so much warrant as despair
that frosts will bite them When we mean to build
we first survey the plot then draw the model
and when we see the figure of the house
which if we find outweighs ability
what do we then but draw anew the model
in fewer offices or at last desist
to build at all Much more in this great work
which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
and set another up should we survey
the plot of situation and the model
consent upon a sure foundation
question surveyors know our own estate
how able such a work to undergo
to weigh against his opposite or else
we fortify in paper and in figures
using the names of men instead of men
like one that draws the model of a house
beyond his power to build it who half through
gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
a naked-subject to the weeping clouds
and waste for churlish winter's tyranny

should be still-born and that we now possess'd
the utmost man of expectation
I think we are a body strong enough
even as we are to equal with the king

what is the king but five-and-twenty thousand

to us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph
for his divisions as the times do brawl
are in three heads one power against the French
and one against Glendower perforce a third
must take up us so is the unfirm king
in three divided and his coffers sound
with hollow poverty and emptiness

that he should draw his several strengths together
and come against us in full puissance
need not be dreaded

he leaves his back unarm'd the French and Welsh
baying him at the heels never fear that

who is it like should lead his forces hither

the Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland
against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth
but who is substituted gainst the French
I have no certain notice

let us on
and publish the occasion of our arms
the commonwealth is sick of their own choice
their over-greedy love hath surfeited
a habitation giddy and unsure
hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
O thou fond many with what loud applause
didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
before he was what thou wouldst have him be
thou beastly feeder art so full of him
that thou provok'st thyself to cast him up
so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard
and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
and howl'st to find it What trust is in these times
they that when Richard liv'd would have him die
are now become enamour'd on his grave
thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
when through proud London he came sighing on
after the admired heels of Bolingbroke
cry'st now O earth yield us that king again
and take thou this O thoughts of men accurst
past and to come seem best things present worst

shall we go draw our numbers and set on

we are time's subjects and time bids be gone


it is entered

where's your yeoman Is it a lusty yeoman will a' stand to't

sirrah where's Snare

O Lord ay good Master Snare

here here

Snare we must arrest Sir John Falstaff

yea good Master Snare I have entered him and all

it may chance cost some of us our lives for he will stab

alas the day take heed of him he stabbed me in mine own house and that most beastly In good faith he cares not what mischief he doth if his weapon be out he will foin like any devil he will spare neither man woman nor child


no nor I neither I'll be at your elbow

an I but fist him once an a' come but within my vice

I am undone by his going I warrant you he's an infinitive thing upon my score Good Master Fang hold him sure good Master Snare let him not scape A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner saving your manhoods to buy a saddle and he's indited to dinner to the Lubber's Head in Lumbert-Street to Master Smooth's the silkman I pray ye since my exion is entered and my case so openly known to the world let him be brought in to his answer A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear and I have borne and borne and borne and have been fubbed off and fubbed off and fubbed off from this day to that day that it is a shame to be thought on There is no honesty in such dealing unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast to bear every knave's wrong Yonder he comes and that arrant malmseynose knave Bardolph with him Do your offices do your offices Master Fang and Master Snare do me do me do me your offices


how now whose mare's dead what's the matter

sir John I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly

away varlets Draw Bardolph cut me off the villain's head throw the quean in the channel

throw me in the channel I'll throw thee in the channel Wilt thou wilt thou thou bastardly rogue Murder murder Ah thou honey-suckle villain wilt thou kill God's officers and the king's Ah thou honey-seed rogue thou art a honey-seed a man-queller and a woman-queller

keep them off Bardolph

a rescue a rescue
good people bring a rescue or two Thou wo't wo't thou thou wo't wo't ta do do thou rogue do thou hemp-seed

away you scullion you rampallian you fustilarian I'll tickle your catastrophe


what is the matter keep the peace here ho

good my lord be good to me I beseech you stand to me

how now Sir John what are you brawling here
doth this become your place your time and business
you should have been well on your way to York
stand from him fellow wherefore hang'st upon him

O my most worshipful lord an't please your grace I am a poor widow of Eastcheap and he is arrested at my suit

for what sum

it is more than for some my lord it is for all all I have He hath eaten me out of house and home he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his but I will have some of it out again or I will ride thee o' nights like the mare
I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have any vantage of ground to get up

how comes this Sir John Fie what man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own

what is the gross sum that I owe thee

marry if thou wert an honest man thyself and the money too Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet sitting in my Dolphin-chamber at the round table by a seacoal fire upon Wednesday in Wheeson week when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor thou didst swear to me then as I was washing thy wound to marry me and make me my lady thy wife Canst thou deny it Did not goodwife Keech the butcher's wife come in then and call me gossip Quickly coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar telling us she had a good dish of prawns whereby thou didst desire to eat some whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound And didst thou not when she was gone down-stairs desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people saying that ere long they should call me madam And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings I put thee now to thy book-oath deny it if thou canst

my lord this is a poor mad soul and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you She hath been in good case and the truth is poverty hath distracted her But for these foolish officers I beseech you I may have redress against them

sir John Sir John I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way It is not a confident brow nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you can thrust me from a level consideration you have as it appears to me practised upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person

yea in troth my lord

prithee peace Pay her the debt you owe her and unpay the villany you have done her the one you may do with sterling money and the other with current repentance

my lord I will not undergo this sneap without reply You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness if a man will make curtsy and say nothing he is virtuous No my lord my humble duty remembered I will not be your suitor I say to you I do desire deliverance from these officers being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs

you speak as having power to do wrong but answer in the effect of your reputation and satisfy the poor woman
come hither hostess

now Master Gower what news

the king my lord and Harry Prince of Wales
are near at hand the rest the paper tells


as I am a gentleman

nay you said so before

as I am a gentleman Come no more words of it

by this heavenly ground I tread on I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers

glasses glasses is the only drinking and for thy walls a pretty slight drollery or the story of the Prodigal or the German hunting in water-work is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these fly-bitten tapestries Let it be ten pound if thou canst Come an it were not for thy humours there is not a better wench in England Go wash thy face and draw thy action Come thou must not be in this humour with me dost not know me Come come I know thou wast set on to this

prithee Sir John let it be but twenty nobles i' faith I am loath to pawn my plate so God save me la
let it alone I'll make other shift you'll be a fool still

well you shall have it though I pawn my gown I hope you'll come to supper You'll pay me all together

will I live

go with her with her hook on hook on

will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper

no more words let's have her


I have heard better news

what's the news my good lord

where lay the king last night


I hope my lord all's well what is the news my lord

come all his forces back

no fifteen hundred foot five hundred horse
are march'd up to my Lord of Lancaster
against Northumberland and the archbishop

comes the king back from Wales my noble lord

you shall have letters of me presently
come go along with me good Master Gower

my lord

what's the matter

master Gower shall I entreat you with me to dinner
I must wait upon my good lord here
I thank you good Sir John

sir John you loiter here too long being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go

will you sup with me Master Gower

what foolish master taught you these manners Sir John

master Gower if they become me not he was a fool that taught them me This is the right fencing grace my lord tap for tap and so part fair

now the Lord lighten thee thou art a great fool


before God I am exceeding weary

is it come to that I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood

faith it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer
why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition

belike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face to-morrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy peach-coloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and one other for use But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of thy low-countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened

how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is

shall I tell thee one thing Poins

yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing

it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine

go to I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell

marry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad now my father is sick albeit I could tell to thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend I could be sad and sad indeed too

very hardly upon such a subject

by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end try the man But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
the reason

what wouldst thou think of me if I should weep

I would think thee a most princely hypocrite

it would be every man's thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine every man would think me a hypocrite indeed And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so

why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff

and to thee

by this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with mine own ears the worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and these two things I confess I cannot help By the mass here comes Bardolph


and the boy that I gave Falstaff a' had him from me Christian and look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape

God save your Grace


come you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be blushing wherefore blush you now What a maidenly man-at-arms are you become Is it such a matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead

a' calls me even now my lord through a red lattice and I could discern no part of his face from the window at last I spied his eyes and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's new petticoat and peeped through

hath not the boy profited

away you whoreson upright rabbit away

away you rascally Althea's dream away

instruct us boy what dream boy

marry my lord Althea dreamed she was delivered of a firebrand and therefore I call him her dream

a crown's worth of good interpretation There it is boy


O that this good blossom could be kept from cankers Well there is sixpence to preserve thee
an you do not make him be hanged among you the gallows shall have wrong

and how doth thy master Bardolph

well my lord He heard of your Grace's coming to town there's a letter for you

delivered with good respect And how doth the martlemas your master

in bodily health sir

marry the immortal part needs a physician but that moves not him though that be sick it dies not

I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds his place for look you how he writes

'John Falstaff knight every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself even like those that are akin to the king for they never prick their finger but they say There is some of the king's blood spilt How comes that says he that takes upon him not to conceive The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap I am the king's poor cousin sir

nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from Japhet But to the letter

sir John Falstaff knight to the son of the king nearest his father Harry Prince of Wales greeting Why this is a certificate
peace

I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity sure he means brevity in breath short-winded I commend me to thee I commend thee and I leave thee Be not too familiar with Poins for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell Repent at idle times as thou mayest and so farewell

my lord I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it

that's to make him eat twenty of his words But do you use me thus Ned must I marry your sister

God send the wench no worse fortune but I never said so

well thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us Is your master here in London

yes my lord

where sups he doth the old boar feed in the old frank

at the old place my lord in Eastcheap

what company
ephesians my lord of the old church

sup any women with him

none my lord but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet

what pagan may that be

a proper gentlewoman sir and a kinswoman of my master's

even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull Shall we steal upon them Ned at supper

I am your shadow my lord I'll follow you

sirrah you boy and Bardolph no word to your master that I am yet come to town there's for your silence


I have no tongue sir


fare ye well go

this Doll Tearsheet should be some road

I warrant you as common as the way between Saint Alban's and London

how might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night in his true colours and not ourselves be seen

put on two leathern jerkins and aprons and wait upon him at his table as drawers

from a god to a bull a heavy descension it was Jove's case From a prince to a prentice a low transformation that shall be mine for in every thing the purpose must weigh with the folly Follow me Ned


I pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
give even way unto my rough affairs
put not you on the visage of the times
and be like them to Percy troublesome

do what you will your wisdom be your guide

alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
and but my going nothing can redeem it

O yet for God's sake go not to these wars
the time was father that you broke your word
when you were more endear'd to it than now
when your own Percy when my heart's dear Harry
threw many a northward look to see his father
bring up his powers but he did long in vain
who then persuaded you to stay at home
there were two honours lost yours and your son's
for yours the God of heaven brighten it
for his it stuck upon him as the sun
in the grey vault of heaven and by his light
did all the chivalry of England move
to do brave acts he was indeed the glass
wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
and speaking thick which nature made his blemish
became the accents of the valiant
for those that could speak low and tardily
would turn their own perfection to abuse
to seem like him so that in speech in gait
in diet in affections of delight
in military rules humours of blood
he was the mark and glass copy and book
that fashion'd others And him O wondrous him
O miracle of men him did you leave
second to none unseconded by you
to look upon the hideous god of war
in disadvantage to abide a field
where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name
did seem defensible so you left him
never O never do his ghost the wrong
to hold your honour more precise and nice
with others than with him let them alone
the marshal and the archbishop are strong
to-day might I hanging on Hotspur's neck
have talk'd of Monmouth's grave

beshrew your heart
fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
with new lamenting ancient oversights
but I must go and meet with danger there
or it will seek me in another place
and find me worse provided

O fly to Scotland
till that the nobles and the armed commons
have of their puissance made a little taste

if they get ground and vantage of the king
then join you with them like a rib of steel
to make strength stronger but for all our loves
first let them try themselves So did your son
he was so suffer'd so came I a widow
to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
for recordation to my noble husband

come come go in with me Tis with my mind
as with the tide swell'd up unto its height
that makes a still-stand running neither way
fain would I go to meet the archbishop
but many thousand reasons hold me back
I will resolve for Scotland there am I
till time and vantage crave my company


what the devil hast thou brought there apple-johns thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john

mass thou sayst true The prince once set a dish of apple-johns before him and told him there were five more Sir Johns and putting off his hat said I will now take my leave of these six dry round old withered knights It angered him to the heart but he hath forgot that

a good shallow young fellow a' would have made a good pantler a' would have chipped bread well

they say Poins has a good wit

he a good wit hang him baboon his wit is as thick as Tewksbury mustard there is no more conceit in him than is in a mallet

why does the prince love him so then

because their legs are both of a bigness and he plays at quoits well and eats conger and fennel and drinks off candles' ends for flapdragons and rides the wild mare with the boys and jumps upon joint-stools and swears with a good grace and wears his boots very smooth like unto the sign of the leg and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories and such other gambol faculties a' has that show a weak mind and an able body for the which the prince admits him for the prince himself is such another the weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois

would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off

let's beat him before his whore

look whether the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot
is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance

blessing on your good heart and so she is by my troth

didst thou hear me

yea and you knew me as you did when you ran away by Gadshill you knew I was at your back and spoke it on purpose to try my patience

no no no not so I did not think thou wast within hearing

I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse and then I know how to handle you

see now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us Is she of the wicked Is thine hostess here of the wicked Or is thy boy of the wicked Or honest Bardolph whose zeal burns in his nose of the wicked

answer thou dead elm answer

the fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable and his face is Lucifer's privykitchen where he doth nothing but roast maltworms For the boy there is a good angel about him but the devil outbids him too

for the women

for one of them she is in hell already and burns poor souls For the other I owe her money and whether she be damned for that I know not

no I warrant you

no I think thou art not I think thou art quit for that Marry there is another indictment upon thee for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house contrary to the law for the which I think thou wilt howl
all victuallers do so what's a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent

you gentlewoman

what says your Grace

his Grace says that which his flesh rebels against


who knocks so loud at door Look to the door there Francis


Peto how now what news

the king your father is at Westminster
and there are twenty weak and wearied posts
come from the north and as I came along
I met and overtook a dozen captains
bare-headed sweating knocking at the taverns

by heaven Poins I feel me much to blame
so idly to profane the precious time
when tempest of commotion like the south
borne with black vapour doth begin to melt
and drop upon our bare unarmed heads
give me my sword and cloak Falstaff good night


now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night and we must hence and leave it unpicked

more knocking at the door

how now what's the matter

you must away to court sir presently
a dozen captains stay at door for you

pay the musicians sirrah Farewell hostess farewell Doll You see my good wenches how men of merit are sought after the undeserver may sleep when the man of action is called on Farewell good wenches If I be not sent away post I will see you again ere I go
I cannot speak if my heart be not ready to burst well sweet Jack have a care of thyself

farewell farewell


well fare thee well I have known thee these twenty-nine years come peascod-time but an honester and truer-hearted man well fare thee well

mistress Tearsheet

what's the matter

bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master

O run Doll run run good Doll

go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick
but ere they come bid them o'er-read these letters
and well consider of them Make good speed

are at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep
nature's soft nurse how have I frighted thee
that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
and steep my senses in forgetfulness
why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
and hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber
than in the perfum'd chambers of the great
under the canopies of costly state
and lull'd with sound of sweetest melody
O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
in loathsome beds and leav'st the kingly couch
a watch-case or a common larum bell
wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
seel up the ship-boy's eyes and rock his brains
in cradle of the rude imperious surge
and in the visitation of the winds
who take the ruffian billows by the top
curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
that with the hurly death itself awakes
canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose
to the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude
and in the calmest and most stillest night
with all appliances and means to boot
deny it to a king Then happy low lie down
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown


many good morrows to your majesty

is it good morrow lords

'Tis one o'clock and past

why then good morrow to you all my lords
have you read o'er the letters that I sent you

we have my liege
then you perceive the body of our kingdom
how foul it is what rank diseases grow
and with what danger near the heart of it

it is but as a body yet distemper'd
which to his former strength may be restor'd
with good advice and little medicine
my Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd

O God that one might read the book of fate
and see the revolution of the times
make mountains level and the continent
weary of solid firmness melt itself
into the sea and other times to see
the beachy girdle of the ocean
too wide for Neptune's hips how chances mock
and changes fill the cup of alteration
with divers liquors O if this were seen
the happiest youth viewing his progress through
would shut the book and sit him down and die
'Tis not ten years gone
since Richard and Northumberland great friends
did feast together and in two years after
were they at wars it is but eight years since
this Percy was the man nearest my soul
who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
and laid his love and life under my foot
yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard
gave him defiance But which of you was by


you cousin Nevil as I may remember
when Richard with his eye brimful of tears
then check'd and rated by Northumberland
did speak these words now prov'd a prophecy
'Northumberland thou ladder by the which
my cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne
though then God knows I had no such intent
that I and greatness were compelled to kiss
'The time shall come thus did he follow it
'The time will come that foul sin gathering head
shall break into corruption so went on
foretelling this same time's condition
and the division of our amity

there is a history in all men's lives
figuring the nature of the times deceas'd
the which observ'd a man may prophesy
with a near aim of the main chance of things
as yet not come to life which in their seeds
and weak leginnings lie intreasured
such things become the hatch and brood of time
and by the necessary form of this
king Richard might create a perfect guess
that great Northumberland then false to him
would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
which should not find a ground to root upon

are these things then necessities
then let us meet them like necessities
and that same word even now cries out on us
they say the bishop and Northumberland
are fifty thousand strong

it cannot be my lord
rumour doth double like the voice and echo
the numbers of the fear'd Please it your Grace
to go to bed upon my soul my lord
the powers that you already have sent forth
shall bring this prize in very easily
to comfort you the more I have receiv'd
a certain instance that Glendower is dead
your majesty hath been this fortnight ill
and these unseason'd hours perforce must add
unto your sickness

and were these inward wars once out of hand
we would dear lords unto the Holy Land


come on come on come on sir give me your hand sir give me your hand sir an early stirrer by the rood And how doth my good cousin Silence

good morrow good cousin Shallow

this Sir John cousin that comes hither anon about soldiers

the same Sir John the very same I saw him break Skogan's head at the court gate when a' was a crack not thus high and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish a fruiterer behind Gray's Inn Jesu Jesu the mad days that I have spent and to see how many of mine old acquaintance are dead

we shall all follow cousin

certain tis certain very sure very sure death as the Psalmist saith is certain to all all shall die How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair

truly cousin I was not there

death is certain Is old Double of your town living yet

dead sir

Jesu Jesu dead a' drew a good bow and dead a' shot a fine shoot John a Gaunt loved him well and betted much money on his head Dead a' would have clapped i' the clout at twelve score and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half that it would have done a man's heart good to see How a score of ewes now

'Fore God I would you would Master Shallow

go to I have spoke at a word God keep you

fare you well gentle gentlemen
as I return I will fetch off these justices I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow Lord Lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's tribute I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring when a' was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife a' was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a' was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake a' came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the over-scutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and I'll be sworn a' never saw him but once in the Tilt-yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs Well I will be acquainted with him if I return and it shall go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two stones to me If the young dace be a bait for the old pike I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him Let time shape and there an end

what is this forest call'd

'Tis Gaultree Forest an't shall please your Grace

here stand my lords and send discovers forth
to know the numbers of our enemies

we have sent forth already

'Tis well done
my friends and brethren in these great affairs
I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd
new-dated letters from Northumberland
their cold intent tenour and substance thus
here doth he wish his person with such powers
as might hold sortance with his quality
the which he could not levy whereupon
to Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
that your attempts may overlive the hazard
and fearful meeting of their opposite

thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
and dash themselves to pieces


now what news

west of this forest scarcely off a mile
in goodly form comes on the enemy
and by the ground they hide I judge their number
upon or near the rate of thirty thousand

the just proportion that we gave them out
let us sway on and face them in the field



I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland

health and fair greeting from our general
the Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster

say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace
what doth concern your coming

then my lord
unto your Grace do I in chief address
the substance of my speech If that rebellion
came like itself in base and abject routs
led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
and countenanc'd by boys and beggary
I say if damn'd commotion so appear'd
in his true native and most proper shape
you reverend father and these noble lords
had not been here to dress the ugly form
with your fair honours You lord archbishop
whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd
whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd
whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd
whose white investments figure innocence
the dove and very blessed spirit of peace
wherefore do you so ill translate yourself
out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war
turning your books to greaves your ink to blood
your pens to lances and your tongue divine
to a loud trumpet and a point of war

wherefore do I this so the question stands
briefly to this end we are all diseas'd
and with our surfeiting and wanton hours
have brought ourselves into a burning fever
and we must bleed for it of which disease
our late king Richard being infected died
I take not on me here as a physician
nor do I as an enemy to peace
troop in the throngs of military men
but rather show a while like fearful war
to diet rank minds sick of happiness
and purge the obstructions which begin to stop
our very veins of life Hear me more plainly
I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
and find our griefs heavier than our offences
we see which way the stream of time doth run
and are enforc'd from our most quiet sphere
by the rough torrent of occasion
and have the summary of all our griefs
when time shall serve to show in articles
which long ere this we offer'd to the king
and might by no suit gain our audience
when we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs
we are denied access unto his person
the dangers of the days but newly gone
whose memory is written on the earth
with yet appearing blood and the examples
of every minute's instance present now
have put us in these ill-beseeming arms
not to break peace or any branch of it
but to establish here a peace indeed
concurring both in name and quality

when ever yet was your appeal denied
wherein have you been galled by the king
what peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you
that you should seal this lawless bloody book
of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine
and consecrate commotion's bitter edge

my brother general the commonwealth
to brother born an household cruelty
I make my quarrel in particular
there is no need of any such redress
or if there were it not belongs to you

why not to him in part and to us all
that feel the bruises of the days before
and suffer the condition of these times
to lay a heavy and unequal hand
upon our honours

O my good Lord Mowbray
construe the times to their necessities
and you shall say indeed it is the time
and not the king that doth you injuries
yet for your part it not appears to me
either from the king or in the present time
that you should have an inch of any ground
to build a grief on were you not restor'd
to all the Duke of Norfolk's signories
your noble and right well-remember'd father's
what thing in honour had my father lost
that need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me
the king that lov'd him as the state stood then
was force perforce compell'd to banish him
and then that Harry Bolingbroke and he
being mounted and both roused in their seats
their neighing coursers daring of the spur
their armed staves in charge their beavers down
their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel
and the loud trumpet blowing them together
then then when there was nothing could have stay'd
my father from the breast of Bolingbroke
O when the king did throw his warder down
his own life hung upon the staff he threw
then threw he down himself and all their lives
that by indictment and by dint of sword
have since miscarried under Bolingbroke

you speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what
in England the most valiant gentleman
who knows on whom Fortune would then have smil'd
but if your father had been victor there
he ne'er had borne it out of Coventry
for all the country in a general voice
cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
were set on Hereford whom they doted on
and bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the king
but this is mere digression from my purpose
here come I from our princely general
to know your griefs to tell you from his Grace
that he will give you audience and wherein
it shall appear that your demands are just
you shall enjoy them every thing set off
that might so much as think you enemies

but he hath forc'd us to compel this offer
and it proceeds from policy not love

this offer comes from mercy not from fear
for lo within a ken our army lies
upon mine honour all too confident
to give admittance to a thought of fear
our battle is more full of names than yours
our men more perfect in the use of arms
our armour all as strong our cause the best
then reason will our hearts should be as good
say you not then our offer is compell'd

well by my will we shall admit no parley

that argues but the shame of your offence
a rotten case abides no handling

hath the Prince John a full commission
in very ample virtue of his father
to hear and absolutely to determine
of what conditions we shall stand upon
that is intended in the general's name
I muse you make so slight a question

then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule
for this contains our general grievances
each several article herein redress'd
all members of our cause both here and hence
that are insinew'd to this action
acquitted by a true substantial form
and present execution of our wills
to us and to our purposes consign'd
we come within our awful banks again
and knit our powers to the arm of peace

this will I show the general Please you lords
in sight of both our battles we may meet
and either end in peace which God so frame
or to the place of difference call the swords
which must decide it
my lord we will do so


there is a thing within my bosom tells me
that no conditions of our peace can stand

fear you not that if we can make our peace
upon such large terms and so absolute
as our condition shall consist upon
our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains

yea but our valuation shall be such
that every slight and false-derived cause
yea every idle nice and wanton reason
shall to the king taste of this action
that were our royal faiths martyrs in love
we shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
and good from bad find no partition
no no my lord Note this the king is weary
of dainty and such picking grievances
for he hath found to end one doubt by death
revives two greater in the heirs of life
and therefore will he wipe his tables clean
and keep no tell-tale to his memory
that may repeat and history his loss
to new remembrance for full well he knows
he cannot so precisely weed this land
as his misdoubts present occasion
his foes are so enrooted with his friends
that plucking to unfix an enemy
he doth unfasten so and shake a friend
so that this land like an offensive wife
that hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes
as he is striking holds his infant up
and hangs resolv'd correction in the arm
that was uprear'd to execution

on late offenders that he now doth lack
the very instruments of chastisement
so that his power like to a fangless lion
may offer but not hold

'Tis very true
and therefore be assur'd my good lord marshal
if we do now make our atonement well
our peace will like a broken limb united
grow stronger for the breaking

be it so
here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland


the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship
to meet his Grace just distance tween our armies

your Grace of York in God's name then set forward
before and greet his Grace my lord we come

you are well encounter'd here my cousin Mowbray
good day to you gentle lord archbishop
and so to you Lord Hastings and to all
my Lord of York it better show'd with you
when that your flock assembled by the bell
encircled you to hear with reverence
your exposition on the holy text
than now to see you here an iron man
cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
turning the word to sword and life to death
that man that sits within a monarch's heart
and ripens in the sunshine of his favour
would he abuse the countenance of the king
alack what mischief might he set abroach
in shadow of such greatness With you lord bishop
it is even so Who hath not heard it spoken
how deep you were within the books of God
to us the imagin'd voice of God himself
the very opener and intelligencer
between the grace the sanctities of heaven
and our dull workings O who shall believe
but you misuse the reverence of your place
employ the countenance and grace of heaven
as a false favourite doth his prince's name
in deeds dishonourable You have taken up
under the counterfeited zeal of God
the subjects of his substitute my father
and both against the peace of heaven and him
have here upswarm'd them

good my Lord of Lancaster
I am not here against your father's peace
but as I told my Lord of Westmoreland
the time misorder'd doth in common sense
crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
to hold our safety up I sent your Grace
the which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court
whereon this Hydra son of war is born
whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
with grant of our most just and right desires
and true obedience of this madness cur'd
stoop tamely to the foot of majesty

if not we ready are to try our fortunes
to the last man

and though we here fall down
we have supplies to second our attempt
if they miscarry theirs shall second them
and so success of mischief shall be born
and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
whiles England shall have generation

you are too shallow Hastings much too shallow
to sound the bottom of the after-times
pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
how far forth you do like their articles

I like them all and do allow them well
and swear here by the honour of my blood
my father's purposes have been mistook
and some about him have too lavishly
wrested his meaning and authority
my lord these griefs shall be with speed redress'd
upon my soul they shall If this may please you
discharge your powers unto their several counties
as we will ours and here between the armies
let's drink together friendly and embrace
that all their eyes may bear those tokens home
of our restored love and amity

I take your princely word for these redresses

I give it you and will maintain my word

go captain and deliver to the army
this news of peace let them have pay and part
I know it will well please them hie thee captain


to you my noble Lord of Westmoreland

I pledge your Grace and if you knew what pains
I have bestow'd to breed this present peace
you would drink freely but my love to you
shall show itself more openly hereafter

I do not doubt you

I am glad of it
health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray

you wish me health in very happy season

against ill chances men are ever merry
but heaviness foreruns the good event

therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
serves to say thus Some good thing comes to morrow

believe me I am passing light in spirit

so much the worse if your own rule be true


the word of peace is render'd hark how they shout

this had been cheerful after victory

a peace is of the nature of a conquest
for then both parties nobly are subdu'd
and neither party loser
go my lord
and let our army be discharged too

and good my lord so please you let our trains
march by us that we may peruse the men
we should have cop'd withal

go good Lord Hastings
and ere they be dismiss'd let them march by


I trust lords we shall lie to-night together

now cousin wherefore stands our army still

the leaders having charge from you to stand
will not go off until they hear you speak

they know their duties

my lord our army is dispers'd already
like youthful steers unyok'd they take their courses
east west north south or like a school broke up
each hurries toward his home and sporting-place

good tidings my Lord Hastings for the which
I do arrest thee traitor of high treason
and you lord archbishop and you Lord Mowbray
of capital treason I attach you both

is this proceeding just and honourable

is your assembly so

will you thus break your faith

I pawn'd thee none
I promis'd you redress of these same grievances
I will perform with a most Christian care
but for you rebels look to taste the due
meet for rebellion and such acts as yours
most shallowly did you these arms commence
fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
strike up our drums pursue the scatter'd stray
God and not we hath safely fought to-day
some guard these traitors to the block of death
treason's true bed and yielder up of breath


what's your name sir of what condition are you and of what place I pray

I am a knight sir and my name is Colevile of the dale

well then Colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale Colevile shall still be your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still Colevile of the dale

are not you Sir John Falstaff


I think you are Sir John Falstaff and in that thought yield me

I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name An I had but a belly of any indifferency I were simply the most active fellow in Europe my womb my womb my womb undoes me Here comes our general


the heat is past follow no further now
call in the powers good cousin Westmoreland

now Falstaff where have you been all this while
when everything is ended then you come
these tardy tricks of yours will on my life
one time or other break some gallows' back

I would be sorry my lord but it should be thus I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour Do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet have I in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility I have foundered nine score and odd posts and here travel-tainted as I am have in my pure and immaculate valour taken Sir John Colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy But what of that he saw me and yielded that I may justly say with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome I came saw and overcame

it was more of his courtesy than your deserving

I know not here he is and here I yield him and I beseech your Grace let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds or by the Lord I will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top on't Colevile kissing my foot To the which course if I be enforced if you do not all show like gilt two-pences to me and I in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins' heads to her believe not the word of the noble Therefore let me have right and let desert mount
thine's too heavy to mount

let it shine then

thine's too thick to shine

let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will

is thy name Colevile

it is my lord

a famous rebel art thou Colevile

and a famous true subject took him

I am my lord but as my betters are
that led me hither had they been rul'd by me
you should have won them dearer than you have
I know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and I thank thee for thee


have you left pursuit

retreat is made and execution stay'd

send Colevile with his confederates
to York to present execution
blunt lead him hence and see you guard him sure

and now dispatch we toward the court my lords
I hear the king my father is sore sick
our news shall go before us to his majesty
which cousin

, you shall bear to comfort him
and we with sober speed will follow you

through Gloucestershire and when you come to court
stand my good lord pray in your good report

fare you well Falstaff I in my condition
shall better speak of you than you deserve


I would you had but the wit twere better than your dukedom Good faith this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood and making many fish-meals that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness and then when they marry they get wenches They are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which deliver'd o'er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme It illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a-work and leaining a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a thousand sons the first human principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack

how now Bardolph

the army is discharged all and gone

let them go I'll through Gloucestershire and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow esquire I have him already tempering between my finger and my thumb and shortly will I seal with him Come away


now lords if God doth give successful end
to this debate that bleedeth at our doors
we will our youth lead on to higher fields
our navy is address'd our power collected
our substitutes in absence well invested
and everything lies level to our wish
only we want a little personal strength
and pause us till these rebels now afoot
come underneath the yoke of government

both which we doubt not but your majesty
shall soon enjoy

Humphrey my son of Gloucester
where is the prince your brother

I think he's gone to hunt my lord at Windsor

and how accompanied

I do not know my lord


no my good lord he is in presence here

what would my lord and father

nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence
how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother
he loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas
thou hast a better place in his affection
than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
and noble offices thou mayst effect
of mediation after I am dead
between his greatness and thy other brethren
therefore omit him not blunt not his love
nor lose the good advantage of his grace
by seeming cold or careless of his will
for he is gracious if he be observ'd
he hath a tear for pity and a hand
open as day for melting charity
as humorous as winter and as sudden
as flaws congealed in the spring of day
his temper therefore must be well observ'd
chide him for faults and do it reverently
when you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth
but being moody give him line and scope
till that his passions like a whale on ground
confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas
and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
that the united vessel of their blood
mingled with venom of suggestion
as force perforce the age will pour it in
shall never leak though it do work as strong
as aconitum or rash gunpowder

I shall observe him with all care and love

why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas
he is not there to-day he dines in London

and how accompanied canst thou tell that

with Poins and other his continual followers

most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
and he the noble image of my youth
is overspread with them therefore my grief
stretches itself beyond the hour of death
the blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
in forms imaginary the unguided days
and rotten times that you shall look upon
when I am sleeping with my ancestors
for when his headstrong riot hath no curb
when rage and hot blood are his counsellors
when means and lavish manners meet together
O with what wings shall his affections fly
towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay
my gracious lord you look beyond him quite
the prince but studies his companions
like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
'Tis needful that the most immodest word
be look'd upon and learn'd which once attain'd
your highness knows comes to no further use
but to be known and hated So like gross terms
the prince will in the perfectness of time
cast off his followers and their memory
shall as a pattern or a measure live
by which his Grace must mete the lives of others
turning past evils to advantages

'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
in the dead carrion

who's here Westmoreland

health to my sovereign and new happiness
prince John your son doth kiss your Grace's hand
Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all
are brought to the correction of your law
there is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd
but Peace puts forth her olive everywhere
the manner how this action hath been borne
here at more leisure may your highness read
with every course in his particular

O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird
which ever in the haunch of winter sings
the lifting up of day

look here's more news

from enemies heaven keep your majesty
and when they stand against you may they fall
as those that I am come to tell you of
the Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph
are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown
the manner and true order of the fight
this packet please it you contains at large

and wherefore should these good news make me sick
will Fortune never come with both hands full
but write her fair words still in foulest letters
she either gives a stomach and no food
such are the poor in health or else a feast
and takes away the stomach such are the rich
that have abundance and enjoy it not
I should rejoice now at this happy news
and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
O me come near me now I am much ill

comfort your majesty

O my royal father


be patient princes you do know these fits
are with his highness very ordinary
stand from him give him air he'll straight be well

no no he cannot long hold out these pangs
the incessant care and labour of his mind
hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
so thin that life looks through and will break out

the people fear me for they do observe
unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature
the seasons change their manners as the year
had found some months asleep and leap'd them over

the river hath thrice flow'd no ebb between
and the old folk time's doting chronicles
say it did so a little time before
that our great-grandsire Edward sick'd and died
speak lower princes for the king recovers

this apoplexy will certain be his end

I pray you take me up and bear me hence
into some other chamber softly pray

let there be no noise made my gentle friends
unless some dull and favourable hand
will whisper music to my weary spirit

call for the music in the other room

set me the crown upon my pillow here

his eye is hollow and he changes much

less noise less noise

who saw the Duke of Clarence

I am here brother full of heaviness

how now rain within doors and none abroad
how doth the king

exceeding ill

heard he the good news yet
tell it him

he alter'd much upon the hearing it

if he be sick with joy he will recover without physic

not so much noise my lords Sweet prince speak low
the king your father is dispos'd to sleep


will't please your Grace to go along with us

no I will sit and watch here by the king

why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
being so troublesome a bedfellow
O polish'd perturbation golden care
that keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
to many a watchful night Sleep with it now
yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
as he whose brow with homely biggin bound
snores out the watch of night O majesty
when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
like a rich armour worn in heat of day
that scalds with safety By his gates of breath
there lies a downy feather which stirs not
did he suspire that light and weightless down
perforce must move My gracious lord my father
that from this golden rigol hath divorc'd
so many English kings Thy due from me
is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
which nature love and filial tenderness
shall O dear father pay thee plenteously
my due from thee is this imperial crown
which as immediate from thy place and blood
derives itself to me Lo here it sits

which heaven shall guard and put the world's whole strength
into one giant arm it shall not force
this lineal honour from me This from thee
will I to mine leave as tis left to me


Warwick Gloucester Clarence


doth the king call
what would your majesty How fares your Grace

why did you leave me here alone my lords

we left the prince my brother here my liege
who undertook to sit and watch by you

the Prince of Wales Where is he let me see him
he is not here

this door is open he is gone this way

he came not through the chamber where we stay'd

where is the crown who took it from my pillow

when we withdrew my liege we left it here

the prince hath ta'en it hence go seek him out
my sleep my death
find him my Lord of Warwick chide him hither

this part of his conjoins with my disease
and helps to end me See sons what things you are
how quickly nature falls into revolt
when gold becomes her object
for this the foolish over-careful fathers
have broke their sleeps with thoughts
their brains with care their bones with industry
for this they have engrossed and pil'd up
the canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold
for this they have been thoughtful to invest
their sons with arts and martial exercises
when like the bee culling from every flower
the virtuous sweets
our thighs packed with wax our mouths with honey
we bring it to the hive and like the bees
are murder'd for our pains This bitter taste


now where is he that will not stay so long

till his friend sickness hath determin'd me

my lord I found the prince in the next room
washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
with such a deep demeanour in great sorrow
that tyranny which never quaff'd but blood
would by beholding him have wash'd his knife
with gentle eye-drops He is coming hither

but wherefore did he take away the crown


lo where he comes Come hither to me Harry
depart the chamber leave us here alone


thy wish was father Harry to that thought
I stay too long by thee I weary thee
dost thou so hunger for my empty chair
that thou wilt needs invest thee with mine honours
before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth
thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee
stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
is held from falling with so weak a wind
that it will quickly drop my day is dim
thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours
were thine without offence and at my death
thou hast seal'd up my expectation
thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not
and thou wilt have me die assur'd of it
thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
to stab at half an hour of my life
what canst thou not forbear me half an hour
and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
that thou art crowned not that I am dead
let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
only compound me with forgotten dust
give that which gave thee life unto the worms
pluck down my officers break my decrees
for now a time is come to mock at form
Harry the Fifth is crown'd Up vanity
down royal state all you sage counsellors hence
and to the English court assemble now
from every region apes of idleness
now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
revel the night rob murder and commit
the oldest sins the newest kind of ways
be happy he will trouble you no more
England shall double gild his treble guilt
England shall give him office honour might
the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
shall flesh his tooth in every innocent
O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
when that my care could not withhold thy riots
what wilt thou do when riot is thy care
O thou wilt be a wilderness again
peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants

O pardon me my liege but for my tears
the moist impediments unto my speech
I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
the course of it so far There is your crown
and he that wears the crown immortally
long guard it yours If I affect it more
than as your honour and as your renown
let me no more from this obedience rise
which my most true and inward duteous spirit
teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
and found no course of breath within your majesty
how cold it struck my heart if I do feign
O let me in my present wildness die
and never live to show the incredulous world
the noble change that I have purposed
coming to look on you thinking you dead
and dead almost my liege to think you were
I spake unto the crown as having sense
and thus upbraided it The care on thee depending
hath fed upon the body of my father
therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
other less fine in carat is more precious
preserving life in medicine potable
but thou most fine most honour'd most renown'd
hast eat thy bearer up Thus my most royal liege
accusing it I put it on my head
to try with it as with an enemy
that had before my face murder'd my father
the quarrel of a true inheritor
or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
did with the least affection of a welcome
give entertainment to the might of it
let God for ever keep it from my head
and make me as the poorest vassal is
that doth with awe and terror kneel to it

O my son
God put it in thy mind to take it hence
that thou mightst win the more thy father's love
pleading so wisely in excuse of it
come hither Harry sit thou by my bed
and hear I think the very latest counsel
that ever I shall breathe God knows my son
by what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
I met this crown and I myself know well
how troublesome it sat upon my head
to thee it shall descend with better quiet
for all the soil of the achievement goes
with me into the earth It seem'd in me
but as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand
and I had many living to upbraid
my gain of it by their assistances
which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
wounding supposed peace All these bold fears
thou seest with peril I have answered
for all my reign hath been but as a scene
acting that argument and now my death
changes the mode for what in me was purchas'd
falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
so thou the garment wear'st successively
yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do
thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
and all my friends which thou must make thy friends
have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out
by whose fell working I was first advanc'd
and by whose power I well might lodge a fear
I cut them off and had a purpose now
to lead out many to the Holy Land
lest rest and lying still might make them look
too near unto my state Therefore my Harry
be it thy course to busy giddy minds
with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
may waste the memory of the former days
more would I but my lungs are wasted so
that strength of speech is utterly denied me
how I came by the crown O God forgive
and grant it may with thee in true peace live

my gracious liege
you won it wore it kept it gave it me
then plain and right must my possession be
which I with more than with a common pain
'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain



health peace and happiness to my royal father

thou bring'st me happiness and peace son John
but health alack with youthful wings is flown
from this bare wither'd trunk upon thy sight
my worldly business makes a period
where is my Lord of Warwick

my Lord of Warwick


doth any name particular belong
unto the lodging where I first did swound

'Tis call'd Jerusalem my noble lord

laud be to God even there my life must end
it hath been prophesied to me many years
which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land
but bear me to that chamber there I'll lie
in that Jerusalem shall Harry die

by cock and pie sir you shall not away to-night What Davy I say

you must excuse me Master Robert Shallow

I will not excuse you you shall not be excused excuses shall not be admitted there is no excuse shall serve you shall not be excused Why Davy


here sir

Davy Davy Davy Davy let me see Davy let me see yea marry William cook bid him come hither Sir John you shall not be excused

marry sir thus those precepts cannot be served and again sir shall we sow the headland with wheat

with red wheat Davy But for William cook are there no young pigeons


let it be cast and paid Sir John you shall not be excused

now sir a new link to the bucket must needs be had and sir do you mean to stop any of William's wages about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley fair

a' shall answer it Some pigeons Davy a couple of short-legged hens a joint of mutton and any pretty little tiny kickshaws tell William cook

doth the man of war stay all night sir

yea Davy I will use him well A friend i' the court is better than a penny in purse Use his men well Davy for they are arrant knaves and will backbite

no worse than they are back-bitten sir for they have marvellous foul linen

well conceited Davy about thy business Davy

I beseech you sir to countenance William Visor of Wincot against Clement Perkes of the hill

there are many complaints Davy against that Visor that Visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge


go to I say he shall have no wrong Look about Davy

where are you Sir John Come come come off with your boots Give me your hand Master Bardolph

I am glad to see your worship

I thank thee with all my heart kind Master Bardolph

and welcome my tall fellow Come Sir John

I'll follow you good Master Robert Shallow

if I were sawed into quantities I should make four dozen of such bearded hermit's staves as Master Shallow It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his they by observing him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justice-like serving-man Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild-geese If I had a suit to Master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and a' shall laugh without intervallums O it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up

sir John

I come Master Shallow I come Master Shallow

how now my Lord Chief Justice whither away

how doth the king

exceeding well his cares are now all ended

I hope not dead

he's walk'd the way of nature
and to our purposes he lives no more

I would his majesty had call'd me with him
the service that I truly did his life
hath left me open to all injuries

indeed I think the young king loves you not

I know he doth not and do arm myself
to welcome the condition of the time
than I have drawn it in my fantasy


here come the heavy issue of dead Harry
O that the living Harry had the temper
of him the worst of these three gentlemen
how many nobles then should hold their places
that must strike sail to spirits of vile sort

O God I fear all will be overturn'd

good morrow cousin Warwick good morrow

good morrow cousin

good morrow cousin

we meet like men that had forgot to speak

is all too heavy to admit much talk

well peace be with him that hath made us heavy

peace be with us lest we be heavier

O good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
and I dare swear you borrow not that face
of seeming sorrow it is sure your own

though no man be assur'd what grace to find
you stand in coldest expectation
I am the sorrier would twere otherwise

well you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair
which swims against your stream of quality

sweet princes what I did I did in honour
led by the impartial conduct of my soul
a ragged and forestall'd remission
if truth and upright innocency fail me
I'll to the king my master that is dead
and tell him who hath sent me after him

here comes the prince


good morrow and God save your majesty

this new and gorgeous garment majesty
sits not so easy on me as you think
brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
this is the English not the Turkish court
not Amurath an Amurath succeeds
but Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers
for to speak truth it very well becomes you
sorrow so royally in you appears
that I will deeply put the fashion on
but entertain no more of it good brothers
than a joint burden laid upon us all
for me by heaven I bid you be assur'd
I'll be your father and your brother too
let me but bear your love I'll bear your cares
yet weep that Harry's dead and so will I
but Harry lives that shall convert those tears
by number into hours of happiness

we hope no other from your majesty

you all look strangely on me

and you most
you are I think assur'd I love you not

I am assur'd if I be measur'd rightly
your majesty hath no just cause to hate me

how might a prince of my great hopes forget
so great indignities you laid upon me
what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
the immediate heir of England Was this easy
may this be wash'd in Lethe and forgotten

I then did use the person of your father
the image of his power lay then in me
and in the administration of his law
whiles I was busy for the commonwealth
your highness pleased to forget my place
the majesty and power of law and justice
the image of the king whom I presented
and struck me in my very seat of judgment
whereon as an offender to your father
I gave bold way to my authority
and did commit you If the deed were ill
be you contented wearing now the garland
to have a son set your decrees at nought
to trip the course of law and blunt the sword
that guards the peace and safety of your person
nay more to spurn at your most royal image
and mock your workings in a second body
question your royal thoughts make the case yours
be now the father and propose a son
hear your own dignity so much profan'd
see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
behold yourself so by a son disdain'd
and then imagine me taking your part
and in your power soft silencing your son
after this cold considerance sentence me
and as you are a king speak in your state
what I have done that misbecame my place
my person or my liege's sov'reignty

you are right justice and you weigh this well
therefore still bear the balance and the sword
and I do wish your honours may increase
offend you and obey you as I did
so shall I live to speak my father's words
'Happy am I that have a man so bold
that dares do justice on my proper son
and not less happy having such a son
that would deliver up his greatness so
into the hands of justice You did commit me
for which I do commit into your hand
the unstained sword that you have us'd to bear
with this remembrance that you use the same
with the like bold just and impartial spirit
as you have done gainst me There is my hand
you shall be as a father to my youth
my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
and I will stoop and humble my intents
to your well-practis'd wise directions
and princes all believe me I beseech you
my father is gone wild into his grave
for in his tomb lie my affections
to mock the expectation of the world
to frustrate prophecies and to raze out
rotten opinion who hath writ me down
after my seeming The tide of blood in me
hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now
now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
where it shall mingle with the state of floods
and flow henceforth in formal majesty
now call we our high court of parliament
and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
that the great body of our state may go
in equal rank with the best govern'd nation
that war or peace or both at once may be
as things acquainted and familiar to us
in which you father shall have foremost hand
our coronation done we will accite
as I before remember'd all our state
and God consigning to my good intents
no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say


nay you shall see mine orchard where in an arbour we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing with a dish of caraways and so forth come cousin Silence and then to bed

'Fore God you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich

barren barren barren beggars all beggars all Sir John marry good air Spread Davy spread Davy well said Davy

Ah sirrah quoth a' we shall

I hope to see London once ere I die

and golden times and happy news of price

I speak of Africa and golden joys

O base Assyrian knight what is thy news

and Robin Hood Scarlet and John

why here it is welcome these pleasant days

the constables have delivered her over to me and she shall have whipping-cheer enough I warrant her there hath been a man or two lately killed about her

nut-hook nut-hook you lie Come on I'll tell thee what thou damned tripe-visaged rascal an the child I now go with do miscarry thou hadst better thou hadst struck thy mother thou paper-faced villain

O the Lord that Sir John were come he would make this a bloody day to somebody But I pray God the fruit of her womb miscarry

if it do you shall have a dozen of cushions again you have but eleven now Come I charge you both go with me for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat among you

I'll tell thee what thou thin man in a censer I will have you as soundly swinged for this you blue-bottle rogue you filthy famished correctioner if you be not swinged I'll forswear half-kirtles

the trumpets have sounded twice

stand here by me Master Robert Shallow I will make the king do you grace I will leer upon him as a' comes by and do but mark the countenance that he will give me

God bless thy lungs good knight


it doth so

it shows my earnestness of affection

it doth so

my devotion

it doth it doth it doth

as it were to ride day and night and not to deliberate not to remember not to have patience to shift me

it is most certain

but to stand stained with travel and sweating with desire to see him thinking of nothing else putting all affairs else in oblivion as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him

'Tis semper idem for absque hoc nihil est
'Tis all in every part
'Tis so indeed

my knight I will inflame thy noble liver
and make thee rage
thy Doll and Helen of thy noble thoughts
is in base durance and contagious prison
hal'd thither
by most mechanical and dirty hand
rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto's snake
for Doll is in Pistol speaks nought but truth

I will deliver her


there roar'd the sea and trumpetclangor sounds


God save thy grace King Hal my royal Hal


God save thee my sweet boy

my lord chief justice speak to that vain man

have you your wits know you what tis you speak

my king my Jove I speak to thee my heart

I know thee not old man fall to thy prayers
how ill white hairs become a fool and jester
I have long dream'd of such a kind of man
so surfeit-swell'd so old and so profane
but being awak'd I do despise my dream
make less thy body hence and more thy grace
leave gormandising know the grave doth gape
for thee thrice wider than for other men
reply not to me with a fool-born jest
presume not that I am the thing I was
that I have turn'd away my former self
so will I those that kept me company
when thou dost hear I am as I have been
approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast
the tutor and the feeder of my riots
till then I banish thee on pain of death
as I have done the rest of my misleaders
not to come near our person by ten mile
for competence of life I will allow you
that lack of means enforce you not to evil
and as we hear you do reform yourselves
we will according to your strength and qualities
give you advancement Be it your charge my lord
to see perform'd the tenour of our word
set on


master Shallow I owe you a thousand pound


that can hardly be Master Shallow Do not you grieve at this I shall be sent for in private to him Look you he must seem thus to the world Fear not your advancements I will be the man yet that shall make you great

I cannot perceive how unless you should give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw I beseech you good Sir John let me have five hundred of my thousand

sir I will be as good as my word this that you heard was but a colour

a colour that I fear you will die in Sir John

fear no colours go with me to dinner Come Lieutenant Pistol come Bardolph I shall be sent for soon at night


go carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet
take all his company along with him

my lord my lord

I cannot now speak I will hear you soon
take them away
si fortuna me tormenta spero contenta


I like this fair proceeding of the king's
he hath intent his wonted followers
shall all be very well provided for
but all are banish'd till their conversations
appear more wise and modest to the world

and so they are

the king hath call'd his parliament my lord

he hath

I will lay odds that ere this year expire
we bear our civil swords and native fire
as far as France I heard a bird so sing
whose music to my thinking pleas'd the king


first my fear then my curtsy last my speech My fear is your displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech to beg your pardon If you look for a good speech now you undo me for what I have to say is of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I doubt prove mine own marring But to the purpose and so to the venture Be it known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better I did mean indeed to pay you with this which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle creditors lose Here I promised you I would be and here I commit my body to your mercies bate me some and I will pay you some and as most debtors do promise you infinitely
if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to use my legs and yet that were but light payment to dance out of your debt But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction and so will I All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assembly
one word more I beseech you If you be not too much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will continue the story with Sir John in it and make you merry with fair Katharine of France where for anything I know Falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already a' be killed with your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr and this is not the man My tongue is weary when my legs are too I will bid you good night and so kneel down before you but indeed to pray for the queen

THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY VI


as by your high imperial majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France
as procurator to your excellence
to marry Princess Margaret for your Grace
so in the famous ancient city Tours
in presence of the Kings of France and Sicil
the Dukes of Orleans Calaber Britaine and Alen on
seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops
I have perform'd my task and was espous'd
and humbly now upon my bended knee
deliver up my title in the queen
to your most gracious hands that are the substance
of that great shadow I did represent
the happiest gift that ever marquess gave
the fairest queen that ever king receiv'd

Suffolk arise Welcome Queen Margaret
I can express no kinder sign of love
than this kind kiss O Lord that lends me life
lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
for thou hast given me in this beauteous face
a world of earthly blessings to my soul
if sympathy of love unite our thoughts

great King of England and my gracious lord
the mutual conference that my mind hath had
by day by night waking and in my dreams
in courtly company or at my beads
with you mine alderliefest sovereign
with ruder terms such as my wit affords
and over-joy of heart doth minister

her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty
makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys
such is the fulness of my heart's content
lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love

long live Queen Margaret England's happiness

we thank you all


my Lord Protector so it please your Grace
here are the articles of contracted peace
between our sovereign and the French King Charles
for eighteen months concluded by consent

Item That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father


uncle how now

pardon me gracious lord
some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
and dimm'd mine eyes that I can read no further

uncle of Winchester I pray read on

Item It is further agreed between them that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father and she sent over of the King of England's own proper cost and charges without having any dowry

they please us well Lord marquess kneel down
we here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk
and girt thee with the sword Cousin of York
we here discharge your Grace from being regent
i' the parts of France till term of eighteen months
be full expir'd Thanks uncle Winchester
Salisbury and Warwick
we thank you all for this great favour done
in entertainment to my princely queen
come let us in and with all speed provide
to see her coronation be perform'd


brave peers of England pillars of the state
to you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief
your grief the common grief of all the land
what did my brother Henry spend his youth
his valour coin and people in the wars
did he so often lodge in open field
in winter's cold and summer's parching heat
to conquer France his true inheritance
and did my brother Bedford toil his wits
to keep by policy what Henry got
have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham
brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick
or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself
with all the learned council of the realm
studied so long sat in the council-house
early and late debating to and fro
how France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe
and hath his highness in his infancy
been crown'd in Paris in despite of foes
and shall these labours and these honours die
shall Henry's conquest Bedford's vigilance
your deeds of war and all our counsel die
O peers of England shameful is this league
fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
blotting your names from books of memory
razing the characters of your renown
defacing monuments of conquer'd France
undoing all as all had never been

nephew what means this passionate discourse
this peroration with such circumstance

ay uncle we will keep it if we can
but now it is impossible we should
Suffolk the new-made duke that rules the roast
hath given the duchies of Anjou and Maine
unto the poor King Reignier whose large style
agrees not with the leanness of his purse

now by the death of him who died for all
these counties were the keys of Normandy
but wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son

for grief that they are past recovery
for were there hope to conquer them again
my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
Anjou and Maine myself did win them both
those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
and are the cities that I got with wounds
deliver'd up again with peaceful words

for Suffolk's duke may he be suffocate
that dims the honour of this war-like isle
France should have torn and rent my very heart
before I would have yielded to this league
I never read but England's kings have had
large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
and our King Henry gives away his own
to match with her that brings no vantages

a proper jest and never heard before
that Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
for costs and charges in transporting her
she should have stay'd in France and starv'd in France
before

my Lord of Gloucester now you grow too hot
it was the pleasure of my lord the king

'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike
but tis my presence that doth trouble ye
rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
I see thy fury If I longer stay
we shall begin our ancient bickerings
lordings farewell and say when I am gone
I prophesied France will be lost ere long


so there goes our protector in a rage
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy
nay more an enemy unto you all
and no great friend I fear me to the king
consider lords he is the next of blood
and heir apparent to the English crown
had Henry got an empire by his marriage
and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
there's reason he should be displeas'd at it
look to it lords let not his smoothing words
what though the common people favour him
calling him Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester
clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
'Jesu maintain your royal excellence
with God preserve the good Duke Humphrey
I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
he will be found a dangerous protector

why should he then protect our sovereign
he being of age to govern of himself
cousin of Somerset join you with me
and all together with the Duke of Suffolk
we'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat

this weighty business will not brook delay
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently


cousin of Buckingham though Humphrey's pride
yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
his insolence is more intolerable
than all the princes in the land beside
if Gloucester be displac'd he'll be protector

or thou or I Somerset will be protector
despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal


pride went before ambition follows him
while these do labour for their own preferment
behoves it us to labour for the realm
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
did bear him like a noble gentleman
oft have I seen the haughty cardinal
more like a soldier than a man o' the church
as stout and proud as he were lord of all
swear like a ruffian and demean himself
unlike the ruler of a commonweal
thy deeds thy plainness and thy house-keeping
have won the greatest favour of the commons
excepting none but good Duke Humphrey
and brother York thy acts in Ireland
in bringing them to civil discipline
thy late exploits done in the heart of France
when thou wert regent for our sovereign
have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people
join we together for the public good
in what we can to bridle and suppress
the pride of Suffolk and the cardinal
with Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition
and as we may cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds
while they do tend the profit of the land

so God help Warwick as he loves the land
and common profit of his country

and so says York for he hath greatest cause
then let's make haste away and look unto the main

unto the main O father Maine is lost
that Maine which by main force Warwick did win
and would have kept so long as breath did last
main chance father you meant but I meant Maine
which I will win from France or else be slain


Anjou and Maine are given to the French
Paris is lost the state of Normandy
stands on a tickle point now they are gone
Suffolk concluded on the articles
the peers agreed and Henry was well pleas'd
to change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter
I cannot blame them all what is't to them
'Tis thine they give away and not their own
pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
and purchase friends and give to courtezans
while as the silly owner of the goods
weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
while all is shar'd and all is borne away
ready to starve and dare not touch his own
so York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
while his own lands are bargain'd for and sold
methinks the realms of England France and Ireland
bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
as did the fatal brand Alth a burn'd
unto the prince's heart of Calydon
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French
cold news for me for I had hope of France
even as I have of fertile England's soil
a day will come when York shall claim his own
and therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
and make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey
and when I spy advantage claim the crown
for that's the golden mark I seek to hit
nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
nor wear the diadem upon his head
whose church-like humours fit not for a crown
then York be still awhile till time do serve
watch thou and wake when others be asleep
to pry into the secrets of the state
till Henry surfeiting in joys of love
with his new bride and England's dear-bought queen
and Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars
then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose
with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd
and in my standard bear the arms of York
to grapple with the house of Lancaster
and force perforce I'll make him yield the crown
whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down


why droops my lord like over-ripen'd corn
hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load
as frowning at the favours of the world
why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth
gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
what seest thou there King Henry's diadem
enchas'd with all the honours of the world
if so gaze on and grovel on thy face
until thy head be circled with the same
put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
what is't too short I'll lengthen it with mine
and having both together heav'd it up
we'll both together lift our heads to heaven
and never more abase our sight so low
as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground

O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord
banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
and may that thought when I imagine ill
against my king and nephew virtuous Henry
be my last breathing in this mortal world

what dream'd my lord tell me and I'll requite it
with sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream

methought this staff mine office-badge in court
was broke in twain by whom I have forgot
but as I think it was by the cardinal
and on the pieces of the broken wand
were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset
and William De la Pole first Duke of Suffolk
this was my dream what it doth bode God knows

tut this was nothing but an argument
that he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
shall lose his head for his presumption
but list to me my Humphrey my sweet duke
methought I sat in seat of majesty
in the cathedral church of Westminster
and in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd
and on my head did set the diadem

nay Eleanor then must I chide outright
presumptuous dame ill-nurtur'd Eleanor
art thou not second woman in the realm
and the protector's wife belov'd of him
hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
above the reach or compass of thy thought
and wilt thou still be hammering treachery
to tumble down thy husband and thyself
from top of honour to disgrace's feet
away from me and let me hear no more

what what my lord are you so choleric
with Eleanor for telling but her dream
next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself
and not be check'd

nay be not angry I am pleas'd again

my Lord Protector tis his highness' pleasure
you do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's
whereas the king and queen do mean to hawk

I go Come Nell thou wilt ride with us

yes my good lord I'll follow presently

follow I must I cannot go before
while Gloucester bears this base and humble mind
were I a man a duke and next of blood
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
and smooth my way upon their headless necks
and being a woman I will not be slack
to play my part in Fortune's pageant
where are you there Sir John nay fear not man
we are alone here's none but thee and I

Jesus preserve your royal majesty

what sayst thou majesty I am but Grace

but by the grace of God and Hume's advice
your Grace's title shall be multiplied

what sayst thou man hast thou as yet conferr'd
with Margery Jourdain the cunning witch
with Roger Bolingbroke the conjurer
and will they undertake to do me good

this they have promised to show your highness
a spirit rais'd from depth of under ground
that shall make answer to such questions
as by your Grace shall be propounded him

it is enough I'll think upon the questions
when from Saint Alban's we do make return
here Hume take this reward make merry man
with thy confed'rates in this weighty cause


Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold
marry and shall But how now Sir John Hume
seal up your lips and give no words but mum
the business asketh silent secrecy
dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
yet have I gold flies from another coast
I dare not say from the rich cardinal
and from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk
yet I do find it so for to be plain
they knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour
have hired me to undermine the duchess
and buzz these conjurations in her brain
they say A crafty knave does need no broker
yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker
to call them both a pair of crafty knaves
well so it stands and thus I fear at last
Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wrack
and her attainture will be Humphrey's fall
sort how it will I shall have gold for all


my masters let's stand close my Lord Protector will come this way by and by and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill

marry the Lord protect him for he's a good man Jesu bless him


here a' comes methinks and the queen with him I'll be the first sure

come back fool this is the Duke of Suffolk and not my Lord Protector

how now fellow wouldst anything with me

I pray my lord pardon me I took ye for my Lord Protector
to my Lord Protector are your supplications to his lordship Let me see them what is thine

mine is an't please your Grace against John Goodman my Lord Cardinal's man for keeping my house and lands my wife and all from me

thy wife too that is some wrong indeed What's yours What's here Against the Duke of Suffolk for enclosing the commons of Melford How now sir knave

alas sir I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township

against my master Thomas Horner for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown

what sayst thou Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown

that my master was No forsooth my master said that he was and that the king was an usurper

who is there


take this fellow in and send for his master with a pursuivant presently We'll hear more of your matter before the king

under the wings of our protector's grace
begin your suits anew and sue to him

away base cullions Suffolk let them go

come let's be gone


my Lord of Suffolk say is this the guise
is this the fashion of the court of England
is this the government of Britain's isle
and this the royalty of Albion's king
what shall King Henry be a pupil still
under the surly Gloucester's governance
am I a queen in title and in style
and must be made a subject to a duke
I tell thee Pole when in the city Tours
thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
and stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France
in courage courtship and proportion
but all his mind is bent to holiness
to number Ave-Maries on his beads
his champions are the prophets and apostles
his weapons holy saws of sacred writ
his study is his tilt-yard and his loves
are brazen images of canoniz'd saints
I would the college of the cardinals
would choose him pope and carry him to Rome
and set the triple crown upon his head
that were a state fit for his holiness

madam be patient as I was cause
your highness came to England so will I
in England work your Grace's full content

beside the haught protector have we Beaufort
the imperious churchman Somerset Buckingham
and grumbling York and not the least of these

and he of these that can do most of all
cannot do more in England than the Nevils
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers

not all these lords do vex me half so much
as that proud dame the Lord Protector's wife
she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
more like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife
strangers in court do take her for the queen
she bears a duke's revenues on her back
and in her heart she scorns our poverty
shall I not live to be aveng'd on her
contemptuous base-born callot as she is
she vaunted mongst her minions t'other day
the very train of her worst wearing gown
was better worth than all my father's lands
till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter

and plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
that she will light to listen to the lays
and never mount to trouble you again
so let her rest and madam list to me
for I am bold to counsel you in this
although we fancy not the cardinal
yet must we join with him and with the lords
till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace
as for the Duke of York this late complaint
will make but little for his benefit
so one by one we'll weed them all at last
and you yourself shall steer the happy helm

for my part noble lords I care not which
or Somerset or York all's one to me

if York have ill demean'd himself in France
then let him be denay'd the regentship

let York be regent I will yield to him

whether your Grace be worthy yea or no
dispute not that York is the worthier

ambitious Warwick let thy betters speak

the cardinal's not my better in the field

all in this presence are thy betters Warwick

Warwick may live to be the best of all

peace son and show some reason Buckingham
why Somerset should be preferr'd in this

because the king forsooth will have it so

madam the king is old enough himself

if he be old enough what needs your Grace
to be protector of his excellence

madam I am protector of the realm
and at his pleasure will resign my place

resign it then and leave thine insolence
since thou wertking as who is king but thou
the commonwealth hath daily run to wrack
the Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas
and all the peers and nobles of the realm
have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty

the commons hast thou rack'd the clergy's bags
are lank and lean with thy extortions

thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
have cost a mass of public treasury
thy cruelty in execution
upon offenders hath exceeded law
and left thee to the mercy of the law

thy sale of offices and towns in France
if they were known as the suspect is great
would make thee quickly hop without thy head

give me my fan what minion can ye not

I cry you mercy madam was it you

was't I yea I it was proud Frenchwoman
could I come near your beauty with my nails
I'd set my ten commandments in your face

sweet aunt be quiet twas against her will

against her will Good king look to't in time
though in this place most master wear no breeches
she shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd


lord Cardinal I will follow Eleanor
and listen after Humphrey how he proceeds
she's tickled now her fume can need no spurs
she'll gallop far enough to her destruction

now lords my choler being over-blown
with walking once about the quadrangle
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs
as for your spiteful false objections
prove them and I lie open to the law
but God in mercy so deal with my soul
as I in duty love my king and country
but to the matter that we have in hand
I say my sov'reign York is meetest man
to be your regent in the realm of France
before we make election give me leave
to show some reason of no little force
that York is most unmeet of any man

I'll tell thee Suffolk why I am unmeet
first for I cannot flatter thee in pride
next if I be appointed for the place
my Lord of Somerset will keep me here
without discharge money or furniture
till France be won into the Dauphin's hands
last time I danc'd attendance on his will
till Paris was besieg'd famish'd and lost

that can I witness and a fouler fact
did never traitor in the land commit

peace headstrong Warwick

image of pride why should I hold my peace

because here is a man accus'd of treason
pray God the Duke of York excuse himself

doth any one accuse York for a traitor

what mean'st thou Suffolk tell me what are these

please it your majesty this is the man
that doth accuse his master of high treason
his words were these that Richard Duke of York
was rightful heir unto the English crown
and that your majesty was a usurper

say man were these thy words

an't shall please your majesty I never said nor thought any such matter God is my witness I am falsely accused by the villain

by these ten bones my lords he did speak them to me in the garret one night as we were scouring my Lord of York's armour
base dunghill villain and mechanical
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech
I do beseech your royal majesty
let him have all the rigour of the law

alas my lord hang me if ever I spake the words My accuser is my prentice and when I did correct him for his fault the other day he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me I have good witness of this therefore I beseech your majesty do not cast away an honest man for a villain's accusation

uncle what shall we say to this in law

this doom my lord if I may judge
let Somerset be regent o'er the French
because in York this breeds suspicion
and let these have a day appointed them
for single combat in convenient place
for he hath witness of his servant's malice
this is the law and this Duke Humphrey's doom

then be it so My Lord of Somerset
we make your Grace lord regent o'er the French
I humbly thank your royal majesty

and I accept the combat willingly

alas my lord I cannot fight for God's sake pity my case the spite of man prevaileth against me O Lord have mercy upon me I shall never be able to fight a blow O Lord my heart

sirrah or you must fight or else be hang'd

away with them to prison and the day
of combat shall be the last of the next month
come Somerset we'll see thee sent away


come my masters the duchess I tell you expects performance of your promises

master Hume we are therefore provided Will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms

ay what else fear you not her courage


mother Jourdain be you prostrate and grovel on the earth John Southwell read you and let us to our work


well said my masters and welcome all
to this gear the sooner the better

patience good lady wizards know their times
deep night dark night the silent of the night
the time of night when Troy was set on fire
the time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl
and spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves
that time best fits the work we have in hand
madam sit you and fear not whom we raise
we will make fast within a hallow'd verge


adsum

by the eternal God whose name and power
thou tremblest at answer that I shall ask
for till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence

ask what thou wilt That I had said and done

first of the king what shall of him become

the Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose
but him outlive and die a violent death


what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk

by water shall he die and take his end

what shall befall the Duke of Somerset

let him shun castles
than where castles mounted stand
have done for more I hardly can endure

descend to darkness and the burning lake
false fiend avoid

lay hands upon these traitors and their trash
beldam I think we watch'd you at an inch
what madam are you there the king and commonweal
are deeply indebted for this piece of pains
my Lord Protector will I doubt it not
see you well guerdon'd for these good deserts

not half so bad as thine to England's king
injurious duke that threat'st where is no cause

true madam none at all What call you this

away with them let them be clapp'd up close
Stafford take her to thee

we'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming
all away


lord Buckingham methinks you watch'd her well
a pretty plot well chosen to build upon
now pray my lord let's see the devil's writ
what have we here
the duke yet lives that Henry shall depose
but him outlive and die a violent death
why this is just
aio te acida Romanos vincere posse
well to the rest
tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk
by water shall he die and take his end
what shall betide the Duke of Somerset
let him shun castles
than where castles mounted stand
come come my lords these oracles
are hardly attain'd and hardly understood
the king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's
with him the husband of this lovely lady
thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them
a sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector

your Grace shall give me leave my Lord of York
to be the post in hope of his reward

at your pleasure my good lord Who's within there ho


invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
to sup with me to-morrow night Away


believe me lords for flying at the brook
yet by your leave the wind was very high
and ten to one old Joan had not gone out

but what a point my lord your falcon made
and what a pitch she flew above the rest
to see how God in all his creatures works
yea man and birds are fain of climbing high

no marvel an it like your majesty
my Lord Protector's hawks do tower so well
they know their master loves to be aloft
and bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch

my lord tis but a base ignoble mind
that mounts no higher than a bird can soar

I thought as much he'd be above the clouds

ay my Lord Cardinal how think you by that

the treasury of everlasting joy

thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts
beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart
pernicious protector dangerous peer
that smooth'st it so with king and commonweal

what cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory
tant ne animis c lestibus ir
churchmen so hot good uncle hide such malice
with such holiness can you do it

no malice sir no more than well becomes
so good a quarrel and so bad a peer

as who my lord

why as you my lord

why Suffolk England knows thine insolence

and thy ambition Gloucester

I prithee peace
good queen and whet not on these furious peers
for blessed are the peacemakers on earth

let me be blessed for the peace I make
against this proud protector with my sword

faith holy uncle would twere come to that

marry when thou dar'st

make up no factious numbers for the matter
in thine own person answer thy abuse

this evening on the east side of the grove

how now my lords

believe me cousin Gloucester
had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly
we had had more sport

come with thy two-hand sword

true uncle

are you advis'd

the east side of the grove

cardinal I am with you

why how now uncle Gloucester
talking of hawking nothing else my lord


now by God's mother priest I'll shave your crown
for this or all my fence shall fail

medice teipsum
protector see to't well protect yourself

the winds grow high so do your stomachs lords
how irksome is this music to my heart
when such strings jar what hope of harmony
I pray my lords let me compound this strife


what means this noise
fellow what miracle dost thou proclaim

a miracle a miracle
come to the king and tell him what miracle

forsooth a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine
within this half hour hath receiv'd his sight
a man that ne'er saw in his life before

now God be prais'd that to believing souls
gives light in darkness comfort in despair

here comes the townsmen on procession
to present your highness with the man

great is his comfort in this earthly vale
although by his sight his sin be multiplied

stand by my masters bring him near the king
his highness' pleasure is to talk with him

good fellow tell us here the circumstance
what hast thou been long blind and now restor'd

born blind an't please your Grace

ay indeed was he

what woman is this

his wife an't like your worship

hadst thou been his mother thou couldst have better told

where wert thou born

at Berwick in the north an't like your Grace

poor soul God's goodness hath been great to thee
let never day nor night unhallow'd pass
but still remember what the Lord hath done
tell me good fellow cam'st thou here by chance
or of devotion to this holy shrine

God knows of pure devotion being call'd
a hundred times and oft'ner in my sleep
by good Saint Alban who said Simpcox come
come offer at my shrine and I will help thee

most true forsooth and many time and oft
myself have heard a voice to call him so

what art thou lame

ay God Almighty help me

how cam'st thou so

a fall off of a tree


how long hast thou been blind

O born so master

what and wouldst climb a tree

but that in all my life when I was a youth

too true and bought his climbing very dear

mass thou lov'dst plums well that wouldst venture so

alas master my wife desir'd some damsons
and made me climb with danger of my life

a subtle knave but yet it shall not serve
let me see thine eyes wink now now open them
in my opinion yet thou seest not well
yes master clear as day I thank God and Saint Alban

sayst thou me so What colour is this cloak of

red master red as blood

why that's well said What colour is my gown of

black forsooth coal-black as jet

why then thou know'st what colour jet is of

and yet I think jet did he never see

but cloaks and gowns before this day a many

never before this day in all his life

tell me sirrah what's my name
alas master I know not

what's his name

I know not

nor his

no indeed master

what's thine own name

Saunder Simpcox an if it please you master

then Saunder sit there the lyingest knave in Christendom If thou hadst been born blind thou mightst as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear Sight may distinguish of colours but suddenly to nominate them all it is impossible My lords Saint Alban here hath done a miracle and would ye not think that cunning to be great that could restore this cripple to his legs again

O master that you could

my masters of Saint Alban's have you not beadles in your town and things called whips
yes my lord if it please your Grace

then send for one presently

sirrah go fetch the beadle hither straight


now fetch me a stool hither by and by


now sirrah if you mean to save yourself from whipping leap me over this stool and run away

alas master I am not able to stand alone
you go about to torture me in vain


well sir we must have you find your legs Sirrah beadle whip him till he leap over that same stool

I will my lord Come on sirrah off with your doublet quickly
alas master what shall I do I am not able to stand

O God seest thou this and bear'st so long

it made me laugh to see the villain run

follow the knave and take this drab away

alas sir we did it for pure need

let them be whipp'd through every market town
till they come to Berwick from whence they came


duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day

true made the lame to leap and fly away

but you have done more miracles than I


what tidings with our cousin Buckingham

such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
a sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
under the countenance and confederacy
of Lady Eleanor the protector's wife
the ringleader and head of all this rout
have practis'd dangerously against your state
dealing with witches and with conjurers
whom we have apprehended in the fact
raising up wicked spirits from under-ground
demanding of King Henry's life and death
and other of your highness' privy council
as more at large your Grace shall understand

and so my Lord Protector by this means
your lady is forthcoming yet at London
'Tis like my lord you will not keep your hour

ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers
and vanquish'd as I am I yield to thee
or to the meanest groom

O God what mischiefs work the wicked ones
heaping confusion on their own heads thereby

Gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
and look thyself be faultless thou wert best

madam for myself to heaven I do appeal
how I have lov'd my king and commonweal
and for my wife I know not how it stands
sorry I am to hear what I have heard
noble she is but if she have forgot
honour and virtue and convers'd with such
I banish her my bed and company
and give her as a prey to law and shame
that hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name

well for this night we will repose us here
to-morrow toward London back again
to look into this business thoroughly
and call these foul offenders to their answers
and poise the cause in justice' equal scales
whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails


now my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
our simple supper ended give me leave
in this close walk to satisfy myself
in craving your opinion of my title
which is infallible to England's crown

my lord I long to hear it at full
sweet York begin and if thy claim be good
the Nevils are thy subjects to command

then thus
Edward the Third my lords had seven sons
the first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales
the second William of Hatfield and the third
Lionel Duke of Clarence next to whom
was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster
the fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York
the sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester
William of Windsor was the seventh and last
Edward the Black Prince died before his father
and left behind him Richard his only son
who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king
till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster
the eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt
crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth
seiz'd on the realm depos'd the rightful king
and him to Pomfret where as all you know
harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously

father the duke hath told the truth
thus got the house of Lancaster the crown

which now they hold by force and not by right
for Richard the first son's heir being dead
the issue of the next son should have reign'd

but William of Hatfield died without an heir

the third son Duke of Clarence from whose line
I claim the crown had issue Philippe a daughter
who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March
Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March
Roger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor

this Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke
and but for Owen Glendower had been king
who kept him in captivity till he died
but to the rest

his eldest sister Anne
my mother being heir unto the crown
married Richard Earl of Cambridge who was son
to Edmund Langley Edward the Third's fifth son
by her I claim the kingdom she was heir
to Roger Earl of March who was the son
of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippe
sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence
so if the issue of the eldest son
succeed before the younger I am king

what plain proceeding is more plain than this
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt
the fourth son York claims it from the third
till Lionel's issue fails his should not reign
and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
then father Salisbury kneel we together
and in this private plot be we the first
that shall salute our rightful sovereign
with honour of his birthright to the crown

long live our sovereign Richard England's king

we thank you lords But I am not your king
till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
with heart-blood of the house of Lancaster
and that's not suddenly to be perform'd
but with advice and silent secrecy
do you as I do in these dangerous days
wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence
at Beaufort's pride at Somerset's ambition
at Buckingham and all the crew of them
till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock
that virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey
shall find their deaths if York can prophesy

my lord break we off we know your mind at full

my heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
shall one day make the Duke of York a king

and Nevil this I do assure myself
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
the greatest man in England but the king


stand forth Dame Eleanor Cobham Gloucester's wife
in sight of God and us your guilt is great
receive the sentence of the law for sins
such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death
you four from hence to prison back again
from thence unto the place of execution
the witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes
you madam for you are more nobly born
despoiled of your honour in your life
shall after three days' open penance done
live in your country here in banishment
with Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man

welcome is banishment welcome were my death

Eleanor the law thou seest hath judged thee
I cannot justify whom the law condemns

mine eyes are full of tears my heart of grief
Ah Humphrey this dishonour in thine age
will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground
I beseech your majesty give me leave to go
sorrow would solace and mine age would ease

stay Humphrey Duke of Gloucester ere thou go
give up thy staff Henry will to himself
my stay my guide and lantern to my feet
and go in peace Humphrey no less belov'd
than when thou wert protector to thy king

I see no reason why a king of years
should be to be protected like a child
God and King Henry govern England's helm
give up your staff sir and the king his realm

my staff here noble Henry is my staff
as willingly do I the same resign
as e'er thy father Henry made it mine
and even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
as others would ambitiously receive it
farewell good king when I am dead and gone
may honourable peace attend thy throne


why now is Henry king and Margaret queen
that bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once
his lady banish'd and a limb lopp'd off
this staff of honour raught there let it stand
where it best fits to be in Henry's hand

thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays
thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days

lords let him go Please it your majesty
this is the day appointed for the combat
and ready are the appellant and defendant
the armourer and his man to enter the lists
so please your highness to behold the fight

ay good my lord for purposely therefore
left I the court to see this quarrel tried

o' God's name see the lists and all things fit
here let them end it and God defend the right
I never saw a fellow worse bested
or more afraid to fight than is the appellant
the servant of this armourer my lords


here neighbour Horner I drink to you in a cup of sack and fear not neighbour you shall do well enough

and here neighbour here's a cup of charneco

and here's a pot of good double beer neighbour drink and fear not your man

let it come i' faith and I'll pledge you all and a fig for Peter

here Peter I drink to thee and be not afraid

be merry Peter and fear not thy master fight for credit of the prentices

I thank you all drink and pray for me I pray you for I think I have taken my last draught in this world Here Robin an if I die I give thee my apron and Will thou shalt have my hammer and here Tom take all the money that I have O Lord bless me I pray God for I am never able to deal with my master he hath learnt so much fence already


Peter forsooth

Peter what more

thump

thump then see thou thump thy master well

masters I am come hither as it were upon my man's instigation to prove him a knave and myself an honest man and touching the Duke of York I will take my death I never meant him any ill nor the king nor the queen and therefore Peter have at thee with a downright blow

dispatch this knave's tongue begins to double
sound trumpets alarum to the combatants


hold Peter hold I confess I confess treason


take away his weapon Fellow thank

O God have I overcome mine enemies in this presence O Peter thou hast prevailed in right

go take hence that traitor from our sight
for by his death we do perceive his guilt
and God in justice hath reveal'd to us
the truth and innocence of this poor fellow
which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully
come fellow follow us for thy reward


thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud
and after summer evermore succeeds
barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold
so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
sirs what's o'clock

ten my lord

to watch the coming of my punish'd duchess
uneath may she endure the flinty streets
to tread them with her tender-feeling feet
sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
the abject people gazing on thy face
with envious looks still laughing at thy shame
that erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels
when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
but soft I think she comes and I'll prepare
my tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries


so please your Grace we'll take her from the sheriff

no stir not for your lives let her pass by

come you my lord to see my open shame
now thou dost penance too Look how they gaze
see how the giddy multitude do point
Ah Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
and in thy closet pent up rue my shame
and ban thine enemies both mine and thine

be patient gentle Nell forget this grief

ay Gloucester teach me to forget myself
for whilst I think I am thy wedded wife
and thou a prince protector of this land
methinks I should not thus be led along
mail'd up in shame with papers on my back
and follow'd with a rabble that rejoice
to see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans
the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
and when I start the envious people laugh
and bid me be advised how I tread
Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke
trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world
or count them happy that enjoy the sun
to think upon my pomp shall be my hell
sometime I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife
and he a prince and ruler of the land
yet so he rul'd and such a prince he was
as he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess
was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
to every idle rascal follower
but be thou mild and blush not at my shame
nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
hang over thee as sure it shortly will
for Suffolk he that can do all in all
with her that hateth thee and hates us all
and York and impious Beaufort that false priest
have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings
and fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee
but fear not thou until thy foot be snar'd
nor never seek prevention of thy foes

Ah Nell forbear thou aimest all awry
and had I twenty times so many foes
and each of them had twenty times their power
all these could not procure me any scath
so long as I am loyal true and crimeless
wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
why yet thy scandal were not wip'd away
but I in danger for the breach of law
thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell
I pray thee sort thy heart to patience
these few days' wonder will be quickly worn


I summon your Grace to his majesty's parliament holden at Bury the first of this next month

and my consent ne'er ask'd herein before
this is close dealing Well I will be there

my Nell I take my leave and master sheriff
let not her penance exceed the king's commission
an't please your Grace here my commission stays
and Sir John Stanley is appointed now
to take her with him to the Isle of Man

must you Sir John protect my lady here

so am I given in charge may't please your Grace

entreat her not the worse in that I pray
you use her well The world may laugh again
and I may live to do you kindness if
you do it her and so Sir John farewell

what gone my lord and bid me not farewell

witness my tears I cannot stay to speak


art thou gone too All comfort go with thee
death at whose name I oft have been afear'd
because I wish'd this world's eternity
Stanley I prithee go and take me hence
I care not whither for I beg no favour
only convey me where thou art commanded

why madam that is to the Isle of Man
there to be us'd according to your state

that's bad enough for I am but reproach
and shall I then be us'd reproachfully

like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey's lady
according to that state you shall be us'd

sheriff farewell and better than I fare
although thou hast been conduct of my shame

it is my office and madam pardon me
ay ay farewell thy office is discharg'd
come Stanley shall we go

madam your penance done throw off this sheet
and go we to attire you for our journey

my shame will not be shifted with my sheet
no it will hang upon my richest robes
and show itself attire me how I can
go lead the way I long to see my prison


I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
whate'er occasion keeps him from us now

can you not see or will ye not observe
the strangeness of his alter'd countenance
with what a majesty he bears himself
how proud how peremptory and unlike himself
we know the time since he was mild and affable
an if we did but glance a far-off look
immediately he was upon his knee
that all the court admir'd him for submission
but meet him now and be it in the morn
when everyone will give the time of day
he knits his brow and shows an angry eye
and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
disdaining duty that to us belongs
small curs are not regarded when they grin
but great men tremble when the lion roars
and Humphrey is no little man in England
first note that he is near you in descent
and should you fall he is the next will mount
me seemeth then it is no policy
respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
and his advantage following your decease
that he should come about your royal person
by flattery hath he won the commons' hearts
and when he please to make commotion
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him
now tis the spring and weeds are shallow-rooted
suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden
and choke the herbs for want of husbandry
the reverent care I bear unto my lord
made me collect these dangers in the duke
if it be fond call it a woman's fear
which fear if better reasons can supplant
I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke
my Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York
reprove my allegation if you can
or else conclude my words effectual

well hath your highness seen into this duke
and had I first been put to speak my mind
I think I should have told your Grace's tale
the duchess by his subornation
or if he were not privy to those faults
yet by reputing of his high descent
as next the king he was successive heir
and such high vaunts of his nobility
did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
by wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall
smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
and in his simple show he harbours treason
the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
no no my sov'reign Gloucester is a man
unsounded yet and full of deep deceit

did he not contrary to form of law
devise strange deaths for small offences done

and did he not in his protectorship
levy great sums of money through the realm
for soldiers' pay in France and never sent it
by means whereof the towns each day revolted
tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey

my lords at once the care you have of us
to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience
our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
from meaning treason to our royal person
as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
to dream on evil or to work my downfall

Ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance
seems he a dove his feathers are but borrow'd
for he's disposed as the hateful raven
is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him
for he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf
who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
take heed my lord the welfare of us all


all health unto my gracious sovereign

welcome Lord Somerset What news from France

that all your interest in those territories
is utterly bereft you all is lost

cold news Lord Somerset but God's will be done

cold news for me for I had hope of France
as firmly as I hope for fertile England
thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
and caterpillars eat my leaves away
but I will remedy this gear ere long
or sell my title for a glorious grave


pardon my liege that I have stay'd so long

nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon
unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
I do arrest thee of high treason here

well Suffolk's duke thou shalt not see me blush
nor change my countenance for this arrest
a heart unspotted is not easily daunted
the purest spring is not so free from mud
as I am clear from treason to my sovereign
who can accuse me wherein am I guilty

'Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France
and being protector stay'd the soldiers' pay
by means whereof his highness hath lost France

is it but thought so What are they that think it
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
so help me God as I have watch'd the night
ay night by night in studying good for England
that doit that e'er I wrested from the king
or any groat I hoarded to my use
be brought against me at my trial-day
no many a pound of mine own proper store
because I would not tax the needy commons
have I disbursed to the garrisons
and never ask'd for restitution

it serves you well my lord to say so much

I say no more than truth so help me God

in your protectorship you did devise
strange tortures for offenders never heard of
that England was defam'd by tyranny

why tis well known that whiles I was protector
for I should melt at an offender's tears
and lowly words were ransom for their fault
unless it were a bloody murderer
or foul felonious thief that fleec'd poor passengers
I never gave them condign punishment
murder indeed that bloody sin I tortur'd
above the felon or what trespass else

my lord these faults are easy quickly answer'd
but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
I do arrest you in his highness' name
and here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
to keep until your further time of trial

my Lord of Gloucester tis my special hope
that you will clear yourself from all suspect
my conscience tells me you are innocent

virtue is chok'd with foul ambition
and charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand
foul subornation is predominant
and equity exil'd your highness' land
I know their complot is to have my life
and if my death might make this island happy
and prove the period of their tyranny
I would expend it with all willingness
but mine is made the prologue to their play
for thousands more that yet suspect no peril
will not conclude their plotted tragedy
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
and Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate
sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
the envious load that lies upon his heart
and dogged York that reaches at the moon
whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back
by false accuse doth level at my life
and you my sov'reign lady with the rest
and with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
my liefest liege to be mine enemy
ay all of you have laid your heads together
myself had notice of your conventicles
and all to make away my guiltless life
I shall not want false witness to condemn me
nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
the ancient proverb will be well effected
'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog

my liege his railing is intolerable
if those that care to keep your royal person
from treason's secret knife and traitor's rage
be thus upbraided chid and rated at
and the offender granted scope of speech
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace

hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
with ignominious words though clerkly couch'd
false allegations to o'erthrow his state

but I can give the loser leave to chide

far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed
beshrew the winners for they play'd me false
and well such losers may have leave to speak

he'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
lord Cardinal he is your prisoner

sirs take away the duke and guard him sure

Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch
before his legs be firm to bear his body
thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
Ah that my fear were false ah that it were
for good King Henry thy decay I fear

my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
do or undo as if ourself were here

what will your highness leave the parliament

ay Margaret my heart is drown'd with grief
whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
my body round engirt with misery
for what's more miserable than discontent
Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see
the map of honour truth and loyalty
and yet good Humphrey is the hour to come
that e'er I prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith
what low'ring star now envies thy estate
that these great lords and Margaret our queen
do seek subversion of thy harmless life
thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
and as the butcher takes away the calf
bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house
even so remorseless have they borne him hence
and as the dam runs lowing up and down
looking the way her harmless young one went
and can do nought but wail her darling's loss
even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
with sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes
look after him and cannot do him good
so mighty are his vowed enemies
his fortunes I will weep and twixt each groan
say Who's a traitor Gloucester he is none


fair lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs
too full of foolish pity and Gloucester's show
beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
with sorrow snares relenting passengers
or as the snake roll'd in a flow'ring bank
that for the beauty thinks it excellent
believe me lords were none more wise than I
and yet herein I judge mine own wit good
this Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
to rid us from the fear we have of him

that he should die is worthy policy
and yet we want a colour for his death
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law

but in my mind that were no policy
the king will labour still to save his life
the commons haply rise to save his life
and yet we have but trivial argument
more than mistrust that shows him worthy death

so that by this you would not have him die

Ah York no man alive so fain as I
'Tis York that hath more reason for his death
but my Lord Cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk
say as you think and speak it from your souls
were't not all one an empty eagle were set
to guard the chicken from a hungry kite
as place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector

so the poor chicken should be sure of death

madam tis true and were't not madness then
to make the fox surveyor of the fold
who being accus'd a crafty murderer
his guilt should be but idly posted over
because his purpose is not executed
no let him die in that he is a fox
by nature prov'd an enemy to the flock
before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood
as Humphrey prov'd by reasons to my liege
and do not stand on quillets how to slay him
sleeping or waking tis no matter how
so he be dead for that is good deceit
which mates him first that first intends deceit

thrice noble Suffolk tis resolutely spoke

not resolute except so much were done
for things are often spoke and seldom meant
but that my heart accordeth with my tongue
seeing the deed is meritorious
and to preserve my sovereign from his foe
say but the word and I will be his priest

but I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk
ere you can take due orders for a priest
say you consent and censure well the deed
and I'll provide his executioner
I tender so the safety of my liege


and so say I

and I and now we three have spoke it
it skills not greatly who impugns our doom


great lords from Ireland am I come amain
to signify that rebels there are up
and put the Englishmen unto the sword
send succours lords and stop the rage betime
before the wound do grow uncurable
for being green there is great hope of help

a breach that craves a quick expedient stop
what counsel give you in this weighty cause

that Somerset be sent as regent thither
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd

if York with all his far-fet policy
had been the regent there instead of me
he never would have stay'd in France so long

no not to lose it all as thou hast done
I rather would have lost my life betimes
than bring a burden of dishonour home
by staying there so long till all were lost
show me one scar character'd on thy skin
men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win

nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
no more good York sweet Somerset be still
thy fortune York hadst thou been regent there
might happily have prov'd far worse than his

what worse than nought nay then a shame take all
and in the number thee that wishest shame

my Lord of York try what your fortune is
the uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
and temper clay with blood of Englishmen
to Ireland will you lead a band of men
collected choicely from each county some
and try your hap against the Irishmen

I will my lord so please his majesty

why our authority is his consent
and what we do establish he confirms
then noble York take thou this task in hand

I am content provide me soldiers lords
whiles I take order for mine own affairs

a charge Lord York that I will see perform'd

no more of him for I will deal with him
that henceforth he shall trouble us no more
and so break off the day is almost spent
lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event

my Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days
at Bristol I expect my soldiers
for there I'll ship them all for Ireland

I'll see it truly done my Lord of York


now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts
and change misdoubt to resolution
be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art
resign to death it is not worth the enjoying
let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man
and find no harbour in a royal heart
and not a thought but thinks on dignity
my brain more busy than the labouring spider
weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
well nobles well tis politicly done
to send me packing with a host of men
I fear me you but warm the starved snake
who cherish'd in your breasts will sting your hearts
'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me
I take it kindly yet be well assur'd
you put sharp weapons in a madman's hands
whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band
I will stir up in England some black storm
shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
until the golden circuit on my head
like to the glorious sun's transparent beams
do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw
and for a minister of my intent
I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman
to make commotion as full well he can
under the title of John Mortimer
in Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
oppose himself against a troop of kerns
and fought so long till that his thighs with darts
were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine
and in the end being rescu'd I have seen
him caper upright like a wild Morisco
shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
full often like a shag-hair'd crafty kern
hath he conversed with the enemy
and undiscover'd come to me again
and given me notice of their villanies
this devil here shall be my substitute
for that John Mortimer which now is dead
in face in gait in speech he doth resemble
by this I shall perceive the commons' mind
how they affect the house and claim of York
say he be taken rack'd and tortured
will make him say I mov'd him to those arms
say that he thrive as tis great like he will
why then from Ireland come I with my strength
and reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd
for Humphrey being dead as he shall be
and Henry put apart the next for me


run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know
we have dispatch'd the duke as he commanded

O that it were to do What have we done
didst ever hear a man so penitent


here comes my lord

now sirs have you dispatch'd this thing


why that's well said Go get you to my house
I will reward you for this venturous deed
the king and all the peers are here at hand
have you laid fair the bed is all things well
according as I gave directions

'Tis my good lord

away be gone

go call our uncle to our presence straight
say we intend to try his Grace to-day
if he be guilty as tis published

I'll call him presently my noble lord


lords take your places and I pray you all
than from true evidence of good esteem
he be approv'd in practice culpable

God forbid any malice should prevail
that faultless may condemn a nobleman
pray God he may acquit him of suspicion

I thank thee Meg these words content me much


how now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou

where is our uncle what's the matter Suffolk

dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead

marry God forfend

God's secret judgment I did dream to-night


how fares my lord Help lords the king is dead

rear up his body wring him by the nose

run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes

he doth revive again Madam be patient

O heavenly God

how fares my gracious lord

comfort my sovereign grocious Henry comfort

what doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me
came he right now to sing a raven's note
whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers
by crying comfort from a hollow breast
can chase away the first-conceived sound
hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words
lay not thy hands on me forbear I say
their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting
thou baleful messenger out of my sight
upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
sits in grim majesty to fright the world
look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
yet do not go away come basilisk
and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
for in the shade of death I shall find joy
in life but double death now Gloucester's dead

why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus
although the duke was enemy to him
yet he most Christian-like laments his death
and for myself foe as he was to me
might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
I would be blind with weeping sick with groans
look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs
and all to have the noble duke alive
what know I how the world may deem of me
for it is known we were but hollow friends
it may be judg'd I made the duke away
so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded
and princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach
this get I by his death Ay me unhappy
to be a queen and crown'd with infamy

Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man

be woe for me more wretched than he is
what dost thou turn away and hide thy face
I am no loathsome leper look on me
what art thou like the adder waxen deaf
be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb
erect his statua and worship it
and make my image but an alehouse sign
was I for this nigh wrack'd upon the sea
and twice by awkward wind from England's bank
drove back again unto my native clime
what boded this but well forewarning wind
did seem to say Seek not a scorpion's nest
nor set no footing on this unkind shore
what did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts
and he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves
and bid them blow towards England's blessed shore
or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
yet olus would not be a murderer
but left that hateful office unto thee
the pretty vaulting sea refus'd to drown me
knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
the splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
and would not dash me with their ragged sides
might in thy palace perish Margaret
as far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs
when from thy shore the tempest beat us back
I stood upon the hatches in the storm
and when the dusky sky began to rob
my earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view
I took a costly jewel from my neck
a heart it was bound in with diamonds
and threw it towards thy land the sea receiv'd it
and so I wish'd thy body might my heart
and even with this I lost fair England's view
and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
and call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
for losing ken of Albion's wished coast
how often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue
the agent of thy foul inconstancy
to sit and witch me as Ascanius did
when he to madding Dido would unfold
his father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy
ay me I can no more Die Margaret
for Henry weeps that thou dost live so long

it is reported mighty sovereign
that good Duke Humphrey trait'rously is murder'd
by Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means
the commons like an angry hive of bees
that want their leader scatter up and down
and care not who they sting in his revenge
myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
until they hear the order of his death

that he is dead good Warwick tis too true
but how he died God knows not Henry
enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
and comment then upon his sudden death

that shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury
with the rude multitude till I return

O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life
if my suspect be false forgive me God
for judgment only doth belong to thee
fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
with twenty thousand kisses and to drain
upon his face an ocean of salt tears
to tell my love unto his deaf dumb trunk
and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
but all in vain are these mean obsequies
and to survey his dead and earthly image
what were it but to make my sorrow greater


come hither gracious sovereign view this body

that is to see how deep my grave is made
for seeing him I see my life in death

as surely as my soul intends to live
with that dread King that took our state upon him
to free us from his Father's wrathful curse
I do believe that violent hands were laid
upon the life of this thrice-famed duke

a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
what instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow

see how the blood is settled in his face
oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost
of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
being all descended to the labouring heart
who in the conflict that it holds with death
attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy
which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
to blush and beautify the cheek again
his eyeballs further out than when he liv'd
staring full ghastly like a strangled man
his hair uprear'd his nostrils stretch'd with struggling
his hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd
and tugg'd for life and was by strength subdu'd
look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
his well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged
like to the summer's corn by tempest lodg'd
it cannot be but he was murder'd here
the least of all these signs were probable

why Warwick who should do the duke to death
myself and Beaufort had him in protection
and we I hope sir are no murderers

but both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes
and you forsooth had the good duke to keep
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend
and tis well seen he found an enemy
then you belike suspect these noblemen
as guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death

who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
and sees fast by a butcher with an axe
but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter
who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest
but may imagine how the bird was dead
although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
even so suspicious is this tragedy

are you the butcher Suffolk where's your knife
is Beaufort term'd a kite where are his talons

I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
but here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease
that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
that slanders me with murder's crimson badge
say if thou dar'st proud Lord of Warwickshire


what dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him

he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
nor cease to be an arrogant controller
though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times

madam be still with reverence may I say
for every word you speak in his behalf
is slander to your royal dignity

blunt-witted lord ignoble in demeanour
if ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
thy mother took into her blameful bed
some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock
was graft with crab-tree slip whose fruit thou art
and never of the Nevils' noble race

and I should rob the deathsman of his fee
quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
and that my sov'reign's presence makes me mild
I would false murd'rous coward on thy knee
make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
that thou thyself wast born in bastardy
and after all this fearful homage done
give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men

thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood
if from this presence thou dar'st go with me

away even now or I will drag thee hence
unworthy though thou art I'll cope with thee
and do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost


thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just
and he but naked though lock'd up in steel
whose conscience with injustice is corrupted

what noise is this

why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
here in our presence dare you be so bold
why what tumultuous clamour have we here

the traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
set all upon me mighty sovereign


sirs stand apart the king shall know your mind
dread lord the commons send you word by me
unless false Suffolk straight be done to death
or banished fair England's territories
they will by violence tear him from your palace
they say by him the good Duke Humphrey died
they say in him they fear your highness' death
and mere instinct of love and loyalty
free from a stubborn opposite intent
as being thought to contradict your liking
makes them thus forward in his banishment
they say in care of your most royal person
that if your highness should intend to sleep
and charge that no man should disturb your rest
in pain of your dislike or pain of death
yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
that slily glided towards your majesty
it were but necessary you were wak'd
lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber
the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
and therefore do they cry though you forbid
that they will guard you whe'r you will or no
from such fell serpents as false Suffolk is
your loving uncle twenty times his worth
they say is shamefully bereft of life

an answer from the king my Lord of Salisbury

'Tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds
could send such message to their sovereign
but you my lord were glad to be employ'd
to show how quaint an orator you are
but all the honour Salisbury hath won
is that he was the lord ambassador
sent from a sort of tinkers to the king

an answer from the king or we will all break in

go Salisbury and tell them all from me
I thank them for their tender loving care
and had I not been cited so by them
yet did I purpose as they do entreat
mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means
and therefore by his majesty I swear
whose far unworthy deputy I am
he shall not breathe infection in this air
but three days longer on the pain of death


O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk

ungentle queen to call him gentle Suffolk
no more I say if thou dost plead for him
thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
had I but said I would have kept my word
but when I swear it is irrevocable


if after three days' space thou here be'st found
on any ground that I am ruler of
the world shall not be ransom for thy life
I have great matters to impart to thee


mischance and sorrow go along with you
heart's discontent and sour affliction
be playfellows to keep you company
there's two of you the devil make a third
and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps

cease gentle queen these execrations
and let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave

fie coward woman and soft-hearted wretch
hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy

a plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them
would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan
I would invent as bitter-searching terms
as curst as harsh and horrible to hear
with full as many signs of deadly hate
as lean-fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave
my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
my hair be fix'd on end as one distract
ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
and even now my burden'd heart would break
should I not curse them Poison be their drink
gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks
their softest touch as smart as lizard's stings
their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
and boding screech-owls make the concert full
all the foul terrors in dark-seated hell

enough sweet Suffolk thou torment'st thyself
and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass
or like an over-charged gun recoil

you bade me ban and will you bid me leave
now by the ground that I am banish'd from
well could I curse away a winter's night
though standing naked on a mountain top
where biting cold would never let grass grow
and think it but a minute spent in sport

O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand
that I may dew it with my mournful tears
nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
to wash away my woeful monuments
O could this kiss be printed in thy hand

that thou mightst think upon these by the seal
through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee
so get thee gone that I may know my grief
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by
as one that surfeits thinking on a want
adventure to be banished myself
and banished I am if but from thee
go speak not to me even now be gone
O go not yet Even thus two friends condemn'd
embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
loather a hundred times to part than die
yet now farewell and farewell life with thee

thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished
once by the king and three times thrice by thee
'Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence
a wilderness is populous enough
so Suffolk had thy heavenly company
for where thou art there is the world itself
with every several pleasure in the world
and where thou art not desolation
I can no more live thou to joy thy life
myself to joy in nought but that thou liv'st

whither goes Vaux so fast what news I prithee

to signify unto his majesty
that Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death
for suddenly a grievous sickness took him
that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
blaspheming God and cursing men on earth
sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
were by his side sometime he calls the king
and whispers to his pillow as to him
the secrets of his overcharged soul
and I am sent to tell his majesty
that even now he cries aloud for him

go tell this heavy message to the king

ay me what is this world what news are these
but wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss
omitting Suffolk's exile my soul's treasure
and with the southern clouds contend in tears
theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows
now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming
if thou be found by me thou art but dead

if I depart from thee I cannot live
and in thy sight to die what were it else
but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
here could I breathe my soul into the air
as mild and gentle as the cradle babe
dying with mother's dug between its lips
where from thy sight I should be raging mad
and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
or I should breathe it so into thy body
and then it liv'd in sweet Elysium
to die by thee were but to die in jest
from thee to die were torture more than death

away though parting be a fretful corsive
it is applied to a deathful wound
to France sweet Suffolk let me hear from thee
for wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe
I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out

I go

and take my heart with thee

a jewel lock'd into the woefull'st cask
that ever did contain a thing of worth
even as a splitted bark so sunder we
this way fall I to death

this way for me



if thou be'st death I'll give thee England's treasure
enough to purchase such another island
so thou wilt let me live and feel no pain

Ah what a sign it is of evil life
where death's approach is seen so terrible

Beaufort it is thy sov'reign speaks to thee

bring me unto my trial when you will
died he not in his bed where should he die
can I make men live whe'r they will or no
O torture me no more I will confess
alive again then show me where he is
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him
he hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them
comb down his hair look look it stands upright
like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul
bring the strong poison that I bought of him

O thou eternal Mover of the heavens
look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
O beat away the busy meddling fiend
that lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul
and from his bosom purge this black despair

see how the pangs of death do make him grin

disturb him not let him pass peaceably

peace to his soul if God's good pleasure be
lord Cardinal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss
hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
he dies and makes no sign O God forgive him

so bad a death argues a monstrous life

close up his eyes and draw the curtain close
and let us all to meditation

the gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
is crept into the bosom of the sea
and now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
that drag the tragic melancholy night
who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
for whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs
here shall they make their ransom on the sand
or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore
master this prisoner freely give I thee
and thou that art his mate make boot of this
the other

, Walter Whitmore is thy share
what is my ransom master let me know

a thousand crowns or else lay down your head

and so much shall you give or off goes yours

what think you much to pay two thousand crowns
and bear the name and port of gentlemen
cut both the villains' throats for die you shall
the lives of those which we have lost in fight
cannot be counterpois'd with such a petty sum

I'll give it sir and therefore spare my life

and so will I and write home for it straight

I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard


and so should these if I might have my will

be not so rash take ransom let him live

look on my George I am a gentleman
rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid

and so am I my name is Walter Whitmore
how now why start'st thou what doth death affright

thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
a cunning man did calculate my birth
and told me that by Water I should die
yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded
thy name is Gaultier being rightly sounded

Gaultier or Walter which it is I care not
never yet did base dishonour blur our name
but with our sword we wip'd away the blot
broke be my sword my arms torn and defac'd
and I proclaim'd a coward through the world


stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
the Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole

the Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags

ay but these rags are no part of the duke
Jove sometimes went disguis'd and why not I

but Jove was never slain as thou shalt be

obscure and lowly swain King Henry's blood
the honourable blood of Lancaster
must not be shed by such a jaded groom
hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup
bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
how often hast thou waited at my cup
fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board
when I have feasted with Queen Margaret
remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n
ay and allay this thy abortive pride
how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
and duly waited for my coming forth
this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue

speak captain shall I stab the forlorn swain

first let my words stab him as he hath me

base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou

convey him hence and on our longboat's side
strike off his head


yes Pole

Pole

pool Sir Pool lord
ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
troubles the silver spring where England drinks
now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
for swallowing the treasure of the realm
thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground
and thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
against the senseless winds shall grin in vain
who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
and wedded be thou to the hags of hell
for daring to affy a mighty lord
unto the daughter of a worthless king
having neither subject wealth nor diadem
by devilish policy art thou grown great
with gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart
by thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France
the false revolting Normans thorough thee
disdain to call us lord and Picardy
hath slain their governors surpris'd our forts
and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
the princely Warwick and the Nevils all
whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
as hating thee are rising up in arms
and now the house of York thrust from the crown
by shameful murder of a guiltless king
and lofty proud encroaching tyranny
burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
advance our half-fac'd sun striving to shine
under the which is writ Invitis nubibus
the commons here in Kent are up in arms
and to conclude reproach and beggary
is crept into the palace of our king
and all by thee Away convey him hence
O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder
upon these paltry servile abject drudges
small things make base men proud this villain here
being captain of a pinnace threatens more
than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate
drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives
it is impossible that I should die
by such a lowly vassal as thyself
thy words move rage and not remorse in me
I go of message from the queen to France
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel

Walter

come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death

gelidus timor occupat artus tis thee I fear

thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee

my gracious lord entreat him speak him fair

Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough
us'd to command untaught to plead for favour
far be it we should honour such as these
with humble suit no rather let my head
stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
save to the God of heaven and to my king
and sooner dance upon a bloody pole
than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom
true nobility is exempt from fear
more can I bear than you dare execute

hale him away and let him talk no more

come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
that this my death may never be forgot
great men oft die by vile bezonians
murder'd sweet Tully Brutus' bastard hand
stabb'd Julius C sar savage islanders
Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates


and as for these whose ransom we have set
it is our pleasure one of them depart
therefore come you with us and let him go

there let his head and lifeless body lie
until the queen his mistress bury it


O barbarous and bloody spectacle
his body will I bear unto the king
if he revenge it not yet will his friends
so will the queen that living held him dear



they have the more need to sleep now then

I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth and turn it and set a new nap upon it

so he had need for tis threadbare Well I say it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up

O miserable age Virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men

the nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons

nay more the king's council are no good workmen

true and yet it is said Labour in thy vocation which is as much to say as let the magistrates be labouring men and therefore should we be magistrates

thou hast hit it for there's no better sign of a brave mind than a hard hand

I see them I see them There's Best's son the tanner of Wingham


and Dick the butcher

then is sin struck down like an ox and iniquity's throat cut like a calf

and Smith the weaver

argo their thread of life is spun

come come let's fall in with them


we John Cade so termed of our supposed father

or rather of stealing a cade of herrings

for our enemies shall fall before us inspired with the spirit of putting down kings and princes Command silence

silence
my father was a Mortimer

he was an honest man and a good bricklayer

my mother a Plantagenet

I knew her well she was a midwife

my wife descended of the Lacies

she was indeed a pedlar's daughter and sold many laces

but now of late not able to travel with her furred pack she washes bucks here at home

therefore am I of an honourable house

ay by my faith the field is honourable and there was he born under a hedge for his father had never a house but the cage

valiant I am
a' must needs for beggary is valiant

I am able to endure much

no question of that for I have seen him whipped three market-days together

I fear neither sword nor fire

he need not fear the sword for his coat is of proof

but methinks he should stand in fear of fire being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep

be brave then for your captain is brave and vows reformation There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny the three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony to drink small beer All the realm shall be in common and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass And when I am king as king I will be

God save your majesty

I thank you good people there shall be no money all shall eat and drink on my score and I will apparel them all in one livery that they may agree like brothers and worship me their lord

the first thing we do let's kill all the lawyers
nay that I mean to do Is not this a lamentable thing that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment that parchment being scribbled o'er should undo a man Some say the bee stings but I say tis the bee's wax for I did but seal once to a thing and I was never mine own man since How now who's there


the clerk of Chatham he can write and read and cast accompt

O monstrous

we took him setting of boys' copies

here's a villain

has a book in his pocket with red letters in't

nay then he is a conjurer

nay he can make obligations and write court-hand

I am sorry for't the man is a proper man of mine honour unless I find him guilty he shall not die Come hither sirrah I must examine thee What is thy name


they use to write it on the top of letters Twill go hard with you

let me alone Dost thou use to write thy name or hast thou a mark to thyself like an honest plain-dealing man

sir I thank God I have been so well brought up that I can write my name

he hath confessed away with him he's a villain and a traitor

away with him I say hang him with his pen and ink-horn about his neck

where's our general

here I am thou particular fellow

fly fly fly Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are hard by with the king's forces

stand villain stand or I'll fell thee down He shall be encountered with a man as good as himself he is but a knight is a'


to equal him I will make myself a knight presently

rise up Sir John Mortimer [Rises ] Now have at him


rebellious hinds the filth and scum of Kent
mark'd for the gallows lay your weapons down
home to your cottages forsake this groom
the king is merciful if you revolt

but angry wrathful and inclin'd to blood
if you go forward therefore yield or die

as for these silken-coated slaves I pass not
it is to you good people that I speak
o'er whom in time to come I hope to reign
for I am rightful heir unto the crown

and thou thyself a shearman art thou not

and Adam was a gardener

and what of that

marry this Edmund Mortimer Earl of March
married the Duke of Clarence' daughter did he not

ay sir

by her he had two children at one birth

that's false

ay there's the question but I say tis true
the elder of them being put to nurse
was by a beggar-woman stol'n away
and ignorant of his birth and parentage
his son am I deny it if you can

nay tis too true therefore he shall be king

sir he made a chimney in my father's house and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it therefore deny it not

and will you credit this base drudge's words
that speaks he knows not what

ay marry will we therefore get ye gone

Jack Cade the Duke of York hath taught you this

he lies for I invented it myself Go to sirrah tell the king from me that for his father's sake Henry the Fifth in whose time boys went to span-counter for French crowns I am content he shall reign but I'll be protector over him

and furthermore we'll have the Lord Say's head for selling the dukedom of Maine

and good reason for thereby is England mained and fain to go with a staff but that my puissance holds it up Fellow kings I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth and made it a eunuch and more than that he can speak French and therefore he is a traitor


nay answer if you can the Frenchmen are our enemies go to then I ask but this can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor or no

no no and therefore we'll have his head

well seeing gentle words will not prevail
assail them with the army of the king

herald away and throughout every town
proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade
that those which fly before the battle ends
may even in their wives' and children's sight
be hang'd up for example at their doors
and you that be the king's friends follow me


and you that love the commons follow me
now show yourselves men tis for liberty
we will not leave one lord one gentleman
for they are thrifty honest men and such
as would but that they dare not take our parts

they are all in order and march toward us

but then are we in order when we are most out of order Come march forward


where's Dick the butcher of Ashford

here sir

they fell before thee like sheep and oxen and thou behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter-house therefore thus will I reward thee the Lent shall be as long again as it is and thou shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking one

I desire no more

and to speak truth thou deservest no less This monument of the victory will I bear

and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels till I do come to London where we will have the Mayor's sword borne before us
if we mean to thrive and do good break open the gaols and let out the prisoners

fear not that I warrant thee Come let's march towards London


oft have I heard that grief softens the mind
and makes it fearful and degenerate
think therefore on revenge and cease to weep
but who can cease to weep and look on this
here may his head lie on my throbbing breast
but where's the body that I should embrace

what answer makes your Grace to the rebels' supplication

I'll send some holy bishop to entreat
for God forbid so many simple souls
should perish by the sword And I myself
rather than bloody war shall cut them short
will parley with Jack Cade their general

Ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face
rul'd like a wandering planet over me
and could it not enforce them to relent
that were unworthy to behold the same

lord Say Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head

ay but I hope your highness shall have his

how now madam
still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death
I fear me love if that I had been dead
thou wouldest not have mourn'd so much for me

no my love I should not mourn but die for thee


how now what news why com'st thou in such haste
the rebels are in Southwark fly my lord
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer
descended from the Duke of Clarence' house
and calls your Grace usurper openly
and vows to crown himself in Westminster
his army is a ragged multitude
of hinds and peasants rude and merciless
sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother's death
hath given them heart and courage to proceed
all scholars lawyers courtiers gentlemen
they call false caterpillars and intend their death

O graceless men they know not what they do

my gracious lord retire to Killingworth
until a power be rais'd to put them down

Ah were the Duke of Suffolk now alive
these Kentish rebels would be soon appeas'd
lord Say the traitors hate thee
therefore away with us to Killingworth

so might your Grace's person be in danger
the sight of me is odious in their eyes
and therefore in this city will I stay
and live alone as secret as I may


Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge
the citizens fly and forsake their houses
the rascal people thirsting after prey
join with the traitor and they jointly swear
to spoil the city and your royal court

then linger not my lord away take horse

come Margaret God our hope will succour us


farewell my lord trust not the Kentish rebels

trust nobody for fear you be betray'd

the trust I have is in mine innocence
and therefore am I bold and resolute


how now is Jack Cade slain

no my lord nor likely to be slain for they have won the bridge killing all those that withstand them The Lord Mayor craves aid of your honour from the Tower to defend the city from the rebels

such aid as I can spare you shall command
but I am troubled here with them myself
the rebels have assay'd to win the Tower
but get you to Smithfield and gather head
and thither I will send you Matthew Goffe
fight for your king your country and your lives


now is Mortimer lord of this city And here sitting upon London-stone I charge and command that of the city's cost the pissing-conduit run nothing but claret wine this first year of our reign And now henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls me other than Lord Mortimer


Jack Cade Jack Cade

knock him down there


if this fellow be wise he'll never call you Jack Cade more I think he hath a very fair warning

my lord there's an army gathered together in Smithfield

come then let's go fight with them But first go and set London-bridge on fire and if you can burn down the Tower too Come let's away


so sirs Now go some and pull down the Savoy others to the inns of court down with them all


be it a lordship thou shalt have it for that word

only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth

mass twill be sore law then for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear and tis not whole yet

nay John it will be stinking law for his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese

I have thought upon it it shall be so Away burn all the records of the realm my mouth shall be the parliament of England

then we are like to have biting statutes unless his teeth be pulled out

and henceforward all things shall be in common


my lord a prize a prize here's the Lord Say which sold the towns in France he that made us pay one-and-twenty fifteens and one shilling to the pound the last subsidy



what of that

marry thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a cloak when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets

and work in their shirt too as myself for example that am a butcher

you men of Kent

what say you of Kent

nothing but this tis bona terra mala gens

away with him away with him he speaks Latin

hear me but speak and bear me where you will
Kent in the Commentaries C sar writ
is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle
sweet is the country because full of riches
which makes me hope you are not void of pity
I sold not Maine I lost not Normandy
yet to recover them would lose my life
justice with favour have I always done
prayers and tears have mov'd me gifts could never
when have I aught exacted at your hands
but to maintain the king the realm and you
large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks
because my book preferr'd me to the king
and seeing ignorance is the curse of God
knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven
unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits
you cannot but forbear to murder me
this tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
for your behoof

tut when struck'st thou one blow in the field

great men have reaching hands oft have I struck

O monstrous coward what to come behind folks

these cheeks are pale for watching for your good

give him a box o' the ear and that will make em red again

long sitting to determine poor men's causes
hath made me full of sickness and diseases

ye shall have a hempen caudle then and the help of hatchet

why dost thou quiver man

the palsy and not fear provokes me

nay he nods at us as who should say I'll be even with you I'll see if his head will stand steadier on a pole or no Take him away and behead him

tell me wherein have I offended most
are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold
is my apparel sumptuous to behold
whom have I injur'd that ye seek my death
these hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding
this breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts
O let me live

I feel remorse in myself with his words but I'll bridle it he shall die an it be but for pleading so well for his life Away with him he has a familiar under his tongue he speaks not o' God's name Go take him away I say and strike off his head presently and then break into his son-in-law's house Sir James Cromer and strike off his head and bring them both upon two poles hither

it shall be done

Ah countrymen if when you make your prayers
God should be so obdurate as yourselves
how would it fare with your departed souls
and therefore yet relent and save my life

away with him and do as I command ye

the proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute there shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it men shall hold of me in capite and we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell
my lord when shall we go to Cheapside and take up commodities upon our bills

marry presently

O brave


but is not this braver Let them kiss one another for they loved well when they were alive Now part them again lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in France Soldiers defer the spoil of the city until night for with these borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the streets and at every corner have them kiss Away


up Fish Street down St Magnus' corner kill and knock down throw them into Thames [A parley sounded then a retreat ] What noise is this I hear Dare any be so bold to sound retreat or parley when I command them kill


ay here they be that dare and will disturb thee
know Cade we come ambassadors from the king
unto the commons whom thou hast misled
and here pronounce free pardon to them all
that will forsake thee and go home in peace

and yield to mercy whilst tis offer'd you
or let a rebel lead you to your deaths
who loves the king and will embrace his pardon
fling up his cap and say God save his majesty
who hateth him and honours not his father
Henry the Fifth that made all France to quake
shake he his weapon at us and pass by

God save the king God save the king

what Buckingham and Clifford are ye so brave And you base peasants do ye believe him will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks Hath my sword therefore broke through London Gates that you should leave me at the White Hart in Southwark I thought ye would never have given out these arms till you had recovered your ancient freedom but you are all recreants and dastards and delight to live in slavery to the nobility Let them break your backs with burdens take your houses over your heads ravish your wives and daughters before your faces for me I will make shift for one and so God's curse light upon you all

we'll follow Cade we'll follow Cade

is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth
that thus you do exclaim you'll go with him
will he conduct you through the heart of France
and make the meanest of you earls and dukes
alas he hath no home no place to fly to
unless by robbing of your friends and us
were't not a shame that whilst you live at jar
the fearful French whom you late vanquished
should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you
methinks already in this civil broil
I see them lording it in London streets
crying Villiago unto all they meet
better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry
than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy
to France to France and get what you have lost
spare England for it is your native coast
Henry hath money you are strong and manly
God on our side doubt not of victory

a Clifford a Clifford we'll follow the king and Clifford

was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to a hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me desolate I see them lay their heads together to surprise me My sword make way for me for here is no staying In despite of the devils and hell have through the very middest of you and heavens and honour be witness that no want of resolution in me but only my followers' base and ignominious treasons makes me betake me to my heels


and he that brings his head unto the king
shall have a thousand crowns for his reward

follow me soldiers we'll devise a mean
to reconcile you all unto the king


was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne
and could command no more content than I
no sooner was I crept out of my cradle
but I was made a king at nine months old
was never subject long'd to be a king
as I do long and wish to be a subject


health and glad tidings to your majesty

why Buckingham is the traitor Cade surpris'd
or is he but retir'd to make him strong

he's fled my lord and all his powers do yield
and humbly thus with halters on their necks
expect your highness' doom of life or death

then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates
to entertain my vows of thanks and praise
soldiers this day have you redeem'd your lives
and show'd how well you love your prince and country
continue still in this so good a mind
and Henry though he be infortunate
assure yourselves will never be unkind
and so with thanks and pardon to you all
I do dismiss you to your several countries

God save the king God save the king


please it your Grace to be advertised
and with a puissant and a mighty power
of Gallowglasses and stout kerns
is marching hitherward in proud array
and still proclaimeth as he comes along
his arms are only to remove from thee
the Duke of Somerset whom he terms a traitor

thus stands my state twixt Cade and York distress'd
like to a ship that having scap'd a tempest
is straight way calm'd and boarded with a pirate
but now is Cade driven back his men dispers'd
and now is York in arms to second him
I pray thee Buckingham go and meet him
and ask him what's the reason of these arms
tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower
and Somerset we will commit thee thither
until his army be dismiss'd from him

my lord
or unto death to do my country good

in any case be not too rough in terms
for he is fierce and cannot brook hard language

I will my lord and doubt not so to deal
as all things shall redound unto your good

come wife let's in and learn to govern better
for yet may England curse my wretched reign

fie on ambition fie on myself that have a sword and yet am ready to famish These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for all the country is laid for me but now I am so hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years I could stay no longer Wherefore on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden to see if I can eat grass or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather And I think this word sallet' was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time when I have been dry and bravely marching it hath served me instead of a quart-pot to drink in and now the word sallet' must serve me to feed on


lord who would live turmoiled in the court
and may enjoy such quiet walks as these
this small inheritance my father left me
contenteth me and worth a monarchy
I seek not to wax great by others' waning
sufficeth that I have maintains my state
and sends the poor well pleased from my gate

here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for entering his fee-simple without leave Ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part

why rude companion whatsoe'er thou be
I know thee not why then should I betray thee
is't not enough to break into my garden
and like a thief to come to rob my grounds
climbing my walls in spite of me the owner
but thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms

brave thee ay by the best blood that ever was broached and beard thee too Look on me well I have eat no meat these five days yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you all as dead as a door-nail I pray God I may never eat grass more

nay it shall ne'er be said while England stands
that Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent
took odds to combat a poor famish'd man
oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine
see if thou canst out-face me with thy looks
thy hand is but a finger to my fist
thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
and if mine arm be heaved in the air
thy grave is digg'd already in the earth
as for more words whose greatness answers words
let this my sword report what speech forbears

by my valour the most complete champion that ever I heard Steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath I beseech Jove on my knees thou mayst be turned to hobnails

O I am slain Famine and no other hath slain me let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the ten meals I have lost and I'll defy them all Wither garden and be henceforth a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled

is't Cade that I have slain that monstrous traitor
sword I will hallow thee for this thy deed
and hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead
ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point
but thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat
to emblaze the honour that thy master got



how much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge
die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
and as I thrust thy body in with my sword
so wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell
hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
and there cut off thy most ungracious head
which I will bear in triumph to the king
leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon


from Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
and pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head
ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright
to entertain great England's lawful king
Ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear
let them obey that know not how to rule
I cannot give due action to my words
except a sword or sceptre balance it
a sceptre shall it have have I-a soul
on which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France


whom have we here Buckingham to disturb me

the king hath sent him sure I must dissemble

York if thou meanest well I greet thee well

Humphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting
art thou a messenger or come of pleasure

a messenger from Henry our dread hege
to know the reason of these arms in peace
or why thou being a subject as I am
against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
or dare to bring thy force so near the court

scarce can I speak my choler is so great
O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint
I am so angry at these abject terms
and now like Ajax Telamonius
on sheep or oxen could I spend my fury
I am far better born than is the king
more like a king more kingly in my thoughts
but I must make fair weather yet awhile
till Henry be more weak and I more strong


Buckingham I prithee pardon me
that I have given no answer all this while
my mind was troubled with deep melancholy
the cause why I have brought this army hither
is to remove proud Somerset from the king
seditious to his Grace and to the state
that is too much presumption on thy part
but if thy arms be to no other end
the king hath yielded unto thy demand
the Duke of Somerset is in the Tower

upon thine honour is he a prisoner

upon mine honour he is a prisoner

then Buckingham I do dismiss my powers
soldiers I thank you all disperse yourselves
meet me to-morrow in Saint George's field
you shall have pay and everything you wish
and let my sov'reign virtuous Henry
command my eldest son nay all my sons
as pledges of my fealty and love
I'll send them all as willing as I live
lands goods horse armour anything I have
is his to use so Somerset may die
York I commend this kind submission
we twain will go into his highness' tent


Buckingham doth York intend no harm to us
that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm

in all submission and humility
York doth present himself unto your highness

then what intend these forces thou dost bring

to heave the traitor Somerset from hence
and fight against that monstrous rebel Cade
who since I heard to be discomfited


if one so rude and of so mean condition
may pass into the presence of a king
the head of Cade whom I in combat slew

the head of Cade Great God how just art thou
O let me view his visage being dead
that living wrought me such exceeding trouble
tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him

I was an't like your majesty

how art thou call'd and what is thy degree

Alexander Iden that's my name
a poor esquire of Kent that loves his king

so please it you my lord twere not amiss
he were created knight for his good service

Iden kneel down

we give thee for reward a thousand marks
and will that thou henceforth attend on us

may Iden live to merit such a bounty
and never live but true unto his liege

see Buckingham Somerset comes with the queen
go bid her hide him quickly from the duke


for thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head
but boldly stand and front him to his face

how now is Somerset at liberty
then York unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts
and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
shall I endure the sight of Somerset
false king why hast thou broken faith with me
knowing how hardly I can brook abuse
not fit to govern and rule multitudes
which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor
that head of thine doth not become a crown
thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff
and not to grace an awful princely sceptre
that gold must round engirt these brows of mine
whose smile and frown like to Achilles' spear
is able with the change to kill and cure
here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
and with the same to act controlling laws
give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more
o'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler

O monstrous traitor I arrest thee York
of capital treason gainst the king and crown
obey audacious traitor kneel for grace

wouldst have me kneel first let me ask of these
if they can brook I bow a knee to man

I know ere they will have me go to ward
they'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement

call hither Clifford bid him come amain
to say if that the bastard boys of York
shall be the surety for their traitor father


O blood-bespotted Neapolitan
outcast of Naples England's bloody scourge
the sons of York thy betters in their birth
shall be their father's bail and bane to those
that for my surety will refuse the boys


see where they come I'll warrant they'll make it good

and here comes Clifford to deny their bail
health and all happiness to my lord the king

I thank thee Clifford say what news with thee
nay do not fright us with an angry look
we are thy sov'reign Clifford kneel again
for thy mistaking so we pardon thee

this is my king York I do not mistake
but thou mistak'st me much to think I do
to Bedlam with him is the man grown mad

ay Clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour
makes him oppose himself against his king

he is a traitor let him to the Tower
and chop away that factious pate of his

he is arrested but will not obey
his sons he says shall give their words for him
will you not sons

ay noble father if our words will serve

and if words will not then our weapons shall

why what a brood of traitors have we here

look in a glass and call thy image so
I am thy king and thou a false-heart traitor
call hither to the stake my two brave bears
that with the very shaking of their chains
they may astonish these fell-lurking curs
bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me


are these thy bears we'll bait thy bears to death
and manacle the bear-ward in their chains
if thou dar'st bring them to the baiting-place
oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
run back and bite because he was withheld
who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw
hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried
and such a piece of service will you do
if you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick

hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
as crooked in thy manners as thy shape

nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon

take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves

why Warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
old Salisbury shame to thy silver hair
thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son
what wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian
and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
if it be banish'd from the frosty head
where shall it find a harbour in the earth
wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
and shame thine honourable age with blood
why art thou old and want'st experience
or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
for shame in duty bend thy knee to me
that bows unto the grave with mickle age

my lord I have consider'd with myself
the title of this most renowned duke
and in my conscience do repute his Grace
the rightful heir to England's royal seat

hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me

I have

canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
it is great sin to swear unto a sin
but greater sin to keep a sinful oath
who can be bound by any solemn vow
to do a murderous deed to rob a man
to force a spotless virgin's chastity
to reave the orphan of his patrimony
to wring the widow from her custom'd right
and have no other reason for this wrong
but that he was bound by a solemn oath

a subtle traitor needs no sophister

call Buckingham and bid him arm himself

call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast
I am resolv'd for death or dignity

the first I warrant thee if dreams prove true

to keep thee from the tempest of the field

I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm
than any thou canst conjure up to-day
and that I'll write upon thy burgonet
might I but know thee by thy household badge

now by my father's badge old Nevil's crest
the rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff
this day I'll wear aloft my burgonet
as on a mountain-top the cedar shows
that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
even to affright thee with the view thereof

and from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
and tread it underfoot with all contempt
despite the bear-ward that protects the bear

and so to arms victorious father

fie charity for shame speak not in spite
for you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night

foul stigmatic that's more than thou canst tell

if not in heaven you'll surely sup in hell


Clifford of Cumberland tis Warwick calls
and if thou dost not hide thee from the bear
now when the angry trumpet sounds alarm
and dead men's cries do fill the empty air
Clifford I say come forth and fight with me
proud northern lord Clifford of Cumberland
Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms

how now my noble lord what all afoot

but match to match I have encounter'd him
and made a prey for carrion kites and crows
even of the bonny beast he lov'd so well


of one or both of us the time is come

hold Warwick seek thee out some other chase
for I myself must hunt this deer to death

then nobly York tis for a crown thou fight'st
as I intend Clifford to thrive to-day
it grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd


what seest thou in me York why dost thou pause

with thy brave bearing should I be in love
but that thou art so fast mine enemy
nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
but that tis shown ignobly and in treason

so let it help me now against thy sword
as I in justice and true right express it

my soul and body on the action both

a dreadful lay address thee instantly

la fin couronne les uvres


thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still
peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will

shame and confusion all is on the rout
fear frames disorder and disorder wounds
where it should guard O war thou son of hell
throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
hot coals of vengeance Let no soldier fly
he that is truly dedicate to war
hath no self-love nor he that loves himself
hath not essentially but by circumstance
the name of valour

O let the vile world end
and the premised flames of the last day
knit heaven and earth together
now let the general trumpet blow his blast
particularities and petty sounds
to cease Wast thou ordain'd dear father
to lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
the silver livery of advised age
and in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus
to die in ruffian battle Even at this sight
my heart is turn'd to stone and while tis mine
it shall be stony York not our old men spares
shall be to me even as the dew to fire
and beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax
henceforth I will not have to do with pity
meet I an infant of the house of York
into as many gobbets will I cut it
as wild Medea young Absyrtus did
in cruelty will I seek out my fame
come thou new ruin of old Clifford's house

as did neas old Anchises bear
so bear I thee upon my manly shoulders
but then neas bare a living load
nothing so heavy as these woes of mine

so lie thou there
for underneath an alehouse' paltry sign
the Castle in Saint Alban's Somerset
hath made the wizard famous in his death
priests pray for enemies but princes kill

away my lord you are slow for shame away

can we outrun the heavens good Margaret stay

what are you made of you'll nor fight nor fly
now is it manhood wisdom and defence
to give the enemy way and to secure us
by what we can which can no more but fly

if you be ta'en we then should see the bottom
of all our fortunes but if we haply scape
as well we may if not through your neglect
we shall to London get where you are lov'd
and where this breach now in our fortunes made
may readily be stopp'd


I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly
but fly you must uncurable discomfit
reigns in the hearts of all our present parts
away for your relief and we will live
to see their day and them our fortune give
away my lord away


of Salisbury who can report of him
that winter lion who in rage forgets
aged contusions and all brush of time
and like a gallant in the brow of youth
repairs him with occasion this happy day
is not itself nor have we won one foot
if Salisbury be lost

my noble father
three times to-day I holp him to his horse
three times bestrid him thrice I led him off
but still where danger was still there I met him
and like rich hangings in a homely house
so was his will in his old feeble body
but noble as he is look where he comes


now by my sword well hast thou fought to-day
by the mass so did we all I thank you Richard
God knows how long it is I have to live
and it hath pleas'd him that three times to-day
you have defended me from imminent death
well lords we have not got that which we have
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled
being opposites of such repairing nature

I know our safety is to follow them

for as I hear the king is fled to London
to call a present court of parliament
what says Lord Warwick shall we after them

after them nay before them if we can
now by my hand lords twas a glorious day
Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
shall be eterniz'd in all age to come
sound drums and trumpets and to London all
and more such days as these to us befall

THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY VI

I wonder how the king escap'd our hands

while we pursu'd the horsemen of the north
he slily stole away and left his men
whereat the great Lord of Northumberland
whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
cheer'd up the drooping army and himself
lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast
were by the swords of common soldiers slain

lord Stafford's father Duke of Buckingham
is either slain or wounded dangerously
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow
that this is true father behold his blood


and brother here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood

whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd

speak thou for me and tell them what I did


Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons
but is your Grace dead my Lord of Somerset

such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt
thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head

and so do I Victorious Prince of York
before I see thee seated in that throne
which now the house of Lancaster usurps
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
this is the palace of the fearful king
and this the regal seat possess it York
for this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'

assist me then sweet Warwick and I will
for hither we have broken in by force

we'll all assist you he that flies shall die

thanks gentle Norfolk Stay by me my lords
and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night

and when the king comes offer him no violence


the queen this day here holds her parliament
but little thinks we shall be of her council
by words or blows here let us win our right

arm'd as we are let's stay within this house

the bloody parliament shall this be call'd
unless Plantagenet Duke of York be king
and bashful Henry depos'd whose cowardice
hath made us by-words to our enemies

then leave me not my lords be resolute
I mean to take possession of my right

neither the king nor he that loves him best
the proudest he that holds up Lancaster
dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells
resolve thee Richard claim the English crown


my lords look where the sturdy rebel sits
even in the chair of state belike he means
back'd by the power of Warwick that false peer
to aspire unto the crown and reign as king
Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father
and thine Lord Clifford and you both have vow'd revenge
on him his sons his favourites and his friends

if I be not heavens be reveng'd on me

the hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel

what shall we suffer this let's pluck him down
my heart for anger burns I cannot brook it

be patient gentle Earl of Westmoreland
patience is for poltroons such as he
he durst not sit there had your father liv'd
my gracious lord here in the parliament
let us assail the family of York

well hast thou spoken cousin be it so

Ah know you not the city favours them
and they have troops of soldiers at their beck

but when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly

far be the thought of this from Henry's heart
to make a shambles of the parliament-house
cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats
shall be the war that Henry means to use

thou factious Duke of York descend my throne
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet

I am thine

for shame come down he made thee Duke of York

'Twas my inheritance as the earldom was

thy father was a traitor to the crown

Exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
in following this usurping Henry

whom should he follow but his natural king

true Clifford and that's Richard Duke of York

and shall I stand and thou sit in my throne

it must and shall be so content thyself
be Duke of Lancaster let him be king

he is both king and Duke of Lancaster
and that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain

and Warwick shall disprove it You forget
that we are those which chas'd you from the field
and slew your fathers and with colours spread
march'd through the city to the palace gates

yes Warwick I remember it to my grief
and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it

Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
thy kinsmen and thy friends I'll have more lives
than drops of blood were in my father's veins

urge it no more lest that instead of words
I send thee Warwick such a messenger

poor Clifford how I scorn his worthless threats

will you we show our title to the crown
if not our swords shall plead it in the field

what title hast thou traitor to the crown
thy father was as thou art Duke of York
thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March
I am the son of Henry the Fifth
who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
and seiz'd upon their towns and provinces

talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all

the Lord Protector lost it and not I
when I was crown'd I was but nine months old

you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose

sweet father do so set it on your head

good brother as thou lov'st and honour'st arms
let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus

sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly

sons peace

peace thou and give King Henry leave to speak

Plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords
and be you silent and attentive too
for he that interrupts him shall not live

think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne
wherein my grandsire and my father sat
no first shall war unpeople this my realm
and now in England to our heart's great sorrow
shall be my winding-sheet Why faint you lords
my title's good and better far than his

prove it Henry and thou shalt be king

Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown

'Twas by rebellion against his king

I know not what to say my title's weak


tell me may not a king adopt an heir

what then

an if he may then am I lawful king
for Richard in the view of many lords
whose heir my father was and I am his

he rose against him being his sovereign
and made him to resign his crown perforce

suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd
think you twere prejudicial to his crown

no for he could not so resign his crown
but that the next heir should succeed and reign

art thou against us Duke of Exeter

his is the right and therefore pardon me

why whisper you my lords and answer not

my conscience tells me he is lawful king


Plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st
think not that Henry shall be so depos'd

depos'd he shall be in despite of all

thou art deceiv'd tis not thy southern power
of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent
which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
can set the duke up in despite of me

king Henry be thy title right or wrong
lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence
may that ground gape and swallow me alive
where I shall kneel to him that slew my father

O Clifford how thy words revive my heart

Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown

do right unto this princely Duke of York
or I will fill the house with armed men
and o'er the chair of state where now he sits
write up his title with usurping blood


my Lord of Warwick hear me but one word
let me for this my life-time reign as king

confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st

I am content Richard Plantagenet
enjoy the kingdom after my decease

what wrong is this unto the prince your son

what good is this to England and himself
base fearful and despairing Henry

how hast thou injur'd both thyself and us

I cannot stay to hear these articles

nor I

come cousin let us tell the queen these news

farewell faint-hearted and degenerate king
in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides

be thou a prey unto the house of York
and die in bands for this unmanly deed

in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
or live in peace abandon'd and despis'd

turn this way Henry and regard them not

they seek revenge and therefore will not yield

Ah Exeter

why should you sigh my lord

not for myself Lord Warwick but my son
whom I unnaturally shall disinherit
but be it as it may I here entail
the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
conditionally that here thou take an oath
to cease this civil war and whilst I live
to honour me as thy king and sovereign
and neither by treason nor hostility
to seek to put me down and reign thyself

this oath I willingly take and will perform

long live King Henry Plantagenet embrace him

and long live thou and these thy forward sons

now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd

accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes


farewell my gracious lord I'll to my castle

and I'll keep London with my soldiers

and I to Norfolk with my followers

and I unto the sea from whence I came




here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger
I'll steal away


Exeter so will I


nay go not from me I will follow thee

be patient gentle queen and I will stay

who can be patient in such extremes
Ah wretched man would I had died a maid
and never seen thee never borne thee son
seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father
hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus
hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I
or nourish'd him as I did with my blood
thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there
rather than have made that savage duke thine heir
and disinherited thine only son

father you cannot disinherit me
if you be king why should not I succeed

pardon me Margaret pardon me sweet son
the Earl of Warwick and the duke enforc'd me

enforc'd thee art thou king and wilt be forc'd
I shame to hear thee speak Ah timorous wretch
thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
and given unto the house of York such head
as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown
what is it but to make thy sepulchre
and creep into it far before thy time
stern Faulconbridge commands the narrow seas
the duke is made protector of the realm
and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
the trembling lamb environed with wolves
had I been there which am a silly woman
the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
before I would have granted to that act
but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour
and seeing thou dost I here divorce myself
both from thy table Henry and thy bed
until that act of parliament be repeal'd
whereby my son is disinherited
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
will follow mine if once they see them spread
and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
and utter ruin of the house of York
thus do I leave thee Come son let's away
our army is ready come we'll after them


thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone

gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me

ay to be murder'd by his enemies

when I return with victory from the field
I'll see your Grace till then I'll follow her

come son away we may not linger thus


poor queen how love to me and to her son
hath made her break out into terms of rage
reveng'd may she be on that hateful duke
whose haughty spirit winged with desire
will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
tire on the flesh of me and of my son
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair
come cousin you shall be the messenger

and I I hope shall reconcile them all


brother though I be youngest give me leave

no I can better play the orator

but I have reasons strong and forcible


why how now sons and brother at a strife
what is your quarrel how began it first

no quarrel but a slight contention

about what
about that which concerns your Grace and us
the crown of England father which is yours

mine boy not till King Henry be dead

your right depends not on his life or death

now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
by giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe
it will outrun you father in the end

I took an oath that he should quietly reign

but for a kingdom any oath may be broken
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year

no God forbid your Grace should be forsworn

I shall be if I claim by open war
I'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak

thou canst not son it is impossible

an oath is of no moment being not took
before a true and lawful magistrate
that hath authority over him that swears
Henry had none but did usurp the place
then seeing twas he that made you to depose
your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
therefore to arms And father do but think
how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
within whose circuit is Elysium
and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
why do we linger thus I cannot rest
until the white rose that I wear be dy'd
even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart

Richard enough I will be king or die
and whet on Warwick to this enterprise
thou Richard shalt unto the Duke of Norfolk
and tell him privily of our intent
you Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham
with whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise
in them I trust for they are soldiers
witty courteous liberal full of spirit
while you are thus employ'd what resteth more
but that I seek occasion how to rise
and yet the king not privy to my drift
nor any of the house of Lancaster

but stay what news why com'st thou in such post

the queen with all the northern earls and lords
intend here to besiege you in your castle
she is hard by with twenty thousand men
and therefore fortify your hold my lord

Edward and Richard you shall stay with me
my brother Montague shall post to London
let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest
whom we have left protectors of the king
with powerful policy strengthen themselves
and trust not simple Henry nor his oaths

brother I go I'll win them fear it not
and thus most humbly I do take my leave

sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles
you are come to Sandal in a happy hour
the army of the queen mean to besiege us

she shall not need we'll meet her in the field

what with five thousand men

ay with five hundred father for a need


I hear their drums let's set our men in order
and issue forth and bid them battle straight

five men to twenty though the odds be great
I doubt not uncle of our victory
many a battle have I won in France
when as the enemy hath been ten to one
why should I not now have the like success


Ah whither shall I fly to scape their hands
Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes


chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life
as for the brat of this accursed duke
whose father slew my father he shall die
and I my lord will bear him company

soldiers away with him

Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child
lest thou be hated both of God and man


how now is he dead already Or is it fear
that makes him close his eyes I'll open them

so looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
that trembles under his devouring paws
and so he walks insulting o'er his prey
and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword
and not with such a cruel threatening look
sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath

in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood
hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter

then let my father's blood open it again
he is a man and Clifford cope with him

had I thy brethren here their lives and thine
were not revenge sufficient for me
no if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
and hung their rotten coffins up in chains
it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
the sight of any of the house of York
is as a fury to torment my soul
and till I root out their accursed line
and leave not one alive I live in hell
therefore


to thee I pray sweet Clifford pity me

such pity as my rapier's point affords

I never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me

thy father hath

but twas ere I was born
thou hast one son for his sake pity me
lest in revenge thereof sith God is just
he be as miserably slain as I
Ah let me live in prison all my days
and when I give occasion of offence
then let me die for now thou hast no cause

no cause
thy father slew my father therefore die

dii faciant laudis summa sit ista tu


Plantagenet I come Plantagenet
and this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both


the army of the queen hath got the field
my uncles both are slain in rescuing me
and all my followers to the eager foe
turn back and fly like ships before the wind
or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves
my sons God knows what hath bechanced them
but this I know they have demean'd themselves
like men born to renown by life or death
three times did Richard make a lane to me
and thrice cried Courage father fight it out
with purple falchion painted to the hilt
in blood of those that had encounter'd him
and when the hardiest warriors did retire
Richard cried Charge and give no foot of ground
and cried A crown or else a glorious tomb
a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre
with this we charg'd again but out alas
we bodg'd again as I have seen a swan
with bootless labour swim against the tide
and spend her strength with over-matching waves

Ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
and I am faint and cannot fly their fury
and were I strong I would not shun their fury
the sands are number'd that make up my life
here must I stay and here my life must end


come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland

I am your butt and I abide your shot

yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet

ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
with downright payment show'd unto my father
now Ph thon hath tumbled from his car
and made an evening at the noontide prick

my ashes as the ph nix may bring forth
a bird that will revenge upon you all
and in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven
scorning whate'er you can afflict me with
why come you not what multitudes and fear

so cowards fight when they can fly no further
so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons
so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives

O Clifford but bethink thee once again
and in thy thought o'er-run my former time
and if thou canst for blushing view this face
and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this

I will not bandy with thee word for word
but buckle with thee blows twice two for one


hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life
wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland

hold Clifford do not honour him so much
to prick thy finger though to wound his heart
what valour were it when a cur doth grin
for one to thrust his hand between his teeth
it is war's prize to take all vantages
and ten to one is no impeach of valour


ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin

so doth the cony struggle in the net


so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty
so true men yield with robbers so o'er-matched

what would your Grace have done unto him now

brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland
come make him stand upon this molehill here
that raught at mountains with outstretched arms
yet parted but the shadow with his hand
what was it you that would be England's king
and made a preachment of your high descent
where are your mess of sons to back you now
the wanton Edward and the lusty George
and where's that valiant crook-back prodigy
dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
or with the rest where is your darling Rutland
look York I stain'd this napkin with the blood
that valiant Clifford with his rapier's point
made issue from the bosom of the boy
and if thine eyes can water for his death
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly
I should lament thy miserable state
I prithee grieve to make me merry York
what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
that not a tear can fall for Rutland's death
why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
and I to make thee mad do mock thee thus
thou wouldst be fee'd I see to make me sport
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown
a crown for York and lords bow low to him
hold you his hands whilst I do set it on

ay marry sir now looks he like a king
ay this is he that took King Henry's chair
and this is he was his adopted heir
but how is it that great Plantagenet
is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath
as I bethink me you should not be king
till our King Henry had shook hands with death
and will you pale your head in Henry's glory
and rob his temples of the diadem
now in his life against your holy oath
O tis a fault too-too unpardonable
off with the crown and with the crown his head
and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead


nay stay let's hear the orisons he makes

she-wolf of France but worse than wolves of France
whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth
how ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
to triumph like an Amazonian trull
upon their woes whom fortune captivates
but that thy face is visor-like unchanging
made impudent with use of evil deeds
I would assay proud queen to make thee blush
to tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom deriv'd
were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
thy father bears the type of King of Naples
of both the Sicils and Jerusalem
yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
unless the adage must be verified
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
but God he knows thy share thereof is small
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd
the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at
'Tis government that makes them seem divine
the want thereof makes thee abominable
thou art as opposite to every good
as the Antipodes are unto us
or as the south to the septentrion
O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide
how couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child
to bid the father wipe his eyes withal
and yet be seen to bear a woman's face
women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
bidd'st thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish
wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will
for raging wind blows up incessant showers
and when the rage allays the rain begins
and every drop cries vengeance for his death
'Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman

beshrew me but his passion moves me so
that hardly can I check my eyes from tears

that face of his the hungry cannibals
would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood
but you are more inhuman more inexorable
O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania
see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears
this cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy
and I with tears do wash the blood away
keep thou the napkin and go boast of this

and if thou tell'st the heavy story right
upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears
and say Alas it was a piteous deed
and in thy need such comfort come to thee
as now I reap at thy too cruel hand
hard-hearted Clifford take me from the world
my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads

had he been slaughter-man to all my kin
I should not for my life but weep with him
to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul

what weeping-ripe my Lord Northumberland
think but upon the wrong he did us all
and that will quickly dry thy melting tears

here's for my oath here's for my father's death


and here's to right our gentlehearted king


my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee


off with his head and set it on York gates
so York may overlook the town of York

I wonder how our princely father scap'd
or whether he be scap'd away or no
from Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit
had he been ta'en we should have heard the news
had he been slain we should have heard the news
or had he scap'd methinks we should have heard
the happy tidings of his good escape
how fares my brother why is he so sad

I cannot joy until I be resolv'd
where our right valiant father is become
I saw him in the battle range about
and watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth
as doth a lion in a herd of neat
or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs
who having pinch'd a few and made them cry
the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
so far'd our father with his enemies
so fled his enemies my war-like father
methinks tis prize enough to be his son
see how the morning opes her golden gates
and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
how well resembles it the prime of youth
trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love

dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns

three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
not separated with the racking clouds
but sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky
see see they join embrace and seem to kiss
as if they vow'd some league inviolable
in this the heaven figures some event

'Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
I think it cites us brother to the field
that we the sons of brave Plantagenet
each one already blazing by our meeds
should notwithstanding join our lights together
and over-shine the earth as this the world
whate'er it bodes henceforward will I bear
upon my target three fair-shining suns

nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it
you love the breeder better than the male


but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell

some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue

when as the noble Duke of York was slain
your princely father and my loving lord

O speak no more for I have heard too much

say how he died for I will hear it all

environed he was with many foes
and stood against them as the hope of Troy
against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy
but Hercules himself must yield to odds
and many strokes though with a little axe
hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak
by many hands your father was subdu'd
but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
of unrelenting Clifford and the queen
who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite
laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept
the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain
and after many scorns many foul taunts
they took his head and on the gates of York
they set the same and there it doth remain
the saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd

sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon
now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
O Clifford boist'rous Clifford thou hast slain
the flower of Europe for his chivalry
and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee
now my soul's palace is become a prison
Ah would she break from hence that this my body
might in the ground be closed up in rest
for never henceforth shall I joy again
never O never shall I see more joy

I cannot weep for all my body's moisture
nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden
for self-same wind that I should speak withal
is kindling coals that fire all my breast
and burn me up with flames that tears would quench
to weep is to make less the depth of grief
tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
Richard I bear thy name I'll venge thy death
or die renowned by attempting it

his name that valiant duke hath left with thee
his dukedom and his chair with me is left

nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird
show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun
for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
either that is thine or else thou wert not his


how now fair lords What fare what news abroad
great Lord of Warwick if we should recount
our baleful news and at each word's deliv'rance
stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
the words would add more anguish than the wounds
O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain

O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet
which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption
is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death

ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears
and now to add more measure to your woes
I come to tell you things sith then befallen
after the bloody fray at Wakefield fought
where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp
tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
were brought me of your loss and his depart
I then in London keeper of the king
muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends
march'd towards Saint Alban's to intercept the queen
bearing the king in my behalf along
for by my scouts I was advertised
that she was coming with a full intent
to dash our late decree in parliament
touching King Henry's oath and your succession
short tale to make we at Saint Alban's met
our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought
but whether twas the coldness of the king
who look'd full gently on his war-like queen
that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen
or whether twas report of her success
or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour
who thunders to his captives blood and death
I cannot judge but to conclude with truth
their weapons like to lightning came and went
our soldiers' like the night-owl's lazy flight
or like a lazy thresher with a flail
fell gently down as if they struck their friends
with promise of high pay and great rewards
but all in vain they had no heart to fight
and we in them no hope to win the day
so that we fled the king unto the queen
lord George your brother Norfolk and myself
in haste post-haste are come to join with you
for in the marches here we heard you were
making another head to fight again

where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick
and when came George from Burgundy to England

some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
and for your brother he was lately sent
from your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy
with aid of soldiers to this needful war

'Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled
oft have I heard his praises in pursuit

nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear
for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head
and wring the awful sceptre from his fist
were he as famous and as bold in war
as he is fam'd for mildness peace and prayer

I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak
but in this troublous time what's to be done
shall we go throw away our coats of steel
and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
numb'ring our Ave-Maries with our beads
or shall we on the helmets of our foes
tell our devotion with revengeful arms
if for the last say Ay and to it lords

why therefore Warwick came to seek you out
attend me lords The proud insulting queen
with Clifford and the haught Northumberland
and of their feather many more proud birds
have wrought the easy-melting king like wax
he swore consent to your succession
his oath enrolled in the parliament
and now to London all the crew are gone
to frustrate both his oath and what beside
may make against the house of Lancaster
their power I think is thirty thousand strong
now if the help of Norfolk and myself
with all the friends that thou brave Earl of March
amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure
will but amount to five and twenty thousand
why Via to London will we march amain
and once again bestride our foaming steeds
and once again cry Charge upon our foes
but never once again turn back and fly

ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
that cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay

lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean
and when thou fail'st as God forbid the hour
must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend

no longer Earl of March but Duke of York
the next degree is England's royal throne
for King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
in every borough as we pass along
and he that throws not up his cap for joy
shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
king Edward valiant Richard Montague
stay we no longer dreaming of renown
but sound the trumpets and about our task

then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds

then strike up drums God and Saint George for us


how now what news

the Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
the queen is coming with a puissant host
and craves your company for speedy counsel

why then it sorts brave warriors let's away

welcome my lord to this brave town of York
yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
that sought to be encompass'd with your crown
doth not the object cheer your heart my lord

ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack
to see this sight it irks my very soul
nor wittingly have I infring'd my vow

my gracious liege this too much lenity
and harmful pity must be laid aside
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
not to the beast that would usurp their den
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
not his that spoils her young before her face
who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting
not he that sets his foot upon her back
the smallest worm will turn being trodden on
and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
ambitious York did level at thy crown
thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
he but a duke would have his son a king
and raise his issue like a loving sire
thou being a king bless'd with a goodly son
didst yield consent to disinherit him
which argu'd thee a most unloving father
and though man's face be fearful to their eyes
yet in protection of their tender ones
who hath not seen them even with those wings
which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight
make war with him that climb'd unto their nest
offering their own lives in their young's defence
for shame my liege make them your precedent
were it not pity that this goodly boy
should lose his birthright by his father's fault
and long hereafter say unto his child
'What my great grandfather and grandsire got
my careless father fondly gave away
Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy
and let his manly face which promiseth
successful fortune steel thy melting heart
to hold thine own and leave thine own with him

full well hath Clifford play'd the orator
inferring arguments of mighty force
that things ill got had ever bad success
and happy always was it for that son
whose father for his hoarding went to hell
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
and would my father had left me no more
for all the rest is held at such a rate
as brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
than in possession any jot of pleasure
Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know
how it doth grieve me that thy head is here

my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
and this soft courage makes your followers faint
you promis'd knighthood to our forward son
unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
Edward kneel down

Edward Plantagenet arise a knight
and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
my gracious father by your kingly leave
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown
and in that quarrel use it to the death

why that is spoken like a toward prince


royal commanders be in readiness
for with a band of thirty thousand men
comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York
and in the towns as they do march along
proclaims him king and many fly to him
darraign your battle for they are at hand

I would your highness would depart the field
the queen hath best success when you are absent

ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune


be it with resolution then to fight

my royal father cheer these noble lords
and hearten those that fight in your defence
unsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George


now perjur'd Henry wilt thou kneel for grace
and set thy diadem upon my head
or bide the mortal fortune of the field

go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
before thy sovereign and thy lawful king

I am his king and he should bow his knee
I was adopted heir by his consent
since when his oath is broke for as I hear
have caus'd him by new act of parliament
to blot out me and put his own son in

and reason too
who should succeed the father but the son

are you there butcher O I cannot speak

ay crook-back here I stand to answer thee
or any he the proudest of thy sort

'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland was it not

ay and old York and yet not satisfied

for God's sake lords give signal to the fight

what sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown

when you and I met at Saint Alban's last
your legs did better service than your hands

then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine

you said so much before and yet you fled

'Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence

no nor your manhood that durst make you stay

Northumberland I hold thee reverently
break off the parley for scarce I can refrain
the execution of my big-swoln heart
upon that Clifford that cruel child-killer

I slew thy father call'st thou him a child

ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
but ere sun-set I'll make thee curse the deed

have done with words my lords and hear me speak

defy them then or else hold close thy lips

I prithee give no limits to my tongue
I am a king and privileg'd to speak

my liege the wound that bred this meeting here
cannot be cur'd by words therefore be still

then executioner unsheathe thy sword
by him that made us all I am resolv'd
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue

say Henry shall I have my right or no
a thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
if thou deny their blood upon thy head
for York in justice puts his armour on

if that be right which Warwick says is right
there is no wrong but everything is right

whoever got thee there thy mother stands
for well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue

but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
but like a foul misshapen stigmatic
mark'd by the destinies to be avoided
as venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings

iron of Naples hid with English gilt
whose father bears the title of a king
as if a channel should be call'd the sea
sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
to let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart
a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
to make this shameless callet know herself
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou
although thy husband may be Menelaus
and ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
by that false woman as this king by thee
his father revell'd in the heart of France
and tam'd the king and made the Dauphin stoop
and had he match'd according to his state
he might have kept that glory to this day
but when he took a beggar to his bed
and grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day
even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him
that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France
and heap'd sedition on his crown at home
for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride
hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
and we in pity of the gentle king
had slipp'd our claim until another age
but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
and that thy summer bred us no increase
we set the axe to thy usurping root
and though the edge hath something hit ourselves
yet know thou since we have begun to strike
we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down
or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods

and in this resolution I defy thee
not willing any longer conference
since thou deny'st the gentle king to speak
sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
and either victory or else a grave

stay Edward

no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay
these words will cost ten thousand lives this day

forspent with toil as runners with a race
I lay me down a little while to breathe
for strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength
and spite of spite needs must I rest a while


smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
for this world frowns and Edward's sun is clouded

how now my lord what hap what hope of good


our hap is loss our hope but sad despair
our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
what counsel give you whither shall we fly

bootless is flight they follow us with wings
and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit

Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance
and in the very pangs of death he cried
like to a dismal clangor heard from far
'Warwick revenge brother revenge my death
so underneath the belly of their steeds
that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood
the noble gentleman gave up the ghost

then let the earth be drunken with our blood
I'll kill my horse because I will not fly
why stand we like soft-hearted women here
wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
and look upon as if the tragedy
were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors
here on my knee I vow to God above
I'll never pause again never stand still
of fortune given me measure of revenge

O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine
and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
thou setter up and plucker down of kings
beseeching thee if with thy will it stands
that to my foes this body must be prey
yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
now lords take leave until we meet again
where'er it be in heaven or in earth

brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick
let me embrace thee in my weary arms
I that did never weep now melt with woe
that winter should cut off our spring-time so


yet let us all together to our troops
and give them leave to fly that will not stay
and call them pillars that will stand to us
and if we thrive promise them such rewards
as victors wear at the Olympian games
this may plant courage in their quailing breasts
for yet is hope of life and victory
forslow no longer make we hence amain


now Clifford I have singled thee alone
suppose this arm is for the Duke of York
and this for Rutland both bound to revenge
wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall

now Richard I am with thee here alone
this is the hand that stabb'd thy father York
and this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland
and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
to execute the like upon thyself
and so have at thee


nay Warwick single out some other chase
for I myself will hunt this wolf to death


this battle fares like to the morning's war
when dying clouds contend with growing light
what time the shepherd blowing of his nails
can neither call it perfect day nor night
now sways it this way like a mighty sea
forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind
now sways it that way like the self-same sea
forc'd to retire by fury of the wind
sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
now one the better then another best
yet neither conqueror nor conquered
so is the equal poise of this fell war
here on this molehill will I sit me down
to whom God will there be the victory
for Margaret my queen and Clifford too
have chid me from the battle swearing both
they prosper best of all when I am thence
would I were dead if God's good will were so
for what is in this world but grief and woe
O God methinks it were a happy life
to be no better than a homely swain
to sit upon a hill as I do now
to carve out dials quaintly point by point
thereby to see the minutes how they run
how many make the hour full complete
how many hours bring about the day
how many days will finish up the year
how many years a mortal man may live
when this is known then to divide the times
so many hours must I take my rest
so many hours must I contemplate
so many hours must I sport myself
so many days my ewes have been with young
so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
so many years ere I shall shear the fleece
so minutes hours days months and years
pass'd over to the end they were created
would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
Ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
to shepherds looking on their silly sheep
than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
to kings that fear their subjects' treachery
O yes it doth a thousand-fold it doth
and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds
his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade
all which secure and sweetly he enjoys
his viands sparkling in a golden cup
his body couched in a curious bed
when care mistrust and treason wait on him


ill blows the wind that profits nobody
this man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
may be possessed with some store of crowns
and I that haply take them from him now
may yet ere night yield both my life and them
to some man else as this dead man doth me
who's this O God it is my father's face
whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd
O heavy times begetting such events
from London by the king was I press'd forth
my father being the Earl of Warwick's man
came on the part of York press'd by his master
and I who at his hands receiv'd my life
have by my hands of life bereaved him
and pardon father for I knew not thee
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
and no more words till they have flow'd their fill

O piteous spectacle O bloody times
whiles lions war and battle for their dens
poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
weep wretched man I'll aid thee tear for tear
and let our hearts and eyes like civil war
be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief


thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
for I have bought it with a hundred blows
but let me see is this our foeman's face
Ah no no no it is mine only son
Ah boy if any life be left in thee
throw up thine eye see see what showers arise
upon thy wounds that kill mine eye and heart
O pity God this miserable age
what stratagems how fell how butcherly
erroneous mutinous and unnatural
this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
O boy thy father gave thee life too soon
and hath bereft thee of thy life too late

woe above woe grief more than common grief
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
O pity pity gentle heaven pity
the red rose and the white are on his face
the fatal colours of our striving houses
the one his purple blood right well resembles
the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
wither one rose and let the other flourish
if you contend a thousand lives must wither

how will my mother for a father's death

how will my wife for slaughter of my son
shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied

how will the country for these woeful chances
misthink the king and not be satisfied

was ever son so ru'd a father's death

was ever father so bemoan'd a son

was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe
much is your sorrow mine ten times so much

I'll bear thee hence where I may weep my fill


these arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet
my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
and so obsequious will thy father be
e'en for the loss of thee having no more
as Priam was for all his valiant sons
I'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will
for I have murder'd where I should not kill


sad-hearted men much overgone with care
here sits a king more woeful than you are


fly father fly for all your friends are fled
and Warwick rages like a chafed bull
away for death doth hold us in pursuit

mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain
Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds
having the fearful flying hare in sight
and bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands
are at our backs and therefore hence amain

away for vengeance comes along with them
nay stay not to expostulate make speed
or else come after I'll away before

nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter
not that I fear to stay but love to go
whither the queen intends Forward away


here burns my candle out ay here it dies
which while it lasted gave King Henry light
O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow
more than my body's parting with my soul
my love and fear glu'd many friends to thee
and now I fall thy tough commixtures melt
impairing Henry strengthening misproud York
and whither fly the gnats but to the sun
and who shines now but Henry's enemies
O Ph bus hadst thou never given consent
that Ph thon should check thy fiery steeds
thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth
and Henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do
or as thy father and his father did
giving no ground unto the house of York
they never then had sprung like summer flies
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
had left no mourning widows for our death
and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
the foe is merciless and will not pity
for at their hands I have deserv'd no pity
the air hath got into my deadly wounds
come York and Richard Warwick and the rest
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms split my breast

now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause
and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen
that led calm Henry though he were a king
as doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust
command an argosy to stern the waves
but think you lords that Clifford fled with them

no tis impossible he should escape
for though before his face I speak the words
your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave
and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead


whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave


see who it is and now the battle's ended
if friend or foe let him be gently us'd

revoke that doom of mercy for tis Clifford
who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
in hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth
but set his murd'ring knife unto the root
from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
I mean our princely father Duke of York

from off the gates of York fetch down the head
your father's head which Clifford placed there
instead whereof let this supply the room
measure for measure must be answered

bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house
that nothing sung but death to us and ours
now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound


I think his understanding is bereft
speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life
and he nor sees nor hears us what we say

O would he did and so perhaps he doth
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit
because he would avoid such bitter taunts
which in the time of death he gave our father

if so thou think'st vex him with eager words

Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace

Clifford repent in bootless penitence

Clifford devise excuses for thy faults
while we devise fell tortures for thy faults

thou didst love York and I am son to York

thou pitiedst Rutland I will pity thee

where's Captain Margaret to fence you now

they mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wont

what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
when Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
I know by that he's dead and by my soul
if this right hand would buy two hours' life
that I in all despite might rail at him
this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood
stifle the villain whose unstaunched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy

and rear it in the place your father's stands
and now to London with triumphant march
there to be crowned England's royal king
from whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France
and ask the Lady Bona for thy queen
so shalt thou sinew both these lands together
and having France thy friend thou shalt not dread
the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again
for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
first will I see the coronation
and then to Brittany I'll cross the sea
to effect this marriage so it please my lord

even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be
for on thy shoulder do I build my seat
and never will I undertake the thing
wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester
shall do and undo as him pleaseth best

let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester
for Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous

tut that's a foolish observation
Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London
to see these honours in possession

under this thick-grown hrake we'll shroud ourselves
for through this laund anon the deer will come
and in this covert will we make our stand
culling the principal of all the deer

I'll stay above the hill so both may shoot

that cannot be the noise of thy cross-bow
will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
here stand we both and aim we at the best
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
in this self place where now we mean to stand

here comes a man let's stay till he be past


from Scotland am I stol'n even of pure love
to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
no Harry Harry tis no land of thine
thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee
thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed
no bending knee will call thee C sar now
no humble suitors press to speak for right
no not a man comes for redress of thee
for how can I help them and not myself

ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee
this is the quondam king let's seize upon him

for wise men say it is the wisest course

why linger we let us lay hands upon him

forbear awhile we'll hear a little more

my queen and son are gone to France for aid
and as I hear the great commanding Warwick
is thither gone to crave the French king's sister
to wife for Edward If this news be true
poor queen and son your labour is but lost
for Warwick is a subtle orator
and Lewis a prince soon won with moving words
by this account then Margaret may win him
for she's a woman to be pitied much
her sighs will make a battery in his breast
her tears will pierce into a marble heart
the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
and Nero will be tainted with remorse
ay but she's come to beg Warwick to give
she on his left side craving aid for Henry
he on his right asking a wife for Edward
she weeps and says her Henry is depos'd
he smiles and says his Edward is install'd
that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
inferreth arguments of mighty strength
and in conclusion wins the king from her
with promise of his sister and what else
to strengthen and support King Edward's place
O Margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn

say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens

more than I seem and less than I was born to
a man at least for less I should not be
and men may talk of kings and why not I
ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king

why so I am in mind and that's enough

but if thou be a king where is thy crown

my crown is in my heart not on my head
not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones
nor to be seen my crown is call'd content
a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy

well if you be a king crown'd with content
your crown content and you must be contented
to go along with us for as we think
you are the king King Edward hath depos'd
and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
will apprehend you as his enemy

but did you never swear and break an oath
no never such an oath nor will not now

where did you dwell when I was King of England

here in this country where we now remain

I was anointed king at nine months old
my father and my grandfather were kings
and you were sworn true subjects unto me
and tell me then have you not broke your oaths

no
for we were subjects but while you were king

why am I dead do I not breathe a man
Ah simple men you know not what you swear
look as I blow this feather from my face
and as the air blows it to me again
obeying with my wind when I do blow
commanded always by the greater gust
such is the lightness of you common men
but do not break your oaths for of that sin
my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
go where you will the king shall be commanded
and be you kings command and I'll obey

we are true subjects to the king King Edward

so would you be again to Henry
if he were seated as King Edward is

we charge you in God's name and in the king's
to go with us unto the officers

in God's name lead your king's name be obey'd
and what God will that let your king perform
and what he will I humbly yield unto

brother of Gloucester at Saint Alban's field
this lady's husband Sir John Grey was slain
his lands then seiz'd on by the conqueror
her suit is now to repossess those lands
which we in justice cannot well deny
because in quarrel of the house of York
the worthy gentleman did lose his life

your highness shall do well to grant her suit
it were dishonour to deny it her

it were no less but yet I'll make a pause

yea is it so
I see the lady hath a thing to grant
before the king will grant her humble suit

he knows the game how true he keeps the wind


widow we will consider of your suit
and come some other time to know our mind

right gracious lord I cannot brook delay
may it please your highness to resolve me now
and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me

ay widow then I'll warrant you all your lands
an if what pleases him shall pleasure you
fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow

I fear her not unless she chance to fall

God forbid that for he'll take vantages

how many children hast thou widow tell me

I think he means to beg a child of her
nay whip me then he'll rather give her two

three my most gracious lord

you shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him

'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands

be pitiful dread lord and grant it then

lords give us leave I'll try this widow's wit

ay good leave have you for you will have leave
till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch


now tell me madam do you love your children

ay full as dearly as I love myself
and would you not do much to do them good

to do them good I would sustain some harm

then get your husband's lands to do them good

therefore I came unto your majesty

I'll tell you how these lands are to be got

so shall you bind me to your highness' service

what service wilt thou do me if I give them

what you command that rests in me to do

but you will take exceptions to my boon

no gracious lord except I cannot do it
ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask

why then I will do what your Grace commands

he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble

as red as fire nay then her wax must melt

why stops my lord shall I not hear my task

an easy task tis but to love a king

that's soon perform'd because I am a subject

why then thy husband's lands I freely give thee

I take my leave with many thousand thanks

the match is made she seals it with a curtsy
but stay thee tis the fruits of love I mean

the fruits of love I mean my loving liege

ay but I fear me in another sense
what love think'st thou I sue so much to get

my love till death my humble thanks my prayers
that love which virtue begs and virtue grants

no by my troth I did not mean such love

why then you mean not as I thought you did

but now you partly may perceive my mind

my mind will never grant what I perceive
your highness aims at if I aim aright


to tell you plain I had rather lie in prison

why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands

why then mine honesty shall be my dower
for by that loss I will not purchase them

therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily

herein your highness wrongs both them and me
but mighty lord this merry inclination
accords not with the sadness of my suit
please you dismiss me either with ay or no

ay if thou wilt say ay' to my request
no if thou dost say no' to my demand

then no my lord My suit is at an end
the widow likes him not she knits her brows

he is the bluntest wooer in Christendom

her looks do argue her replete with modesty
her words do show her wit incomparable
all her perfections challenge sovereignty
one way or other she is for a king
and she shall be my love or else my queen
say that King Edward take thee for his queen

'Tis better said than done my gracious lord
I am a subject fit to jest withal
but far unfit to be a sovereign

sweet widow by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends
and that is to enjoy thee for my love

I know I am too mean to be your queen
and yet too good to be your concubine

you cavil widow I did mean my queen

'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father

no more than when my daughters call thee mother
thou art a widow and thou hast some children
and by God's mother I being but a bachelor
have other some why tis a happy thing
to be the father unto many sons
answer no more for thou shalt be my queen

the ghostly father now hath done his shrift

when he was made a shriver twas for shift

brothers you muse what chat we two have had
the widow likes it not for she looks very sad

you'd think it strange if I should marry her

to whom my lord

why Clarence to myself

that would be ten days' wonder at the least

that's a day longer than a wonder lasts

by so much is the wonder in extremes

well jest on brothers I can tell you both
her suit is granted for her husband's lands


my gracious lord Henry your foe is taken

see that he be convey'd unto the Tower
and go we brothers to the man that took him
to question of his apprehension
widow go you along Lords use her honourably


ay Edward will use women honourably
would he were wasted marrow bones and all
that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
to cross me from the golden time I look for
and yet between my soul's desire and me
the lustful Edward's title buried
is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward
and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies
to take their rooms ere I can place myself
a cold premeditation for my purpose
why then I do but dream on sovereignty
like one that stands upon a promontory
wishing his foot were equal with his eye
and chides the sea that sunders him from thence
saying he'll lade it dry to have his way
so do I wish the crown being so far off
and so I chide the means that keep me from it
and so I say I'll cut the causes off
flattering me with impossibilities
my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much
unless my hand and strength could equal them
well say there is no kingdom then for Richard
what other pleasure can the world afford
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap
and deck my body in gay ornaments
and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
O miserable thought and more unlikely
than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
why love forswore me in my mother's womb
and for I should not deal in her soft laws
she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
to make an envious mountain on my back
where sits deformity to mock my body
to shape my legs of an unequal size
to disproportion me in every part
like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear-whelp
that carries no impression like the dam
and am I then a man to be belov'd
O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
then since this earth affords no joy to me
but to command to check to o'erbear such
as are of better person than myself
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown
and whiles I live to account this world but hell
until my mis-shap'd trunk that bears this head
be round impaled with a glorious crown
and yet I know not how to get the crown
for many lives stand between me and home
and I like one lost in a thorny wood
that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns
not knowing how to find the open air
but toiling desperately to find it out
torment myself to catch the English crown
and from that torment I will free myself
or hew my way out with a bloody axe
why I can smile and murder while I smile
and cry Content to that which grieves my heart
and wet my cheeks with artificial tears
and frame my face to all occasions
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor
deceive more slily than Ulysses could
and like a Sinon take another Troy
I can add colours to the chameleon
change shapes with Proteus for advantages
and set the murd'rous Machiavel to school
can I do this and cannot get a crown
tut were it further off I'll pluck it down
fair Queen of England worthy Margaret
sit down with us it ill befits thy state
and birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit

no mighty King of France now Margaret
must strike her sail and learn a while to serve
where kings command I was I must confess
great Albion's queen in former golden days
but now mischance hath trod my title down
and with dishonour laid me on the ground
where I must take like seat unto my fortune
and to my humble seat conform myself

why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair

from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
and stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares

whate'er it be be thou still like thyself

yield not thy neck
to fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind
still ride in triumph over all mischance
be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief
it shall be eas'd if France can yield relief

those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
and give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak
now therefore be it known to noble Lewis
that Henry sole possessor of my love
is of a king become a banish'd man
and forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn
while proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
usurps the regal title and the seat
of England's true-anointed lawful king
this is the cause that I poor Margaret
with this my son Prince Edward Henry's heir
am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
Scotland hath will to help but cannot help
our people and our peers are both misled
our treasure seiz'd our soldiers put to flight
and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight

renowned queen with patience calm the storm
while we bethink a means to break it off

the more we stay the stronger grows our foe

the more I stay the more I'll succour thee

O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow


what's he approacheth boldly to our presence

our Earl of Warwick Edward's greatest friend
welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France


ay now begins a second storm to rise
for this is he that moves both wind and tide

from worthy Edward King of Albion
my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
I come in kindness and unfeigned love
first to do greetings to thy royal person
and then to crave a league of amity
and lastly to confirm that amity
with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
that virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister
to England's king in lawful marriage

if that go forward Henry's hope is done

and gracious madam in our king's behalf
humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
to tell the passion of my sov'reign's heart
where fame late entering at his heedful ears
hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue

king Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak
before you answer Warwick His demand
springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love
but from deceit bred by necessity
for how can tyrants safely govern home
unless abroad they purchase great alliance
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
that Henry liveth still but were he dead
yet here Prince Edward stands King Henry's son
look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage
thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
for though usurpers sway the rule awhile
yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs


and why not queen

because thy father Henry did usurp
and thou no more art prince than she is queen

then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt
which did subdue the greatest part of Spain
and after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth
whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
and after that wise prince Henry the Fifth
who by his prowess conquered all France
from these our Henry lineally descends

Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
you told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
all that which Henry the Fifth had gotten
methinks these peers of France should smile at that
but for the rest you tell a pedigree
to make prescription for a kingdom's worth

why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years
and not bewray thy treason with a blush

can Oxford that did ever fence the right
now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
for shame leave Henry and call Edward king

call him my king by whose injurious doom
my elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere
was done to death and more than so my father
even in the downfall of his mellow'd years
when nature brought him to the door of death
no Warwick no while life upholds this arm
this arm upholds the house of Lancaster

and I the house of York
queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford
vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
while I use further conference with Warwick


heaven grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not

now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
is Edward your true king for I were loath
to link with him that were not lawful chosen

thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour

but is he gracious in the people's eye

the more that Henry was unfortunate

then further all dissembling set aside
tell me for truth the measure of his love

such it seems
as may beseem a monarch like himself
myself have often heard him say and swear
that this his love was an eternal plant
whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground
the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun
exempt from envy but not from disdain
unless the Lady Bona quit his pain

now sister let us hear your firm resolve

your grant or your denial shall be mine


yet I confess that often ere this day
when I have heard your king's desert recounted
mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire

and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
touching the jointure that your king must make
which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd
draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness
that Bona shall be wife to the English king

to Edward but not to the English king

deceitful Warwick it was thy device
by this alliance to make void my suit
before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend

and still is friend to him and Margaret
but if your title to the crown be weak
as may appear by Edward's good success
then tis but reason that I be releas'd
from giving aid which late I promised
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
that your estate requires and mine can yield
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease
where having nothing nothing can he lose
and as for you yourself our quondam queen
you have a father able to maintain you
and better twere you troubled him than France

peace impudent and shameless Warwick peace
proud setter up and puller down of kings
I will not hence till with my talk and tears
both full of truth I make King Lewis behold
thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love
for both of you are birds of self-same feather


Warwick this is some post to us or thee


my lord ambassador these letters are for you
sent from your brother Marquess Montague


and madam these for you from whom I know not


I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his

nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled
I hope all's for the best

Warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen

mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys

mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent

what has your king married the Lady Grey
and now to soothe your forgery and his
is this the alliance that he seeks with France
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner

I told your majesty as much before
this proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty

king Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven
and by the hope I have of heavenly bliss
that I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's
no more my king for he dishonours me
but most himself if he could see his shame
did I forget that by the house of York
my father came untimely to his death
did I let pass the abuse done to my niece
did I impale him with the regal crown
did I put Henry from his native right
and am I guerdon'd at the last with shame
shame on himself for my desert is honour
and to repair my honour lost for him
my noble queen let former grudges pass
and henceforth I am thy true servitor
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona
and replant Henry in his former state

Warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love
and I forgive and quite forget old faults
and joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend

so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
that if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
with some few bands of chosen soldiers
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
and force the tyrant from his seat by war
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him
and as for Clarence as my letters tell me
he's very likely now to fall from him
for matching more for wanton lust than honour
or than for strength and safety of our country
dear brother how shall Bona be reveng'd
but by thy help to this distressed queen

renowned prince how shall poor Henry live
unless thou rescue him from foul despair

my quarrel and this English queen's are one

and mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours

and mine with hers and thine and Margaret's
therefore at last I firmly am resolv'd
you shall have aid

let me give humble thanks for all at once

then England's messenger return in post
and tell false Edward thy supposed king
that Lewis of France is sending over masquers
thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal

tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake

tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
and I am ready to put armour on

tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
and therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long
there's thy reward be gone


but Warwick
thou and Oxford with five thousand men
shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle
and as occasion serves this noble queen
and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt

this shall assure my constant loyalty
that if our queen and this young prince agree
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands

yes I agree and thank you for your motion
son Edward she is fair and virtuous
therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick
and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
that only Warwick's daughter shall be thine

yes I accept her for she well deserves it
and here to pledge my vow I give my hand


why stay we now These soldiers shall be levied
and thou Lord Bourbon our high admiral
shall waft them over with our royal fleet
for mocking marriage with a dame of France


I came from Edward as ambassador
but I return his sworn and mortal foe
matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
but dreadful war shall answer his demand
had he none else to make a stale but me
then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow
I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown
and I'll be chief to bring him down again
not that I pity Henry's misery
but seek revenge on Edward's mockery

now tell me brother Clarence what think you
of this new marriage with the Lady Grey
hath not our brother made a worthy choice

alas you know tis far from hence to France

my lords forbear this talk here comes the king

and his well-chosen bride

I mind to tell him plainly what I think

now brother Clarence how like you our choice
that you stand pensive as half malcontent

as well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick
which are so weak of courage and in judgment
that they'll take no offence at our abuse

suppose they take offence without a cause
they are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward
your king and Warwick's and must have my will

and you shall have your will because our king

yea brother Richard are you offended too

not I
no God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
whom God hath join'd together ay and twere pity
to sunder them that yoke so well together

setting your scorns and your mislike aside
tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
should not become my wife and England's queen
and you too Somerset and Montague
speak freely what you think

then this is mine opinion that King Lewis
becomes your enemy for mocking him
about the marriage of the Lady Bona

and Warwick doing what you gave in charge

what if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
by such invention as I can devise

yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage

why knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe if true within itself

yes but the safer when tis back'd with France

'Tis better using France than trusting France
let us be back'd with God and with the seas
which he hath given for fence impregnable
and with their helps only defend ourselves
in them and in ourselves our safety lies

to have the heir of the Lord Hungerford

ay what of that it was my will and grant
and for this once my will shall stand for law

and yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
to give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
unto the brother of your loving bride
she better would have fitted me or Clarence
but in your bride you bury brotherhood

or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son
and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere

alas poor Clarence is it for a wife
that thou art malcontent I will provide thee

in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment
to play the broker on mine own behalf
and to that end I shortly mind to leave you

leave me or tarry Edward will be king
and not be tied unto his brother's will

my lords before it pleas'd his majesty
to raise my state to title of a queen
do me but right and you must all-confess
that I was not ignoble of descent
and meaner than myself have had like fortune
but as this title honours me and mine
so your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing
do cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow

my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
what danger or what sorrow can befall thee
so long as Edward is thy constant friend
and their true sovereign whom they must obey
unless they seek for hatred at my hands
which if they do yet will I keep thee safe
and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath

I hear yet say not much but think the more


now messenger what letters or what news
from France

my sovereign liege no letters and few words
but such as I without your special pardon
dare not relate

go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
what answer makes King Lewis unto our letters

at my depart these were his very words
that Lewis of France is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride

is Lewis so brave belike he thinks me Henry
but what said Lady Bona to my marriage

these were her words utter'd with mild disdain
'Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake

I blame not her she could say little less
she had the wrong But what said Henry's queen
for I have heard that she was there in place

'Tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
and I am ready to put armour on

belike she minds to play the Amazon
but what said Warwick to these injuries
he more incens'd against your majesty
than all the rest discharg'd me with these words
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
and therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long

ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
well I will arm me being thus forewarn'd
they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
but say is Warwick friends with Margaret

ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship
that young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter

belike the elder Clarence will have the younger
now brother king farewell and sit you fast
for I will hence to Warwick's other daughter
that though I want a kingdom yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself
you that love me and Warwick follow me

not I
my thoughts aim at a further matter I
stay not for love of Edward but the crown

Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick
yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen
and haste is needful in this desperate case
Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf
go levy men and make prepare for war
they are already or quickly will be landed
myself in person will straight follow you

but ere I go Hastings and Montague
resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest
are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance
tell me if you love Warwick more than me
if it be so then both depart to him
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends
give me assurance with some friendly vow
that I may never have you in suspect

so God help Montague as he proves true

and Hastings as he favours Edward's cause

now brother Richard will you stand by us

ay in despite of all that shall withstand you

why so then am I sure of victory
now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
till we meet Warwick with his foreign power


trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
the common people by numbers swarm to us

but see where Somerset and Clarence come

speak suddenly my lords are we all friends

fear not that my lord

then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick
and welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice
to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love
else might I think that Clarence Edward's brother
were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
but welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine
and now what rests but in night's coverture
thy brother being carelessly encamp'd
his soldiers lurking in the towns about
and but attended by a simple guard
we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
our scouts have found the adventure very easy
with sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents
and brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds
so we well cover'd with the night's black mantle
at unawares may beat down Edward's guard
and seize himself I say not slaughter him
for I intend but only to surprise him
you that will follow me to this attempt
applaud the name of Henry with your leader

why then let's on our way in silent sort
for Warwick and his friends God and Saint George


come on my masters each man take his stand
the king by this is set him down to sleep

what will he not to bed

why no for he hath made a solemn vow
till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd

to-morrow then belike shall be the day
if Warwick be so near as men report

but say I pray what nobleman is that
that with the king here resteth in his tent

'Tis the Lord Hastings the king's chiefest friend

O is it so But why commands the king
that his chief followers lodge in towns about him
while he himself keeps in the cold field

'Tis the more honour because the more dangerous

ay but give me worship and quietness
I like it better than a dangerous honour
if Warwick knew in what estate he stands

unless our halberds did shut up his passage

ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
but to defend his person from night-foes


this is his tent and see where stand his guard
courage my masters honour now or never
but follow me and Edward shall be ours

who goes there

stay or thou diest


what are they that fly there

Richard and Hastings let them go here's the duke
the duke Why Warwick when we parted last
thou call'dst me king

ay but the case is alter'd
when you disgrac'd me in my embassade
then I degraded you from being king
and come now to create you Duke of York
alas how should you govern any kingdom
that know not how to use ambassadors
nor how to be contented with one wife
nor how to use your brothers brotherly
nor how to study for the people's welfare
nor how to shroud yourself from enemies

yea brother of Clarence art thou here too
nay then I see that Edward needs must down
yet Warwick in despite of all mischance
of thee thyself and all thy complices
Edward will always bear himself as king
my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel

then for his mind be Edward England's king

but Henry now shall wear the English crown
and be true king indeed thou but the shadow
my Lord of Somerset at my request
see that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
unto my brother Archbishop of York
when I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows
I'll follow you and tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him
now for a while farewell good Duke of York

what fates impose that men must needs abide
it boots not to resist both wind and tide


what now remains my lords for us to do

ay that's the first thing that we have to do
to free King Henry from imprisonment
and see him seated in the regal throne


madam what makes you in this sudden change

why brother Rivers are you yet to learn
what late misfortune is befall'n King Edward

what loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick

no but the loss of his own royal person

then is my sovereign slain

ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
and as I further have to understand
is new committed to the Bishop of York
fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe

these news I must confess are full of grief
yet gracious madam bear it as you may
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day

till then fair hope must hinder life's decay
and I the rather wean me from despair
for love of Edward's offspring in my womb
this is it that makes me bridle passion
and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross
ay ay for this I draw in many a tear
and stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs
lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
king Edward's fruit true heir to the English crown

but madam where is Warwick then become
I am inform'd that he comes towards London
to set the crown once more on Henry's head
guess thou the rest King Edward's friends must down
but to prevent the tyrant's violence
for trust not him that hath once broken faith
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
to save at least the heir of Edward's right
there shall I rest secure from force and fraud
come therefore let us fly while we may fly
if Warwick take us we are sure to die


now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley
leave off to wonder why I drew you hither
into this chiefest thicket of the park
thus stands the case You know our king my brother
is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
he hath good usage and great liberty
and often but attended with weak guard
I have advertis'd him by secret means
that if about this hour he make this way
under the colour of his usual game
he shall here find his friends with horse and men
to set him free from his captivity


this way my lord for this way lies the game

nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand
now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest
stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer

brother the time and case requireth haste
your horse stands ready at the park corner

but whither shall we then

to Lynn my lord and ship from thence to Flanders
well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning

Stanley I will requite thy forwardness

but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk

huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along

better do so than tarry and be hang'd

come then away let's ha' no more ado

bishop farewell shield thee from Warwick's frown
and pray that I may repossess the crown

master lieutenant now that God and friends
have shaken Edward from the regal seat
and turn'd my captive state to liberty
my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys

subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
but if a humble prayer may prevail
I then crave pardon of your majesty

for what lieutenant for well using me
nay be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness
for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
ay such a pleasure as encaged birds
conceive when after many moody thoughts
at last by notes of household harmony
they quite forget their loss of liberty
but Warwick after God thou set'st me free
and chiefly therefore I thank God and thee
he was the author thou the instrument
therefore that I may conquer Fortune's spite
by living low where Fortune cannot hurt me
and that the people of this blessed land
may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars
I here resign my government to thee
for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds

your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous
and now may seem as wise as virtuous
by spying and avoiding Fortune's malice
for few men rightly temper with the stars
yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace
for choosing me when Clarence is in place

no Warwick thou art worthy of the sway
to whom the heavens in thy nativity
adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown
as likely to be blest in peace and war
and therefore I yield thee my free consent

and I choose Clarence only for protector

Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands
that no dissension hinder government
I make you both protectors of this land
while I myself will lead a private life
and in devotion spend my latter days
to sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise

what answers Clarence to his sovereign's will

that he consents if Warwick yield consent
for on thy fortune I repose myself

why then though loath yet must I be content
we'll yoke together like a double shadow
to Henry's body and supply his place
I mean in bearing weight of government
while he enjoys the honour and his ease
and Clarence now then it is more than needful
forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor
and all his lands and goods be confiscate
what else and that succession be determin'd

ay therein Clarence shall not want his part

but with the first of all your chief affairs
let me entreat for I command no more
that Margaret your queen and my son Edward
be sent for to return from France with speed
for till I see them here by doubtful fear
my joy of liberty is half eclips'd

it shall be done my sov'reign with all speed

my Lord of Somerset what youth is that
of whom you seem to have so tender care

my liege it is young Henry Earl of Richmond

come hither England's hope
if secret powers
suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss
his looks are full of peaceful majesty
his head by nature fram'd to wear a crown
his hand to wield a sceptre and himself
likely in time to bless a regal throne
make much of him my lords for this is he
must help you more than you are hurt by me


what news my friend

that Edward is escaped from your brother
and fled as he hears since to Burgundy

unsavoury news but how made he escape

he was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
in secret ambush on the forest side
and from the bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him
for hunting was his daily exercise

my brother was too careless of his charge
but let us hence my sovereign to provide
a salve for any sore that may betide


my lord I like not of this flight of Edward's
for doubtless Burgundy will yield him help
and we shall have more wars before't be long
as Henry's late presaging prophecy
did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond
so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
what may befall him to his harm and ours
therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst
forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany
till storms be past of civil enmity
ay for if Edward repossess the crown
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down

it shall be so he shall to Brittany
come therefore let's about it speedily


now brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest
yet thus far Fortune maketh us amends
and says that once more I shall interchange
my waned state for Henry's regal crown
well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
and brought desired help from Burgundy
what then remains we being thus arriv'd
from Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York
but that we enter as into our dukedom

the gates made fast Brother I like not this
for many men that stumble at the threshold

tush man abodements must not now affright us
by fair or foul means we must enter in
for hither will our friends repair to us

my liege I'll knock once more to summon them


my lords we were forewarned of your coming
and shut the gates for safety of ourselves
for now we owe allegiance unto Henry

but Master Mayor if Henry be your king
yet Edward at the least is Duke of York

true my good lord I know you for no less

why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom
as being well content with that alone
but when the fox hath once got in his nose
he'll soon find means to make the body follow

why Master Mayor why stand you in a doubt
open the gates we are King Henry's friends

ay say you so the gates shall then be open'd


a wise stout captain and soon persuaded

the good old man would fain that all were well
so twere not long of him but being enter'd
I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade
both him and all his brothers unto reason


so Master Mayor these gates must not be shut
but in the night or in the time of war

for Edward will defend the town and thee
and all those friends that deign to follow me


brother this is Sir John Montgomery
our trusty friend unless I be deceiv'd

welcome Sir John but why come you in arms

to help King Edward in his time of storm
as every loyal subject ought to do

thanks good Montgomery but we now forget
our title to the crown and only claim
our dukedom till God please to send the rest

then fare you well for I will hence again
I came to serve a king and not a duke


nay stay Sir John awhile and we'll debate
by what safe means the crown may be recover'd

what talk you of debating in few words
if you'll not here proclaim yourself our king
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
to keep them back that come to succour you
why shall we fight if you pretend no title

why brother wherefore stand you on nice points

when we grow stronger then we'll make our claim
till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning

away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule

and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
the bruit thereof will bring you many friends

then be it as you will for tis my right
and Henry but usurps the diadem

ay now my sov'reign speaketh like himself
and now will I be Edward's champion

sound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaim'd
come fellow soldier make thou proclamation


Edward the Fourth by the grace of God King of England and France and Lord of Ireland &c

and whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right
by this I challenge him to single fight


long live Edward the Fourth
thanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all
if Fortune serve me I'll requite this kindness
now for this night let's harbour here in York
and when the morning sun shall raise his car
above the border of this horizon
we'll forward towards Warwick and his mates
for well I wot that Henry is no soldier
Ah froward Clarence how evil it beseems thee
to flatter Henry and forsake thy brother
yet as we may we'll meet both thee and Warwick
come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day
and that once gotten doubt not of large pay


what counsel lords Edward from Belgia
with hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders
hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas
and with his troops doth march amain to London
and many giddy people flock to him
let's levy men and beat him back again

a little fire is quickly trodden out
which being suffer'd rivers cannot quench

in Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends
not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
those will I muster up and thou son Clarence
shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent
the knights and gentlemen to come with thee
thou brother Montague in Buckingham
Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find
men well inclin'd to hear what thou command'st
and thou brave Oxford wondrous well belov'd
in Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
my sov'reign with the loving citizens
like to his island girt in with the ocean
or modest Dian circled with her nymphs
shall rest in London till we come to him
farewell my sovereign

farewell my Hector and my Troy's true hope

in sign of truth I kiss your highness' hand

well-minded Clarence be thou fortunate

comfort my lord and so I take my leave

and thus I seal my truth and bid adieu

sweet Oxford and my loving Montague
and all at once once more a happy farewell

farewell sweet lords let's meet at Coventry


here at the palace will I rest awhile
methinks the power that Edward hath in field
should not be able to encounter mine

the doubt is that he will seduce the rest

that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands
nor posted off their suits with slow delays
my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs
my mercy dried their water-flowing tears
I have not been desirous of their wealth
nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies
nor forward of revenge though they much err'd
then why should they love Edward more than me
no Exeter these graces challenge grace
and when the lion fawns upon the lamb
the lamb will never cease to follow him

hark hark my lord what shouts are these


seize on the shame-fac'd Henry bear him hence
and once again proclaim us King of England
you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry
and swell so much the higher by their ebb
hence with him to the Tower let him not speak

and lords towards Coventry bend we our course
where peremptory Warwick now remains
the sun shines hot and if we use delay
cold biting winter mars our hop'd-for hay

away betimes before his forces join
and take the great-grown traitor unawares
brave warriors march amain towards Coventry

how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow

by this at Dunsmore marching hitherward

how far off is our brother Montague
where is the post that came from Montague

by this at Daintry with a puissant troop


say Somerville what says my loving son
and by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now

at Southam I did leave him with his forces
and do expect him here some two hours hence


then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum

the drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick

who should that be belike unlook'd for friends

they are at hand and you shall quickly know


go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle

see how the surly Warwick mans the wall

O unbid spite is sportful Edward come
where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd
that we could hear no news of his repair

now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy
and he shall pardon thee these outrages
nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down
call Warwick patron and be penitent
and thou shalt still remain the Duke of York

I thought at least he would have said the king
or did he make the jest against his will

is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift

ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
I'll do thee service for so good a gift

'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother

why then tis mine if but by Warwick's gift

thou art no Atlas for so great a weight
and weakling Warwick takes his gift again

but Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner
and gallant Warwick do but answer this
what is the body when the head is off

alas that Warwick had no more forecast
but whiles he thought to steal the single ten
the king was slily finger'd from the deck
you left poor Henry at the bishop's palace
and ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower

'Tis even so yet you are Warwick still

come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
nay when strike now or else the iron cools

I had rather chop this hand off at a blow
and with the other fling it at thy face
than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
this hand fast wound about thy coal-black hair
shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
write in the dust this sentence with thy blood
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more


O cheerful colours see where Oxford comes

Oxford Oxford for Lancaster


the gates are open let us enter too

so other foes may set upon our backs
stand we in good array for they no doubt
will issue out again and bid us battle
if not the city being but of small defence
we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same
O welcome Oxford for we want thy help


Montague Montague for Lancaster


thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
even with the dearest blood your bodies bear

the harder match'd the greater victory
my mind presageth happy gain and conquest


Somerset Somerset for Lancaster


two of thy name both Dukes of Somerset
have sold their lives unto the house of York
and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold

and lo where George of Clarence sweeps along
of force enough to bid his brother battle
with whom an upright zeal to right prevails
more than the nature of a brother's love
come Clarence come thou wilt if Warwick call

father of Warwick know you what this means

look here I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father's house
who gave his blood to lime the stones together
and set up Lancaster Why trow'st thou Warwick
that Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
to bend the fatal instruments of war
against his brother and his lawful king
perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
to keep that oath were more impiety
than Jephthah's when he sacrific'd his daughter
that to deserve well at my brother's hands
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
with resolution wheresoe'er I meet thee
as I will meet thee if thou stir abroad
to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
and so proud-hearted Warwick I defy thee
and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
pardon me Edward I will make amends
and Richard do not frown upon my faults
for I will henceforth be no more unconstant

now welcome more and ten times more belov'd
than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate

welcome good Clarence this is brother-like

O passing traitor perjur'd and unjust

what Warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight

alas I am not coop'd here for defence
I will away towards Barnet presently
and bid thee battle Edward if thou dar'st

yes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way
lords to the field Saint George and victory


so lie thou there die thou and die our fear
for Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all
now Montague sit fast I seek for thee
that Warwick's bones may keep thine company


Ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe
and tell me who is victor York or Warwick
why ask I that my mangled body shows
my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
and by my fall the conquest to my foe
thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge
whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
under whose shade the ramping lion slept
whose top branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
and kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind
these eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil
have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
to search the secret treasons of the world
the wrinkles in my brows now fill'd with blood
were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres
for who liv'd king but I could dig his grave
and who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow
lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood
my parks my walks my manors that I had
even now forsake me and of all my lands
is nothing left me but my body's length
why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
and live we how we can yet die we must

Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are
we might recover all our loss again
the queen from France hath brought a puissant power
even now we heard the news Ah couldst thou fly

why then I would not fly Ah Montague
if thou be there sweet brother take my hand
and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst
thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
that glues my lips and will not let me speak
come quickly Montague or I am dead

Ah Warwick Montague hath breath'd his last
and to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick
and said Commend me to my valiant brother
and more he would have said and more he spoke
which sounded like a clamour in a vault
I well might hear deliver'd with a groan
'O farewell Warwick

sweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves
for Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven


away away to meet the queen's great power


thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
and we are grac'd with wreaths of victory
but in the midst of this bright-shining day
I spy a black suspicious threat'ning cloud
that will encounter with our glorious sun
ere he attain his easeful western bed
I mean my lords those powers that the queen
hath rais'd in Gallia have arriv'd our coast
and as we hear march on to fight with us
a little gale will soon disperse that cloud
and blow it to the source from whence it came
thy very beams will dry those vapours up
for every cloud engenders not a storm

the queen is valu'd thirty thousand strong
and Somerset with Oxford fled to her
if she have time to breathe be well assur'd
her faction will be full as strong as ours

we are advertis'd by our loving friends
that they do hold their course toward Tewksbury
we having now the best at Barnet field
will thither straight for willingness rids way
and as we march our strength will be augmented
in every county as we go along
strike up the drum cry Courage and away


but cheerly seek how to redress their harms
what though the mast be now blown over-board
the cable broke the holding anchor lost
and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood
yet lives our pilot still is't meet that he
should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
with tearful eyes add water to the sea
and give more strength to that which hath too much
whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
which industry and courage might have sav'd
Ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
say Warwick was our anchor what of that
and Montague our top-mast what of him
our slaughter'd friends the tackles what of these
why is not Oxford here another anchor
and Somerset another goodly mast
the friends of France our shrouds and tacklings
and though unskilful why not Ned and I
for once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge
but keep our course though the rough wind say no
from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack
as good to chide the waves as speak them fair
and what is Edward but a ruthless sea
what Clarence but a quicksand of deceit
and Richard but a ragged fatal rock
all those the enemies to our poor bark
say you can swim alas tis but a while
tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
or else you famish that's a threefold death
this speak I lords to let you understand
in case some one of you would fly from us
that there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers
more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
why courage then what cannot be avoided
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear

methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
infuse his breast with magnanimity
and make him naked foil a man at arms
I speak not this as doubting any here
for did I but suspect a fearful man
he should have leave to go away betimes
lest in our need he might infect another
and make him of like spirit to himself
if any such be here as God forbid
let him depart before we need his help

women and children of so high a courage
and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame
O brave young prince thy famous grandfather
doth live again in thee long mayst thou live
to bear his image and renew his glories

and he that will not fight for such a hope
go home to bed and like the owl by day
if he arise be mock'd and wonder'd at
thanks gentle Somerset sweet Oxford thanks

and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else


prepare you lords for Edward is at hand
ready to fight therefore be resolute

I thought no less it is his policy
to haste thus fast to find us unprovided

but he's deceiv'd we are in readiness

this cheers my heart to see your forwardness

here pitch our battle hence we will not budge


brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood
must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night
I need not add more fuel to your fire
for well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
give signal to the fight and to it lords

lords knights and gentlemen what I should say
my tears gainsay for every word I speak
ye see I drink the water of mine eyes
therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign
is prisoner to the foe his state usurp'd
his realm a slaughter house his subjects slain
his statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent
and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil
you fight in justice then in God's name lords
be valiant and give signal to the fight


now here a period of tumultuous broils
away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight
go bear them hence I will not hear them speak

for my part I'll not trouble thee with words

nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune


so part we sadly in this troublous world
to meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem

is proclamation made that who finds Edward
shall have a high reward and he his life

it is and lo where youthful Edward comes


bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak
what can so young a thorn begin to prick
Edward what satisfaction canst thou make
and all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to

speak like a subject proud ambitious York
suppose that I am now my father's mouth
resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou
whilst I propose the self-same words to thee
which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to

Ah that thy father had been so resolv'd

that you might still have worn the petticoat
and ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster

let sop fable in a winter's night
his currish riddles sort not with this place

by heaven brat I'll plague you for that word

ay thou wast born to be a plague to men
for God's sake take away this captive scold

nay take away this scolding crookback rather

peace wilful boy or I will charm your tongue

untutor'd lad thou art too malapert

I know my duty you are all undutiful
lascivious Edward and thou perjur'd George
and thou mis-shapen Dick I tell ye all
I am your better traitors as ye are
and thou usurp'st my father's right and mine

take that the likeness of this railer here


sprawl'st thou take that to end thy agony

and there's for twitting me with perjury


O kill me too

marry and shall


hold Richard hold for we have done too much

why should she live to fill the world with words

what doth she swoon use means for her recovery

Clarence excuse me to the king my brother
I'll hence to London on a serious matter
ere ye come there be sure to hear some news

what what
the Tower the Tower


O Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boy
canst thou not speak O traitors murderers
they that stabb'd C sar shed no blood at all
did not offend nor were not worthy blame
if this foul deed were by to equal it
he was a man this in respect a child
and men ne'er spend their fury on a child
what's worse than murderer that I may name it
no no my heart will burst an if I speak
and I will speak that so my heart may burst
butchers and villains bloody cannibals
how sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd
you have no children butchers if you had
the thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse
but if you ever chance to have a child
look in his youth to have him so cut off

away with her go bear her hence perforce

nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
here sheathe thy sword I'll pardon thee my death
what wilt thou not then Clarence do it thou

by heaven I will not do thee so much ease

good Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do it

didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it

ay but thou usest to forswear thyself
'Twas sin before but now tis charity
what wilt thou not Where is that devil's butcher
hard-favour'd Richard Richard where art thou
thou art not here murder is thy alms-deed
petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back
away I say I charge ye bear her hence

so come to you and yours as to this prince


where's Richard gone

to London all in post and as I guess
to make a bloody supper in the Tower

he's sudden if a thing comes in his head
now march we hence discharge the common sort
with pay and thanks and let's away to London
and see our gentle queen how well she fares
by this I hope she hath a son for me

good day my lord What at your book so hard

ay my good lord my lord I should say rather
'Good Gloucester' and good devil' were alike
and both preposterous therefore not good lord

sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer


so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
and next his throat unto the butcher's knife
what scene of death hath Roscius now to act

suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
the thief doth fear each bush an officer

the bird that hath been limed in a bush
with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
and I the hapless male to one sweet bird
have now the fatal object in my eye
where my poor young was lim'd was caught and kill'd
why what a peevish fool was that of Crete
that taught his son the office of a fowl
and yet for all his wings the fool was drown'd

I D dalus my poor boy Icarus
thy father Minos that denied our course
the sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
thy brother Edward and thyself the sea
whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
my breast can better brook thy dagger's point
than can my ears that tragic history
but wherefore dost thou come is't for my life

think'st thou I am an executioner

a persecutor I am sure thou art
if murd'ring innocents be executing
why then thou art an executioner
thy son I kill'd for his presumption

hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume
thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine
and thus I prophesy that many a thousand
which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's
and many an orphan's water-standing eye
men for their sons' wives for their husbands'
and orphans for their parents' timeless death
shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
the owl shriek'd at thy birth an evil sign
the night-crow cried aboding luckless time
dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees
the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top
and chattering pies in dismal discords sung
thy mother felt more than a mother's pain
and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope
to wit an indigest deformed lump
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
to signify thou cam'st to bite the world
and if the rest be true which I have heard
thou cam'st

I'll hear no more die prophet in thy speech

for this amongst the rest was I ordain'd

ay and for much more slaughter after this
O God forgive my sins and pardon thee


what will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted
see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death
O may such purple tears be always shed
from those that wish the downfall of our house
if any spark of life be yet remaining

I that have neither pity love nor fear
indeed tis true that Henry told me of
for I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward
had I not reason think ye to make haste
and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right
the midwife wonder'd and the women cried
'O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth
and so I was which plainly signified
that I should snarl and bite and play the dog
then since the heavens have shap'd my body so
let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it
I have no brother I am like no brother
and this word love which greybeards call divine
be resident in men like one another
and not in me I am myself alone
Clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light
but I will sort a pitchy day for thee
that Edward shall be fearful of his life
and then to purge his fear I'll be thy death
king Henry and the prince his son are gone
Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
counting myself but bad till I be best
I'll throw thy body in another room
and triumph Henry in thy day of doom

once more we sit in England's royal throne
re-purchas'd with the blood of enemies
what valiant foemen like to autumn's corn
have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride
three Dukes of Somerset threefold renown'd
for hardy and undoubted champions
two Cliffords as the father and the son
and two Northumberlands two braver men
ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound
with them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague
that in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
and made our footstool of security
come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy
young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself
have in our armours watch'd the winter's night
went all a-foot in summer's scalding heat
that thou might'st repossess the crown in peace
and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain

I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid
for yet I am not look'd on in the world
this shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave
and heave it shall some weight or break my back
work thou the way and thou shalt execute

Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen
and kiss your princely nephew brothers both

the duty that I owe unto your majesty

thanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanks

and that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st
witness the loving kiss I give the fruit


to say the truth so Judas kiss'd his master
and cried all hail when as he meant all harm

now am I seated as my soul delights
having my country's peace and brothers' loves

what will your Grace have done with Margaret
Reignier her father to the King of France
hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem
and hither have they sent it for her ransom

away with her and waft her hence to France
with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
such as befit the pleasure of the court
sound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoy
for here I hope begins our lasting joy

THE TRAGEDY OF KING RICHARD II

old John of Gaunt time-honour'd Lancaster
hast thou according to thy oath and band
brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son
here to make good the boisterous late appeal
which then our leisure would not let us hear
against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray

I have my liege

tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
if he appeal the duke on ancient malice
or worthily as a good subject should

as near as I could sift him on that argument
on some apparent danger seen in him
aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice

then call them to our presence face to face
and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
the accuser and the accused freely speak

high-stomach'd are they both and full of ire
in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire


many years of happy days befall
my gracious sovereign my most loving liege

each day still better other's happiness
until the heavens envying earth's good hap
add an immortal title to your crown
we thank you both yet one but flatters us
as well appeareth by the cause you come
namely to appeal each other of high treason
cousin of Hereford what dost thou object
against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray

first heaven be the record to my speech
in the devotion of a subject's love
tendering the precious safety of my prince
and free from other misbegotten hate
come I appellant to this princely presence
now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee
and mark my greeting well for what I speak
my body shall make good upon this earth
or my divine soul answer it in heaven
thou art a traitor and a miscreant
too good to be so and too bad to live
since the more fair and crystal is the sky
the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
with a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat
and wish so please my sovereign ere I move
what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove

let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war
the bitter clamour of two eager tongues
can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this
yet can I not of such tame patience boast
as to be hush'd and nought at all to say
first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
from giving reins and spurs to my free speech
which else would post until it had return'd
these terms of treason doubled down his throat
setting aside his high blood's royalty
and let him be no kinsman to my liege
I do defy him and I spit at him
call him a slanderous coward and a villain
and meet him were I tied to run afoot
even to the frozen ridges of the Alps
or any other ground inhabitable
wherever Englishman durst set his foot
meantime let this defend my loyalty
by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie

pale trembling coward there I throw my gage
disclaiming here the kindred of the king
and lay aside my high blood's royalty
which fear not reverence makes thee to except
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
as to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop
by that and all the rites of knighthood else
will I make good against thee arm to arm
what I have spoke or thou canst worse devise

I take it up and by that sword I swear
which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
or chivalrous design of knightly trial
and when I mount alive may I not light
if I be traitor or unjustly fight

what doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge
it must be great that can inherit us
so much as of a thought of ill in him

look what I speak my life shall prove it true
that Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles
in name of lendings for your highness' soldiers
the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments
like a false traitor and injurious villain
besides I say and will in battle prove
or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
that ever was survey'd by English eye
that all the treasons for these eighteen years
complotted and contrived in this land
fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring
upon his bad life to make all this good
that he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death
suggest his soon believing adversaries
and consequently like a traitor coward
sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood
which blood like sacrificing Abel's cries
even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
to me for justice and rough chastisement
and by the glorious worth of my descent
this arm shall do it or this life be spent

how high a pitch his resolution soars
Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this

O let my sovereign turn away his face
and bid his ears a little while be deaf
till I have told this slander of his blood
how God and good men hate so foul a liar

were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir
as he is but my father's brother's son
now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow
such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
should nothing privilege him nor partialize
the unstooping firmness of my upright soul
he is our subject Mowbray so art thou
free speech and fearless I to thee allow

then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
disburs'd I duly to his highness' soldiers
the other part reserv'd I by consent
for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
upon remainder of a dear account
since last I went to France to fetch his queen
now swallow down that lie For Gloucester's death
I slew him not but to mine own disgrace
for you my noble Lord of Lancaster
the honourable father to my foe
once did I lay an ambush for your life
a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
but ere I last receiv'd the sacrament
I did confess it and exactly begg'd
your Grace's pardon and I hope I had it
this is my fault as for the rest appeal'd
it issues from the rancour of a villain
a recreant and most degenerate traitor
which in myself I boldly will defend
and interchangeably hurl down my gage
upon this overweening traitor's foot
to prove myself a loyal gentleman
even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom
in haste whereof most heartily I pray
your highness to assign our trial day

wrath-kindled gentlemen be rul'd by me
this we prescribe though no physician
deep malice makes too deep incision
forget forgive conclude and be agreed
our doctors say this is no month to bleed
good uncle let this end where it begun
we'll calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son

to be a make-peace shall become my age
throw down my son the Duke of Norfolk's gage

and Norfolk throw down his

when Harry when
obedience bids I should not bid again

Norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot

myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot
my life thou shalt command but not my shame
despite of death that lives upon my grave
to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have
I am disgrac'd impeach'd and baffled here
pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear
the which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
which breath'd this poison

rage must be withstood
give me his gage lions make leopards tame

yea but not change his spots take but my shame
and I resign my gage My dear dear lord
the purest treasure mortal times afford
is spotless reputation that away
men are but gilded loam or painted clay
a jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
mine honour is my life both grow in one
take honour from me and my life is done
in that I live and for that will I die

cousin throw down your gage do you begin

O God defend my soul from such deep sin
shall I seem crest fall'n in my father's sight
or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
before this out-dar'd dastard Ere my tongue
shall wound mine honour with such feeble wrong
or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
the slavish motive of recanting fear
and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
where shame doth harbour even in Mowbray's face


we were not born to sue but to command
which since we cannot do to make you friends
be ready as your lives shall answer it
at Coventry upon Saint Lambert's day
the swelling difference of your settled hate
since we cannot atone you we shall see
justice design the victor's chivalry
marshal command our officers-at-arms
be ready to direct these home alarms


alas the part I had in Woodstock's blood
doth more solicit me than your exclaims
to stir against the butchers of his life
but since correction lieth in those hands
which made the fault that we cannot correct
put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
who when they see the hours ripe on earth
will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads

finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
hath love in thy old blood no living fire
Edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one
or seven fair branches springing from one root
some of those seven are dried by nature's course
some of those branches by the Destinies cut
but Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester
one vial full of Edward's sacred blood
one flourishing branch of his most royal root
is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt
is hack'd down and his summer leaves all vaded
by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe
Ah Gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
that metal that self-mould that fashion'd thee
made him a man and though thou liv'st and breath'st
yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent
in some large measure to thy father's death
in that thou seest thy wretched brother die
who was the model of thy father's life
call it not patience Gaunt it is despair
in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd
thou show'st the naked pathway to thy life
that which in mean men we entitle patience
is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
what shall I say to safeguard thine own life
the best way is to venge my Gloucester's death

God's is the quarrel for God's substitute
his deputy anointed in his sight
hath caus'd his death the which if wrongfully
let heaven revenge for I may never lift
an angry arm against his minister

where then alas may I complain myself

to God the widow's champion and defence

why then I will Farewell old Gaunt
thou go'st to Coventry there to behold
our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight
O sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear
or if misfortune miss the first career
be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
that they may break his foaming courser's back
and throw the rider headlong in the lists
a caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford
farewell old Gaunt thy sometimes brother's wife
with her companion grief must end her life

sister farewell I must to Coventry
as much good stay with thee as go with me

yet one word more Grief boundeth where it falls
not with the empty hollowness but weight
I take my leave before I have begun
for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
commend me to my brother Edmund York
lo this is all nay yet depart not so
though this be all do not so quickly go
I shall remember more Bid him ah what
alack and what shall good old York there see
but empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls
unpeopled offices untrodden stones
and what hear there for welcome but my groans
therefore commend me let him not come there
to seek out sorrow that dwells every where
desolate desolate will I hence and die
the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye


my Lord Aumerle is Harry Hereford arm'd

yea at all points and longs to enter in

the Duke of Norfolk sprightfully and bold
stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet

why then the champions are prepar'd and stay
for nothing but his majesty's approach

marshal demand of yonder champion
the cause of his arrival here in arms
ask him his name and orderly proceed
to swear him in the justice of his cause

in God's name and the king's say who thou art
and why thou com'st thus knightly clad in arms
against what man thou com'st and what thy quarrel
speak truly on thy knighthood and thine oath
as so defend thee heaven and thy valour

my name is Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
who hither come engaged by my oath
which God defend a knight should violate
both to defend my loyalty and truth
to God my king and his succeeding issue
against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
and by the grace of God and this mine arm
a traitor to my God my king and me
and as I truly fight defend me heaven

marshal ask yonder knight in arms
both who he is and why he cometh hither
thus plated in habiliments of war
and formally according to our law
depose him in the justice of his cause

what is thy name and wherefore com'st thou hither
before King Richard in his royal lists
against whom comest thou and what's thy quarrel
speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven

Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
am I who ready here do stand in arms
to prove by God's grace and my body's valour
in lists on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
that he's a traitor foul and dangerous
and as I truly fight defend me heaven

on pain of death no person be so bold
or daring-hardy as to touch the lists
except the marshal and such officers
appointed to direct these fair designs

lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign's hand
and bow my knee before his majesty
for Mowbray and myself are like two men
that vow a long and weary pilgrimage
then let us take a ceremonious leave
and loving farewell of our several friends

the appellant in all duty greets your highness
and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave

we will descend and fold him in our arms
cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right
farewell my blood which if to-day thou shed
lament we may but not revenge thee dead

O let no noble eye profane a tear
for me if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear
as confident as is the falcon's flight
against a bird do I with Mowbray fight
my loving lord I take my leave of you
of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle
not sick although I have to do with death
but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
lo as at English feasts so I regreet
the daintiest last to make the end most sweet
O thou the earthly author of my blood
whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
doth with a two-fold vigour lift me up
to reach at victory above my head
add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
and with thy blessings steel my lance's point
and furbish new the name of John a Gaunt
even in the lusty haviour of his son

God in thy good cause make thee prosperous
be swift like lightning in the execution
and let thy blows doubly redoubled
fall like amazing thunder on the casque
of thy adverse pernicious enemy
rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live

mine innocency and Saint George to thrive


however God or fortune cast my lot
there lives or dies true to King Richard's throne
a loyal just and upright gentleman
never did captive with a freer heart
cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement
this feast of battle with mine adversary
most mighty liege and my companion peers
take from my mouth the wish of happy years
as gentle and as jocund as to jest
go I to fight truth has a quiet breast

farewell my lord securely I espy
virtue with valour couched in thine eye
order the trial marshal and begin


Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
receive thy lance and God defend the right

strong as a tower in hope I cry amen

go bear this lance to Thomas Duke of Norfolk

Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
on pain to be found false and recreant
to prove the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
a traitor to his God his king and him
and dares him to set forward to the fight

here standeth Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
on pain to be found false and recreant
both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
to God his sovereign and to him disloyal
courageously and with a free desire
attending but the signal to begin

sound trumpets and set forward combatants

stay stay the king hath thrown his warderdown

let them lay by their helmets and their spears
and both return back to their chairs again
while we return these dukes what we decree

draw near
and list what with our council we have done
for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
with that dear blood which it hath fostered
and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' swords
and for we think the eagle-winged pride
of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts
with rival-hating envy set on you
to wake our peace which in our country's cradle
draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
which so rous'd up with boist'rous untun'd drums
with harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray
and grating shock of wrathful iron arms
might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
and make us wade even in our kindred's blood
therefore we banish you our territories
till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
shall not regreet our fair dominions
but tread the stranger paths of banishment

your will be done this must my comfort be
that sun that warms you here shall shine on me
and those his golden beams to you here lent
shall point on me and gild my banishment

Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
which I with some unwillingness pronounce
the sly slow hours shall not determinate
the dateless limit of thy dear exile
the hopeless word of never to return'
breathe I against thee upon pain of life

a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
and all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth
a dearer merit not so deep a maim
have I deserved at your highness' hands
the language I have learn'd these forty years
my native English now I must forego
and now my tongue's use is to me no more
than an unstringed viol or a harp
or like a cunning instrument cas'd up
or being open put into his hands
that knows no touch to tune the harmony
within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue
doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips
and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
is made my gaoler to attend on me
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse
too far in years to be a pupil now
what is thy sentence then but speechless death
which robs my tongue from breathing native breath

it boots thee not to be compassionate
after our sentence plaining comes too late
then thus I turn me from my country's light
to dwell in solemn shades of endless night


return again and take an oath with thee
lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands
swear by the duty that you owe to God
our part therein we banish with yourselves
to keep the oath that we administer
you never shall so help you truth and God
embrace each other's love in banishment
nor never look upon each other's face
nor never write regreet nor reconcile
this low'ring tempest of your home-bred hate
nor never by advised purpose meet
to plot contrive or complot any ill
'Gainst us our state our subjects or our land

I swear
and I to keep all this

Norfolk so far as to mine enemy
by this time had the king permitted us
one of our souls had wander'd in the air
banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
as now our flesh is banish'd from this land
confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
since thou hast far to go bear not along
the clogging burden of a guilty soul

no Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor
my name be blotted from the book of life
and I from heaven banish'd as from hence
but what thou art God thou and I do know
and all too soon I fear the king shall rue
farewell my liege Now no way can I stray
save back to England all the world's my way

uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect
hath from the number of his banish'd years
pluck'd four away

six frozen winters spent
return with welcome home from banishment

how long a time lies in one little word
four lagging winters and four wanton springs
end in a word such is the breath of kings

I thank my liege that in regard of me
he shortens four years of my son's exile
but little vantage shall I reap thereby
for ere the six years that he hath to spend
can change their moons and bring their times about
my oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
shall be extinct with age and endless night
and blindfold death not let me see my son

why uncle thou hast many years to live

but not a minute king that thou canst give
shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
thou canst help time to furrow me with age
but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
thy word is current with him for my death
but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath

thy son is banish'd upon good advice
whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave
why at our justice seem'st thou then to lower

things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
you urg'd me as a judge but I had rather
you would have bid me argue like a father
to smooth his fault I should have been more mild
a partial slander sought I to avoid
and in the sentence my own life destroy'd
alas I look'd when some of you should say
I was too strict to make mine own away
but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
against my will to do myself this wrong

cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
six years we banish him and he shall go


cousin farewell what presence must not know
from where you do remain let paper show

my lord no leave take I for I will ride
as far as land will let me by your side

O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words

I have too few to take my leave of you
when the tongue's office should be prodigal
to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart

thy grief is but thy absence for a time

joy absent grief is present for that time

what is six winters they are quickly gone

to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten

call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure

my heart will sigh when I miscall it so
which finds it an inforced pilgrimage

the sullen passage of thy weary steps
the precious jewel of thy home return

nay rather every tedious stride I make
will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love
must I not serve a long apprenticehood
to foreign passages and in the end
having my freedom boast of nothing else
but that I was a journeyman to grief

all places that the eye of heaven visits
are to a wise man ports and happy havens
teach thy necessity to reason thus
there is no virtue like necessity
think not the king did banish thee
but thou the king Woe doth the heavier sit
where it perceives it is but faintly borne
go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
and not the king exil'd thee or suppose
and thou art flying to a fresher clime
look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
to lie that way thou go'st not whence thou com'st
suppose the singing birds musicians
the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd
the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
than a delightful measure or a dance
for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
the man that mocks at it and sets it light

O who can hold a fire in his hand
by thinking on the frosty Caucasus
or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
by bare imagination of a feast
or wallow naked in December snow
by thinking on fantastic summer's heat
O no the apprehension of the good
gives but the greater feeling to the worse
fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more

come come my son I'll bring thee on thy way
had I thy youth and cause I would not stay

then England's ground farewell sweet soil adieu
my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
where'er I wander boast of this I can
though banish'd yet a true-born Englishman


we did observe Cousin Aumerle
how far brought you high Hereford on his way

I brought high Hereford if you call him so
but to the next highway and there I left him

and say what store of parting tears were shed

faith none for me except the northeast wind
awak'd the sleeping rheum and so by chance
did grace our hollow parting with a tear

what said our cousin when you parted with him

'Farewell
and for my heart disdained that my tongue
should so profane the word that taught me craft
to counterfeit oppression of such grief
that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave
marry would the word farewell' have lengthen'd hours
and added years to his short banishment
he should have had a volume of farewells
but since it would not he had none of me

he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
when time shall call him home from banishment
whether our kinsman come to see his friends
ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green
how he did seem to dive into their hearts
with humble and familiar courtesy
what reverence he did throw away on slaves
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
and patient underbearing of his fortune
as twere to banish their affects with him
off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench
a brace of draymen bid God speed him well
and had the tribute of his supple knee
with Thanks my countrymen my loving friends
as were our England in reversion his
and he our subjects' next degree in hope

well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland
expedient manage must be made my liege
ere further leisure yield them further means
for their advantage and your highness' loss

and for our coffers with too great a court
and liberal largess are grown somewhat light
we are enforc'd to farm our royal realm
the revenue whereof shall furnish us
for our affairs in hand If that come short
our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
whereto when they shall know what men are rich
they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
and send them after to supply our wants
for we will make for Ireland presently

Bushy what news

old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord
suddenly taken and hath sent post-haste
to entreat your majesty to visit him

where lies he


now put it God in his physician's mind
to help him to his grave immediately
the lining of his coffers shall make coats
to deck our soldiers for these Irish wars
come gentlemen let's all go visit him
pray God we may make haste and come too late

amen

will the king come that I may breathe my last
in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth

vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
for all in vain comes counsel to his ear

O but they say the tongues of dying men
enforce attention like deep harmony
where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
he that no more must say is listen'd more
than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
more are men's ends mark'd than their lives before
the setting sun and music at the close
as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
writ in remembrance more than things long past
though Richard my life's counsel would not hear
my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear

no it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds
as praises of his state then there are fond
lascivious metres to whose venom sound
the open ear of youth doth always listen
report of fashions in proud Italy
whose manners still our tardy apish nation
limps after in base imitation
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
so it be new there's no respect how vile
that is not quickly buzz'd into his ears
where will doth mutiny with wit's regard
direct not him whose way himself will choose
'Tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose

methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd
and thus expiring do foretell of him
his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
for violent fires soon burn out themselves
small showers last long but sudden storms are short
he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
light vanity insatiate cormorant
consuming means soon preys upon itself
this royal throne of kings this scepter'd isle
this earth of majesty this seat of Mars
this other Eden demi-paradise
this fortress built by Nature for herself
against infection and the hand of war
this happy breed of men this little world
which serves it in the office of a wall
or as a moat defensive to a house
against the envy of less happier lands
this blessed plot this earth this realm this England
this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth
renowned for their deeds as far from home
for Christian service and true chivalry
as is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
of the world's ransom blessed Mary's Son
this land of such dear souls this dear dear land
dear for her reputation through the world
is now leas'd out I die pronouncing it
like to a tenement or pelting farm
England bound in with the triumphant sea
whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
of watery Neptune is now bound in with shame
with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
that England that was wont to conquer others
Ah would the scandal vanish with my life
how happy then were my ensuing death


the king is come deal mildly with his youth
for young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more

how fares our noble uncle Lancaster

what comfort man How is't with aged Gaunt

O how that name befits my composition
old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
for sleeping England long time have I watch'd
watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon
is my strict fast I mean my children's looks
Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave
whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones

can sick men play so nicely with their names

no misery makes sport to mock itself
since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
I mock my name great king to flatter thee

should dying men flatter with those that live

no no men living flatter those that die

thou now a-dying sayst thou flatter'st me

O no thou diest though I the sicker be

I am in health I breathe and see thee ill

ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
wherein thou liest in reputation sick
and thou too careless patient as thou art
committ'st thy anointed body to the cure
of those physicians that first wounded thee
a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
whose compass is no bigger than thy head
and yet incaged in so small a verge
the waste is no whit lesser than thy land
O had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
seen how his son's son should destroy his sons
from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
deposing thee before thou wert possess'd
which art possess'd now to depose thyself
why cousin wert thou regent of the world
it were a shame to let this land by lease
but for thy world enjoying but this land
is it not more than shame to shame it so
thy state of law is bond-slave to the law
and

and thou a lunatic lean-witted fool
presuming on an ague's privilege
dar'st with thy frozen admonition
make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
with fury from his native residence
now by my seat's right royal majesty
wert thou not brother to great Edward's son
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders

O spare me not my brother Edward's son
for that I was his father Edward's son
that blood already like the pelican
hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly carous'd
my brother Gloucester plain well-meaning soul
whom fair befall in heaven mongst happy souls
that thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood
join with the present sickness that I have
and thy unkindness be like crooked age
to crop at once a too-long wither'd flower
live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
these words hereafter thy tormentors be
convey me to my bed then to my grave
love they to live that love and honour have


and let them die that age and sullens have
for both hast thou and both become the grave

I do beseech your majesty impute his words
to wayward sickliness and age in him
he loves you on my life and holds you dear
as Harry Duke of Hereford were he here

right you say true as Hereford's love so his


my liege old Gaunt commends him to your majesty

what says he

nay nothing all is said
his tongue is now a stringless instrument
words life and all old Lancaster hath spent

be York the next that must be bankrupt so
though death be poor it ends a mortal woe

the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
his time is spent our pilgrimage must be
so much for that Now for our Irish wars
we must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns
which live like venom where no venom else
but only they have privilege to live
towards our assistance we do seize to us
the plate coin revenues and moveables
whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd

how long shall I be patient Ah how long
shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
not Gloucester's death nor Hereford's banishment
not Gaunt's rebukes nor England's private wrongs
nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
about his marriage nor my own disgrace
have ever made me sour my patient cheek
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face
I am the last of noble Edward's sons
of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first
in war was never lion rag'd more fierce
in peace was never gentle lamb more mild
than was that young and princely gentleman
his face thou hast for even so look'd he
accomplish'd with the number of thy hours
and not against his friends his noble hand
did win what he did spend and spent not that
which his triumphant father's hand had won
his hands were guilty of no kindred's blood
but bloody with the enemies of his kin
O Richard York is too far gone with grief
or else he never would compare between

why uncle what's the matter

O my liege
pardon me if you please if not I pleas'd
not to be pardon'd am content withal
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
the royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford
is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live
was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true
did not the one deserve to have an heir
is not his heir a well-deserving son
his charters and his customary rights
let not to-morrow then ensue to-day
be not thyself for how art thou a king
but by fair sequence and succession
now afore God God forbid I say true
if you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights
call in the letters-patent that he hath
by his attorneys-general to sue
his livery and deny his offer'd homage
you pluck a thousand dangers on your head
you lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
and prick my tender patience to those thoughts
which honour and allegiance cannot think

think what you will we seize into our hands
his plate his goods his money and his lands

I'll not be by the while my liege farewell
what will ensue hereof there's none can tell
that their events can never fall out good


go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight
bid him repair to us to Ely House
to see this business To-morrow next
we will for Ireland and tis time I trow
and we create in absence of ourself
our uncle York lord governor of England
for he is just and always lov'd us well
come on our queen to-morrow must we part
be merry for our time of stay is short

well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead

and living too for now his son is duke

barely in title not in revenue


my heart is great but it must break with silence
ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue

nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more
that speaks thy words again to do thee harm

tends that thou'dst speak to the Duke of Hereford
if it be so out with it boldly man
quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him

no good at all that I can do for him
unless you call it good to pity him
bereft and gelded of his patrimony

now afore God tis shame such wrongs are borne
in him a royal prince and many more
of noble blood in this declining land
the king is not himself but basely led
merely in hate gainst any of us all
that will the king severely prosecute
'Gainst us our lives our children and our heirs

the commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes
and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fin'd
for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts

and daily new exactions are devis'd
as blanks benevolences and I wot not what
but what o' God's name doth become of this

wars have not wasted it for warr'd he hath not
but basely yielded upon compromise
that which his ancestors achiev'd with blows
more hath he spent in peace than they in wars

the Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm


reproach and dissolution hangeth over him

he hath not money for these Irish wars
his burdenous taxations notwithstanding
but by the robbing of the banish'd duke

his noble kinsman most degenerate king
but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm
we see the wind sit sore upon our sails
and yet we strike not but securely perish

we see the very wrack that we must suffer
and unavoided is the danger now
for suffering so the causes of our wrack

not so even through the hollow eyes of death
ispy life peering but I dare not say

nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours

be confident to speak Northumberland
we three are but thyself and speaking so
thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold

then thus I have from Port le Blanc a bay
in Brittany receiv'd intelligence
that Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham
that late broke from the Duke of Exeter
his brother Archbishop late of Canterbury
sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston
sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint
all these well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine
with eight tall ships three thousand men of war
are making hither with all due expedience
and shortly mean to touch our northern shore
perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
imp out our drooping country's broken wing
redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown
wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
and make high majesty look like itself
away with me in post to Ravenspurgh
but if you faint as fearing to do so
stay and be secret and myself will go

to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear

hold out my horse and I will first be there


madam your majesty is too much sad
you promis'd when you parted with the king
to lay aside life-harming heaviness
and entertain a cheerful disposition

I cannot do it yet I know no cause
why I should welcome such a guest as grief
save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
as my sweet Richard yet again methinks
some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb
is coming towards me and my inward soul
with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves
more than with parting from my lord the king

each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
which show like grief itself but are not so
for sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears
divides one thing entire to many objects
like perspectives which rightly gaz'd upon
show nothing but confusion ey'd awry
distinguish form so your sweet majesty
looking awry upon your lord's departure
finds shapes of grief more than himself to wail
which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows
more than your lord's departure weep not more's not seen
or if it be tis with false sorrow's eye
which for things true weeps things imaginary

it may be so but yet my inward soul
persuades me it is otherwise howe'er it be
I cannot but be sad so heavy sad
as though in thinking on no thought I think
makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink

'Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady

'Tis nothing less conceit is still deriv'd
from some forefather grief mine is not so
for nothing hath begot my something grief
or something hath the nothing that I grieve
'Tis in reversion that I do possess
but what it is that is not yet known what
I cannot name tis nameless woe I wot

God save your majesty and well met gentlemen
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland

why hop'st thou so tis better hope he is
for his designs crave haste his haste good hope
then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd

that he our hope might have retir'd his power
and driven into despair an enemy's hope
who strongly hath set footing in this land
the banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself
and with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd
at Ravenspurgh

now God in heaven forbid

Ah madam tis too true and that is worse
the Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy
with all their powerful friends are fled to him

why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
and all the rest of the revolted faction traitors

we have whereupon the Earl of Worcester
hath broke his staff resign'd his stewardship
and all the household servants fled with him
to Bolingbroke

so Green thou art the midwife to my woe
and Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir
now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
and I a gasping new-deliver'd mother
have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd

despair not madam

who shall hinder me
with cozening hope he is a flatterer
a parasite a keeper-back of death
who gently would dissolve the bands of life
which false hope lingers in extremity


here comes the Duke of York

with signs of war about his aged neck
O full of careful business are his looks
uncle for God's sake speak comfortable words

should I do so I should belie my thoughts
comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth
where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
your husband he is gone to save far off
whilst others come to make him lose at home
here am I left to underprop his land
who weak with age cannot support myself
now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him


my lord your son was gone before I came

he was Why so go all which way it will
the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold
and will I fear revolt on Hereford's side
sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester
bid her send me presently a thousand pound
hold take my ring

my lord I had forgot to tell your lordship
to-day as I came by I called there
but I shall grieve you to report the rest

what is't knave

an hour before I came the duchess died
God for his mercy what a tide of woes
comes rushing on this woeful land at once
I know not what to do I would to God
so my untruth had not provok'd him to it
the king had cut off my head with my brother's
what are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland
how shall we do for money for these wars
come sister cousin I would say pray pardon me
go fellow get thee home provide some carts
and bring away the armour that is there

gentlemen will you go muster men If I know
how or which way to order these affairs
thus thrust disorderly into my hands
never believe me Both are my kinsmen
the one is my sovereign whom both my oath
and duty bids defend the other again
is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong'd
whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
I'll dispose of you Gentlemen go muster up your men
and meet me presently at Berkeley Castle
I should to Plashy too
but time will not permit All is uneven
and every thing is left at six and seven


the wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland
but none returns For us to levy power
proportionable to the enemy
is all unpossible

besides our nearness to the king in love
is near the hate of those love not the king

and that's the wavering commons for their love
lies in their purses and whoso empties them
by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate


if judgment lie in them then so do we
because we ever have been near the king

well I'll for refuge straight to Bristol Castle
the Earl of Wiltshire is already there

thither will I with you for little office
will the hateful commons perform for us
except like curs to tear us all to pieces
will you go along with us

no I will to Ireland to his majesty
farewell if heart's presages be not vain
we three here part that ne'er shall meet again

that's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke

alas poor duke the task he undertakes
where one on his side fights thousands will fly
farewell at once for once for all and ever

well we may meet again

I fear me never


how far is it my lord to Berkeley now

believe me noble lord
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire
these high wild hills and rough uneven ways
draw out our miles and make them wearisome
but yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
making the hard way sweet and delectable
but I bethink me what a weary way
from Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
in Ross and Willoughby wanting your company
the tediousness and process of my travel
but theirs is sweeten'd with the hope to have
the present benefit which I possess
and hope to joy is little less in joy
than hope enjoy'd by this the weary lords
shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
by sight of what I have your noble company

of much less value is my company
than your good words But who comes here


it is my son young Harry Percy
sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever
Harry how fares your uncle

I had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you

why is he not with the queen
no my good lord he hath forsook the court
broken his staff of office and dispers'd
the household of the king

what was his reason
he was not so resolv'd when last we spake together

because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
but he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh
to offer service to the Duke of Hereford
and sent me over by Berkeley to discover
what power the Duke of York had levied there
then with direction to repair to Ravenspurgh

have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy

no my good lord for that is not forgot
which ne'er I did remember to my knowledge
I never in my life did look on him
then learn to know him now this is the duke

my gracious lord I tender you my service
such as it is being tender raw and young
which elder days shall ripen and confirm
to more approved service and desert

I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure
I count myself in nothing else so happy
as in a soul remembering my good friends
and as my fortune ripens with thy love
it shall be still thy true love's recompense
my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it

how far is it to Berkeley and what stir
keeps good old York there with his men of war

there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
mann'd with three hundred men as I have heard
none else of name and noble estimate


here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby
bloody with spurring fiery-red with haste

welcome my lords I wot your love pursues
a banish'd traitor all my treasury
is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd
shall be your love and labour's recompense

your presence makes us rich most noble lord

and far surmounts our labour to attain it

evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
which till my infant fortune comes to years
stands for my bounty But who comes here

it is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess

my lord of Hereford my message is to you

my lord my answer is to Lancaster
and I am come to seek that name in England
and I must find that title in your tongue
before I make reply to aught you say

mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
to raze one title of your honour out
to you my lord I come what lord you will
from the most gracious regent of this land
the Duke of York to know what pricks you on
to take advantage of the absent time
and fright our native peace with self-born arms


I shall not need transport my words by you
my noble uncle


show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
whose duty is deceivable and false

my gracious uncle

tut tut
Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
I am no traitor's uncle and that word grace'
in an ungracious mouth is but profane
why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
dar'd once to touch a dust of England's ground
but then more why why have they dar'd to march
so many miles upon her peaceful bosom
frighting her pale-fac'd villages with war
and ostentation of despised arms
com'st thou because the anointed king is hence
and in my loyal bosom lies his power
were I but now the lord of such hot youth
as when brave Gaunt thy father and myself
rescu'd the Black Prince that young Mars of men
from forth the ranks of many thousand French
O then how quickly should this arm of mine
now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
and minister correction to thy fault

my gracious uncle let me know my fault
on what condition stands it and wherein

even in condition of the worst degree
in gross rebellion and detested treason
thou art a banish'd man and here art come
before the expiration of thy time
in braving arms against thy sovereign

as I was banish'd I was banish'd Hereford
and noble uncle I beseech your Grace
look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
you are my father for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive O then my father
will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
to upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born
if that my cousin king be King of England
it must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster
you have a son Aumerle my noble kinsman
had you first died and he been thus trod down
he should have found his uncle Gaunt a father
to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
I am denied to sue my livery here
and yet my letters-patent give me leave
my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold
and these and all are all amiss employ'd
what would you have me do I am a subject
and therefore personally I lay my claim
to my inheritance of free descent

the noble duke hath been too much abus'd

it stands your Grace upon to do him right

base men by his endowments are made great

my lords of England let me tell you this
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
and labour'd all I could to do him right
but in this kind to come in braving arms
be his own carver and cut out his way
to find out right with wrong it may not be
and you that do abet him in this kind
cherish rebellion and are rebels all

the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
we all have strongly sworn to give him aid
and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath

well well I see the issue of these arms
I cannot mend it I must needs confess
because my power is weak and all ill left
but if I could by him that gave me life
I would attach you all and make you stoop
unto the sovereign mercy of the king
but since I cannot be it known to you
I do remain as neuter So fare you well
unless you please to enter in the castle
and there repose you for this night

an offer uncle that we will accept
but we must win your Grace to go with us
to Bristol Castle which they say is held
by Bushy Bagot and their complices
the caterpillars of the commonwealth

it may be I will go with you but yet I'll pause
for I am loath to break our country's laws
nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
things past redress are now with me past care


my Lord of Salisbury we have stay'd ten days
and hardly kept our countrymen together
and yet we hear no tidings from the king
therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell

stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman
the king reposeth all his confidence in thee

'Tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
the bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
the pale-fac'd moon looks bloody on the earth
rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
the one in fear to lose what they enjoy
the other to enjoy by rage and war
these signs forerun the death or fall of kings
farewell our countrymen are gone and fled
as well assur'd Richard their king is dead


Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
fall to the base earth from the firmament
thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
and crossly to thy good all fortune goes


bring forth these men
Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls
with too much urging your pernicious lives
for twere no charity yet to wash your blood
from off my hands here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths
you have misled a prince a royal king
a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
by you unhappied and disfigur'd clean
you have in manner with your sinful hours
made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
broke the possession of a royal bed
and stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
myself a prince by fortune of my birth
near to the king in blood and near in love
till you did make him misinterpret me
have stoop'd my neck under your injuries
and sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds
eating the bitter bread of banishment
whilst you have fed upon my signories
from mine own windows torn my household coat
raz'd out my impress leaving me no sign
save men's opinions and my living blood
to show the world I am a gentleman
this and much more much more than twice all this
condemns you to the death See them deliver'd over
to execution and the hand of death

more welcome is the stroke of death to me
than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewell

my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
and plague injustice with the pains of hell

my Lord Northumberland see them dispatch'd

uncle you say the queen is at your house
for God's sake fairly let her be entreated
tell her I send to her my kind commends

a gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
with letters of your love to her at large

thanks gentle uncle Come lords away
to fight with Glendower and his complices
awhile to work and after holiday


barkloughly Castle call they this at hand

yea my lord How brooks your Grace the air
after your late tossing on the breaking seas

needs must I like it well I weep for joy
to stand upon my kingdom once again
dear earth I do salute thee with my hand
though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs
as a long-parted mother with her child
so weeping smiling greet I thee my earth
and do thee favour with my royal hands
feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth
nor with thy sweets comfort his revenous sense
but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
and heavy-gaited toads lie in their way
doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
which with usurping steps do trample thee
yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder
whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies
mock not my senseless conjuration lords
this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
prove armed soldiers ere her native king
shall falter under foul rebellion's arms

fear not my lord that power that made you king
the means that heaven yields must be embrac'd
and not neglected else if heaven would
and we will not heaven's offer we refuse
the proffer'd means of succour and redress

he means my lord that we are too remiss
whilst Bolingbroke through our security
grows strong and great in substance and in friends

discomfortable cousin know'st thou not
that when the searching eye of heaven is hid
behind the globe and lights the lower world
then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
in murders and in outrage bloody here
but when from under this terrestrial ball
he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
and darts his light through every guilty hole
then murders treasons and detested sins
the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs
so when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke
who all this while hath revell'd in the night
whilst we were wandering with the antipodes
shall see us rising in our throne the east
his treasons will sit blushing in his face
not able to endure the sight of day
but self-affrighted tremble at his sin
not all the water in the rough rude sea
can wash the balm from an anointed king
the breath of worldly men cannot depose
the deputy elected by the Lord
for every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
a glorious angel then if angels fight
weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right

welcome my lord how far off lies your power

than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue
and bids me speak of nothing but despair
one day too late I fear me noble lord
hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
O call back yesterday bid time return
and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
to-day to-day unhappy day too late
o'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state
for all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead
are gone to Bolingbroke dispers'd and fled

comfort my liege why looks your Grace so pale

but now the blood of twenty thousand men
did triumph in my face and they are fled
and till so much blood thither come again
have I not reason to look pale and dead
all souls that will be safe fly from my side
for time hath set a blot upon my pride
comfort my liege remember who you are

I had forgot myself Am I not king
awake thou sluggard majesty thou sleepest
is not the king's name twenty thousand names
arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
at thy great glory Look not to the ground
ye favourites of a king are we not high
high be our thoughts I know my uncle York
hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here


more health and happiness betide my liege
than can my care-tun'd tongue deliver him

mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd
the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
and what loss is it to be rid of care
greater he shall not be if he serve God
we'll serve him too and be his fellow so
revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
they break their faith to God as well as us
cry woe destruction ruin loss decay
the worst is death and death will have his day

glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
to bear the tidings of calamity
like an unseasonable stormy day
which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
as if the world were all dissolv'd to tears
so high above his limits swells the rage
of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land
with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
white-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
against thy majesty and boys with women's voices
strive to speak big and clap their female joints
in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
of double-fatal yew against thy state
yea distaff-women manage rusty bills
against thy seat both young and old rebel
and all goes worse than I have power to tell

too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill
where is the Earl of Wiltshire where is Bagot
what is become of Bushy where is Green
that they have let the dangerous enemy
measure our confines with such peaceful steps
if we prevail their heads shall pay for it
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke

peace have they made with him indeed my lord

O villains vipers damn'd without redemption
dogs easily won to fawn on any man
snakes in my heart-blood warm'd that sting my heart
three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas
upon their spotted souls for this offence

sweet love I see changing his property
turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
again uncurse their souls their peace is made
with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
and lie full low grav'd in the hollow ground

is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead

yea all of them at Bristol lost their heads

where is the duke my father with his power

no matter where Of comfort no man speak
let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
and yet not so for what can we bequeath
save our deposed bodies to the ground
our lands our lives and all are Bolingbroke's
and nothing can we call our own but death
and that small model of the barren earth
which serves as paste and cover to our bones
for God's sake let us sit upon the ground
and tell sad stories of the death of kings
how some have been depos'd some slain in war
some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd
some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd
all murder'd for within the hollow crown
that rounds the mortal temples of a king
keeps Death his court and there the antick sits
scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
allowing him a breath a little scene
to monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks
infusing him with self and vain conceit
as if this flesh which walls about our life
comes at the last and with a little pin
bores through his castle wall and farewell king
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
with solemn reverence throw away respect
tradition form and ceremonious duty
for you have but mistook me all this while
I live with bread like you feel want
taste grief need friends subjected thus
how can you say to me I am a king

my lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes
but presently prevent the ways to wail
to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
and so your follies fight against yourself
fear and be slain no worse can come to fight
and fight and die is death destroying death
where fearing dying pays death servile breath

and learn to make a body of a limb

thou chid'st me well Proud Boling broke I come
to change blows with thee for our day of doom
this ague-fit of fear is over-blown
an easy task it is to win our own
say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power
speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour

men judge by the complexion of the sky
the state and inclination of the day
so may you by my dull and heavy eye
my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
I play the torturer by small and small
to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke
and all your northern castles yielded up
and all your southern gentlemen in arms
upon his party
thou hast said enough


beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
of that sweet way I was in to despair
what say you now What comfort have we now
by heaven I'll hate him everlastingly
that bids me be of comfort any more
go to Flint Castle there I'll pine away
a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey
that power I have discharge and let them go
to ear the land that hath some hope to grow
for I have none let no man speak again
to alter this for counsel is but vain

my liege one word

he does me double wrong
that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
from Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day


so that by this intelligence we learn
the Welshmen are dispers'd and Salisbury
is gone to meet the king who lately landed
with some few private friends upon this coast

the news is very fair and good my lord
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head

it would beseem the Lord Northumberland
to say King Richard alack the heavy day
when such a sacred king should hide his head

your Grace mistakes only to be brief
left I his title out

the time hath been
have been so brief with you to shorten you
for taking so the head your whole head's length

mistake not uncle further than you should

take not good cousin further than you should
lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads

I know it uncle and oppose not myself
against their will But who comes here

welcome Harry what will not this castle yield

the castle royally is mann'd my lord
against thy entrance

royally
why it contains no king

it doth contain a king King Richard lies
within the limits of yon lime and stone
and with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury
sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman
of holy reverence who I cannot learn

O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle

noble lord
go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver
Henry Bolingbroke
on both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
to his most royal person hither come
even at his feet to lay my arms and power
provided that my banishment repeal'd
and lands restor'd again be freely granted
and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen
the which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
the fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land
my stooping duty tenderly shall show
go signify as much while here we march
upon the grassy carpet of this plain
let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum
that from the castle's totter'd battlements
our fair appointments may be well perus'd
methinks King Richard and myself should meet
with no less terror than the elements
of fire and water when their thundering shock
at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
be he the fire I'll be the yielding water
the rage be his while on the earth I rain
my waters on the earth and not on him
march on and mark King Richard how he looks

see see King Richard doth himself appear
as doth the blushing discontented sun
from out the fiery portal of the east
when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
to dim his glory and to stain the track
of his bright passage to the occident

yet looks he like a king behold his eye
as bright as is the eagle's lightens forth
controlling majesty alack alack for woe
that any harm should stain so fair a show

we are amaz'd and thus long have we stood
to watch the fearful bending of thy knee
because we thought ourself thy lawful king
and if we be how dare thy joints forget
to pay their awful duty to our presence
if we be not show us the hand of God
for well we know no hand of blood and bone
can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
unless he do profane steal or usurp
and though you think that all as you have done
have torn their souls by turning them from us
and we are barren and bereft of friends
yet know my master God omnipotent
is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
armies of pestilence and they shall strike
your children yet unborn and unbegot
that lift your vassal hands against my head
and threat the glory of my precious crown
tell Bolingbroke for yond methinks he is
that every stride he makes upon my land
is dangerous treason he is come to open
the purple testament of bleeding war
but ere the crown he looks for live in peace
ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
shall ill become the flower of England's face
to scarlet indignation and bedew
her pastures' grass with faithful English blood

the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
should so with civil and uncivil arms
be rush'd upon Thy thrice-noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
and by the honourable tomb he swears
that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones
and by the royalties of both your bloods
currents that spring from one most gracious head
and by the buried hand of war-like Gaunt
and by the worth and honour of himself
comprising all that may be sworn or said
his coming hither hath no further scope
than for his lineal royalties and to beg
enfranchisement immediate on his knees
which on thy royal party granted once
his glittering arms he will commend to rust
to faithful service of your majesty
this swears he as he is a prince is just
and as I am a gentleman I credit him

Northumberland say thus the king returns
his noble cousin is right welcome hither
and all the number of his fair demands
shall be accomplish'd without contradiction
with all the gracious utterance thou hast
speak to his gentle hearing kind commends

we do debase ourself cousin do we not
to look so poorly and to speak so fair
shall we call back Northumberland and send
defiance to the traitor and so die

no good my lord let's fight with gentle words
till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords

that laid the sentence of dread banishment
on yond proud man should take it off again
with words of sooth O that I were as great
as is my grief or lesser than my name
or that I could forget what I have been
or not remember what I must be now
swell'st thou proud heart I'll give thee scope to beat
since foes have scope to beat both thee and me

Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke

what must the king do now Must he submit
the king shall do it must he be depos'd
the king shall be contented must he lose
the name of king o' God's name let it go
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads
my gorgeous palace for a hermitage
my gay apparel for an almsman's gown
my figur'd goblets for a dish of wood
my subjects for a pair of carved saints
and my large kingdom for a little grave
a little little grave an obscure grave
or I'll be buried in the king's highway
some way of common trade where subjects' feet
may hourly trample on their sovereign's head
for on my heart they tread now whilst I live
and buried once why not upon my head
Aumerle thou weep'st my tender-hearted cousin
we'll make foul weather with despised tears
our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
and make a dearth in this revolting land
or shall we play the wantons with our woes
and make some pretty match with shedding tears
as thus to drop them still upon one place
till they have fretted us a pair of graves
within the earth and there inlaid There lies
two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes
would not this ill do well Well well I see
most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland
what says King Bolingbroke will his majesty
give Richard leave to live till Richard die
you make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay

my lord in the base court he doth attend
to speak with you may't please you to come down

down down I come like glistering Phaethon
wanting the manage of unruly jades
in the base court Base court where kings grow base
to come at traitors' calls and do them grace
in the base court Come down Down court down king
for night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing


what says his majesty

sorrow and grief of heart
yet he is come


stand all apart
and show fair duty to his majesty

my gracious lord

fair cousin you debase your princely knee
to make the base earth proud with kissing it
me rather had my heart might feel your love
than my unpleas'd eye see your courtesy
up cousin up your heart is up I know
thus high at least although your knee be low

my gracious lord I come but for mine own

your own is yours and I am yours and all

as my true service shall deserve your love

well you deserve they well deserve to have
that know the strong'st and surest way to get
uncle give me your hand nay dry your eyes
tears show their love but want their remedies
cousin I am too young to be your father
though you are old enough to be my heir
what you will have I'll give and willing too
for do we must what force will have us do
set on towards London Cousin is it so

yea my good lord

then I must not say no


what sport shall we devise here in this garden
to drive away the heavy thought of care
madam we'll play at bowls

'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
and that my fortune runs against the bias

madam we'll dance

my legs can keep no measure in delight
when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
therefore no dancing girl some other sport

madam we'll tell tales

of sorrow or of joy

of either madam

of neither girl
for if of joy being altogether wanting
or if of grief being altogether had
it adds more sorrow to my want of joy
for what I have I need not to repeat
and what I want it boots not to complain

madam I'll sing

'Tis well that thou hast cause
but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep

I could weep madam would it do you good

and I could sing would weeping do me good
and never borrow any tear of thee
but stay here come the gardeners
let's step into the shadow of these trees
my wretchedness unto a row of pins
they'll talk of state for every one doth so
against a change woe is forerun with woe
go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
which like unruly children make their sire
stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
give some supportance to the bending twigs
go thou and like an executioner
cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
that look too lofty in our commonwealth
all must be even in our government
you thus employ'd I will go root away
the noisome weeds that without profit suck
the soil's fertility from wholesome flowers

why should we in the compass of a pale
keep law and form and due proportion
showing as in a model our firm estate
when our sea-walled garden the whole land
is full of weeds her fairest flowers chok'd up
her fruit-trees all unprun'd her hedges ruin'd
her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs

hold thy peace
he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
the weeds that his broad-spreading leaves did shelter
that seem'd in eating him to hold him up
are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green

what are they dead

they are and Bolingbroke
hath seiz'd the wasteful king O what pity is it
that he hath not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
as we this garden We at time of year
do wound the bark the skin of our fruit-trees
lest being over-proud with sap and blood
with too much riches it confound itself
had he done so to great and growing men
their fruits of duty superfluous branches
we lop away that bearing boughs may live
had he done so himself had borne the crown
which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down

what think you then the king shall be depos'd

depress'd he is already and depos'd
'Tis doubt he will be letters came last night
to a dear friend of the good Duke of York's
that tell black tidings

O I am press'd to death through want of speaking

thou old Adam's likeness set to dress this garden
how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
what Eve what serpent hath suggested thee
to make a second fall of cursed man
why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd
divine his downfall Say where when and how
cam'st thou by these ill tidings speak thou wretch

pardon me madam little joy have I
to breathe these news yet what I say is true
king Richard he is in the mighty hold
of Bolingbroke their fortunes both are weigh'd
in your lord's scale is nothing but himself
and some few vanities that make him light
but in the balance of great Bolingbroke
besides himself are all the English peers
and with that odds he weighs King Richard down
post you to London and you'll find it so
I speak no more than every one doth know

nimble mischance that art so light of foot
doth not thy embassage belong to me
and am I last that knows it O thou think'st
to serve me last that I may longest keep
to meet at London London's king in woe
what was I born to this that my sad look
should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke
gardener for telling me these news of woe
pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow


poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
I would my skill were subject to thy curse
here did she fall a tear here in this place
I'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
in the remembrance of a weeping queen

call forth Bagot
now Bagot freely speak thy mind
what thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death
who wrought it with the king and who perform'd
the bloody office of his timeless end
then set before my face the Lord Aumerle

cousin stand forth and look upon that man

my Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue
scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd
in that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted
I heard you say Is not my arm of length
that reacheth from the restful English court
as far as Calais to my uncle's head
amongst much other talk that very time
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
the offer of a hundred thousand crowns
than Bolingbroke's return to England
adding withal how blest this land would be
in this your cousin's death

princes and noble lords
what answer shall I make to this base man
on equal terms to give him chastisement
either I must or have mine honour soil'd
with the attainder of his slanderous lips
there is my gage the manual seal of death
that marks thee out for hell I say thou liest
and will maintain what thou hast said is false
in thy heart-blood though being all too base
to stain the temper of my knightly sword

Bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up

excepting one I would he were the best
in all this presence that hath mov'd me so

if that thy valour stand on sympathies
there is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine
by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st
I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spak'st it
that thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death
and I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
where it was forged with my rapier's point

thou dar'st not coward live to see that day

now by my soul I would it were this hour

Fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this

Aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
in this appeal as thou art all unjust
and that thou art so there I throw my gage
to prove it on thee to the extremest point
of mortal breathing seize it if thou dar'st

and if I do not may my hands rot off
and never brandish more revengeful steel
over the glittering helmet of my foe

and spur thee on with full as many lies
as may be holla'd in thy treacherous ear
from sun to sun there is my honour's pawn
engage it to the trial if thou dar'st

who sets me else by heaven I'll throw at all
I have a thousand spirits in one breast
to answer twenty thousand such as you

my Lord Fitzwater I do remember well
the very time Aumerle and you did talk

'Tis very true you were in presence then
and you can witness with me this is true

as false by heaven as heaven itself is true

Surrey thou best

that he shall lie so heavy on my sword
that it shall render vengeance and revenge
till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
in earth as quiet as thy father's skull
in proof whereof there is my honour's pawn
engage it to the trial if thou dar'st

how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
if I dare eat or drink or breathe or live
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness
and spit upon him whilst I say he lies
and lies and lies there is my bond of faith
to tie thee to my strong correction
as I intend to thrive in this new world
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
besides I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
that thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men
to execute the noble duke at Calais

that Norfolk lies here do I throw down this
if he may be repeal'd to try his honour

these differences shall all rest under gage
till Norfolk be repeal'd repeal'd he shall be
and though mine enemy restor'd again
to all his lands and signories when he's return'd
against Aumerle we will enforce his trial

that honourable day shall ne'er be seen
many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
for Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field
streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
against black pagans Turks and Saracens
and toil'd with works of war retir'd himself
to Italy and there at Venice gave
his body to that pleasant country's earth
and his pure soul unto his captain Christ
under whose colours he had fought so long
why bishop is Norfolk dead

as surely as I live my lord

sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
of good old Abraham Lords appellants
your differences shall all rest under gage
till we assign you to your days of trial


great Duke of Lancaster I come to thee
from plume-pluck'd Richard who with willing soul
adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
to the possession of thy royal hand
ascend his throne descending now from him
and long live Henry of that name the fourth

in God's name I'll ascend the regal throne

worst in this royal presence may I speak
yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
would God that any in this noble presence
were enough noble to be upright judge
of noble Richard then true noblesse would
learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
what subject can give sentence on his king
and who sits here that is not Richard's subject
thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear
although apparent guilt be seen in them
and shall the figure of God's majesty
his captain steward deputy elect
anointed crowned planted many years
be judg'd by subject and inferior breath
and he himself not present O forfend it God
that in a Christian climate souls refin'd
should show so heinous black obscene a deed
I speak to subjects and a subject speaks
stirr'd up by God thus boldly for his king
is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king
and if you crown him let me prophesy
the blood of English shall manure the ground
and future ages groan for this foul act
peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels
and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
disorder horror fear and mutiny
shall here inhabit and this land be call'd
the field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls
O if you rear this house against this house
it will the woefullest division prove
that ever fell upon this cursed earth
prevent it resist it let it not be so
lest child child's children cry against you woe

well have you argu'd sir and for your pains
of capital treason we arrest you here
my Lord of Westminster be it your charge
may it please you lords to grant the commons' suit

fetch hither Richard that in common view
he may surrender so we shall proceed
without suspicion

I will be his conduct


lords you that here are under our arrest
procure your sureties for your days of answer


little are we beholding to your love
and little look'd for at your helping hands


alack why am I sent for to a king
before I have shook off the regal thoughts
to insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs
give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
to this submission Yet I well remember
the favours of these men were they not mine
did they not sometime cry All haill' to me
so Judas did to Christ but he in twelve
found truth in all but one I in twelve thousand none
God save the king Will no man say amen
am I both priest and clerk well then amen
God save the king although I be not he
and yet amen if heaven do think him me
to do what service am I sent for hither

to do that office of thine own good will
which tired majesty did make thee offer
the resignation of thy state and crown
to Henry Bolingbroke

give me the crown Here cousin seize the crown
on this side my hand and on that side thine
now is this golden crown like a deep well
that owes two buckets filling one another
the emptier ever dancing in the air
the other down unseen and full of water
that bucket down and full of tears am I
drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high

I thought you had been willing to resign

my crown I am but still my griefs are mine
you may my glories and my state depose
but not my griefs still am I king of those

part of your cares you give me with your crown

your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
my care is loss of care by old care done
your care is gain of care by new care won
they tend the crown yet still with me they stay

are you contented to resign the crown

ay no no ay for I must nothing be
therefore no no for I resign to thee
now mark me how I will undo myself
I give this heavy weight from off my head
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
the pride of kingly sway from out my heart
with mine own tears I wash away my balm
with mine own hands I give away my crown
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
with mine own breath release all duteous rites
all pomp and majesty I do forswear
my manors rents revenues I forego
my acts decrees and statutes I deny
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me
God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee
and thou with all pleas'd that hast all achiev'd
long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit
and soon lie Richard in an earthy pit
God save King Henry unking'd Richard says
and send him many years of sunshine days
what more remains

no more but that you read
these accusations and these grievous crimes
committed by your person and your followers
against the state and profit of this land
that by confessing them the souls of men
may deem that you are worthily depos'd

must I do so and must I ravel out
my weav'd-up follies Gentle Northumberland
if thy offences were upon record
would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
to read a lecture of them If thou wouldst
containing the deposing of a king
and cracking the strong warrant of an oath
mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven
nay all of you that stand and look upon me
whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
showing an outward pity yet you Pilates
have here deliver'd me to my sour cross
and water cannot wash away your sin

my lord dispatch read o'er these articles

mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see
and yet salt water blinds them not so much
but they can see a sort of traitors here
nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself
I find myself a traitor with the rest
for I have given here my soul's consent
to undeck the pompous body of a king
proud majesty a subject state a peasant

my lord

no lord of thine thou haught insulting man
nor no man's lord I have no name no title
no not that name was given me at the font
but tis usurp'd alack the heavy day
that I have worn so many winters out
and know not now what name to call myself
O that I were a mockery king of snow
standing before the sun of Bolingbroke
to melt myself away in water-drops
good king great king and yet not greatly good
an if my word be sterling yet in England
let it command a mirror hither straight
that it may show me what a face I have
since it is bankrupt of his majesty



read o'er this paper while the glass doth come

fiend thou torment'st me ere I come to hell

urge it no more my Lord Northumberland

the commons will not then be satisfied

they shall be satisfied I'll read enough
when I do see the very book indeed
where all my sins are writ and that's myself


give me the glass and therein will I read
no deeper wrinkles yet Hath sorrow struck
so many blows upon this face of mine
and made no deeper wounds O flattering glass
thou dost beguile me Was this face the face
that every day under his household roof
did keep ten thousand men Was this the face
that like the sun did make beholders wink
was this the face that fac'd so many follies
and was at last out-fac'd by Bolingbroke
a brittle glory shineth in this face
as brittle as the glory is the face

for there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers
mark silent king the moral of this sport

how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face

the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
the shadow of your face

say that again
the shadow of my sorrow Ha let's see
and these external manners of laments
are merely shadows to the unseen grief
that swells with silence in the tortur'd soul
there lies the substance and I thank thee king
for thy great bounty that not only giv'st
me cause to wail but teachest me the way
how to lament the cause I'll beg one boon
and then be gone and trouble you no more
shall I obtain it

name it fair cousin

'Fair cousin I am greater than a king
for when I was a king my flatterers
were then but subjects being now a subject
I have a king here to my flatterer
being so great I have no need to beg

yet ask
and shall I have

you shall

then give me leave to go

whither

whither you will so I were from your sights

go some of you convey him to the Tower

O good convey conveyers are you all
that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall


on Wednesday next we solemnly set down
our coronation lords prepare yourselves

a woeful pageant have we here beheld

the woe's to come the children yet unborn
shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn

you holy clergymen is there no plot
to rid the realm of this pernicious blot

my lord
before I freely speak my mind herein
you shall not only take the sacrament
to bury mine intents but also to effect
whatever I shall happen to devise
I see your brows are full of discontent
your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
come home with me to supper I will lay
a plot shall show us all a merry day

this way the king will come this is the way
to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke
here let us rest if this rebellious earth
have any resting for her true king's queen


but soft but see or rather do not see
my fair rose wither yet look up behold
that you in pity may dissolve to dew
and wash him fresh again with true-love tears
Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand
thou map of honour thou King Richard's tomb
and not King Richard thou most beauteous inn
why should hard-favour'd grief be lodg'd in thee

when triumph is become an alehouse guest

join not with grief fair woman do not so
to make my end too sudden learn good soul
from which awak'd the truth of what we are
shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet
to grim Necessity and he and I
will keep a league till death Hie thee to France
and cloister thee in some religious house
our holy lives must win a new world's crown
which our profane hours here have stricken down

what is my Richard both in shape and mind
transform'd and weaken'd Hath Bolingbroke depos'd
thine intellect hath he been in thy heart
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
to be o'erpower'd and wilt thou pupil-like
take thy correction mildly kiss the rod
and fawn on rage with base humility
which art a lion and a king of beasts

a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
good sometime queen prepare thee hence for France
think I am dead and that even here thou tak'st
as from my death-bed my last living leave
in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
of woeful ages long ago betid
and ere thou bid good night to quit their grief
tell thou the lamentable tale of me
and send the hearers weeping to their beds
for why the senseless brands will sympathize
the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
and in compassion weep the fire out
and some will mourn in ashes some coal-black
for the deposing of a rightful king


my lord the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd
you must to Pomfret not unto the Tower
and madam there is order ta'en for you

Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
the mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne
the time shall not be many hours of age
more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
shall break into corruption Thou shalt think
though he divide the realm and give thee half
it is too little helping him to all
and he shall think that thou which know'st the way
to plant unrightful kings wilt know again
being ne'er so little urg'd another way
to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
the love of wicked friends converts to fear
that fear to hate and hate turns one or both
to worthy danger and deserved death

my guilt be on my head and there an end
take leave and part for you must part forthwith

a two-fold marriage twixt my crown and me
and then betwixt me and my married wife
let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
and yet not so for with a kiss twas made
part us Northumberland I towards the north
where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
my wife to France from whence set forth in pomp
she came adorned hither like sweet May
sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day

and must we be divided must we part

ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart

banish us both and send the king with me

that were some love but little policy

then whither he goes thither let me go
so two together weeping make one woe
weep thou for me in France I for thee here
better far off than near be ne'er the near
go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans

so longest way shall have the longest moans

twice for one step I'll groan the way being short
and piece the way out with a heavy heart
come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief
since wedding it thero is such length in grief
one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart


give me mine own again twere no good part
to take on me to keep and kill thy heart

so now I have mine own again be gone

we make woe wanton with this fond delay
once more adieu the rest let sorrow say


my lord you told me you would tell the rest
when weeping made you break the story off
of our two cousins coming into London

where did I leave

at that sad stop my lord
where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head

then as I said the duke great Bolingbroke
mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
which his aspiring rider seem'd to know
with slow but stately pace kept on his course
you would have thought the very windows spake
so many greedy looks of young and old
through casements darted their desiring eyes
upon his visage and that all the walls
with painted imagery had said at once
'Jesu preserve thee welcome Bolingbroke
whilst he from one side to the other turning
bare-headed lower than his proud steed's neck
bespake them thus I thank you countrymen
and thus still doing thus he pass'd along

alack poor Richard where rode he the whilst

as in a theatre the eyes of men
after a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage
are idly bent on him that enters next
thinking his prattle to be tedious
even so or with much more contempt men's eyes
did scowl on Richard no man cried God save him
but dust was thrown upon his sacred head
which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
his face still combating with tears and smiles
the badges of his grief and patience
that had not God for some strong purpose steel'd
the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
and barbarism itself have pitied him
but heaven hath a hand in these events
to whose high will we bound our calm contents
to Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
whose state and honour I for aye allow

here comes my son Aumerle

Aumerle that was
but that is lost for being Richard's friend
and madam you must call him Rutland now
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
and lasting fealty to the new-made king

welcome my son who are the violets now
that strew the green lap of the new come spring

madam I know not nor I greatly care not
God knows I had as lief be none as one

well bear you well in this new spring of time
lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime
what news from Oxford hold those justs and triumphs

for aught I know my lord they do

you will be there I know

if God prevent it not I purpose so

what seal is that that hangs without thy bosom
yea look'st thou pale let me see the writing
my lord tis nothing

no matter then who sees it
I will be satisfied let me see the writing

I do beseech your Grace to pardon me
it is a matter of small consequence
which for some reasons I would not have seen

which for some reasons sir I mean to see
I fear I fear

what should you fear
'Tis nothing but some bond he's enter'd into
for gay apparel gainst the triumph day

bound to himself what doth he with a bond
that he is bound to Wife thou art a fool
boy let me see the writing
I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it

I will be satisfied let me see it I say

treason foul treason villain traitor slave

what is the matter my lord

ho who is within there


saddle my horse

God for his mercy what treachery is here

why what is it my lord

give me my boots I say saddle my horse
now by mine honour by my life my troth


what's the matter

peace foolish woman

I will not peace What is the matter Aumerle

good mother be content it is no more
than my poor life must answer

thy life answer

bring me my boots I will unto the king


strike him Aumerle Poor boy thou art amaz'd




give me my boots I say

why York what wilt thou do
wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
have we more sons or are we like to have
is not my teeming date drunk up with time
and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
and rob me of a happy mother's name
is he not like thee is he not thine own

thou fond mad woman
wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament
and interchangeably set down their hands
to kill the king at Oxford

he shall be none

away fond woman were he twenty times
my son I would appeach him

hadst thou groan'd for him
as I have done thou'dst be more pitiful
but now I know thy mind thou dost suspect
that I have been disloyal to thy bed
and that he is a bastard not thy son
sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind
he is as like thee as a man may be
not like to me nor any of my kin
and yet I love him

make way unruly woman


after Aumerle Mount thee upon his horse
spur post and get before him to the king
I'll not be long behind though I be old
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York
and never will I rise up from the ground
till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee Away be gone


can no man tell of my unthrifty son
'Tis full three months since I did see him last
if any plague hang over us tis he
I would to God my lords he might be found
inquire at London mongst the taverns there
for there they say he daily doth frequent
with unrestrained loose companions
even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
and beat our watch and rob our passengers
while he young wanton and effeminate boy
takes on the point of honour to support
so dissolute a crew

and told him of these triumphs held at Oxford

and what said the gallant

his answer was he would unto the stews
and from the common'st creature pluck a glove
and wear it as a favour and with that
he would unhorse the lustiest challenger

as dissolute as desperate yet through both
I see some sparkles of a better hope
which elder days may happily bring forth
but who comes here


where is the king

what means
our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly
God save your Grace I do beseech your majesty
to have some conference with your Grace alone

withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone

what is the matter with our cousin now

for ever may my knees grow to the earth
my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
unless a pardon ere I rise or speak

intended or committed was this fault
if on the first how heinous e'er it be
to win thy after-love I pardon thee

then give me leave that I may turn the key
that no man enter till my tale be done

have thy desire

my liege beware look to thyself
thou hast a traitor in thy presence there

villain I'll make thee safe

stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear

open the door secure foolhardy king
shall I for love speak treason to thy face
open the door or I will break it open

what is the matter uncle speak
recover breath tell us how near is danger
that we may arm us to encounter it

peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
the treason that my haste forbids me show

I do repent me read not my name there
my heart is not confederate with my hand

'Twas villain ere thy hand did set it down
I tore it from the traitor's bosom king
fear and not love begets his penitence
forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
a serpent that will sting thee to the heart

O heinous strong and bold conspiracy
O loyal father of a treacherous son
thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
from whence this stream through muddy passages
hath held his current and defil'd himself
thy overflow of good converts to bad
and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
this deadly blot in thy digressing son

so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd
as thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
or my sham'd life in his dishonour lies
thou kill'st me in his life giving him breath
the traitor lives the true man's put to death

what ho my liege for God's sake let me in

what shrill-voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry

a woman and thine aunt great king tis I
speak with me pity me open the door
a beggar begs that never begg'd before

our scene is alter'd from a serious thing
and now chang'd to The Beggar and the King
my dangerous cousin let your mother in
I know she's come to pray for your foul sin

if thou do pardon whosoever pray
more sins for this forgiveness prosper may
this fester'd joint cut off the rest rests sound
this let alone will all the rest confound


O king believe not this hard-hearted man
love loving not itself none other can

thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear

sweet York be-patient

hear me gentle liege

rise up good aunt

not yet I thee beseech
and never see day that the happy sees
till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
by pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy

unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee


against them both my true joints bended be

ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace

pleads he in earnest look upon his face
his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
his words come from his mouth ours from our breast
he prays but faintly and would be denied
we pray with heart and soul and all beside
his weary joints would gladly rise I know
our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow
his prayers are full of false hypocrisy
our prayers do out-pray his then let them have
that mercy which true prayer ought to have

good aunt stand up

nay do not say stand up
but pardon' first and afterwards stand up
an if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech
I never long'd to hear a word till now
say pardon king let pity teach thee how
the word is short but not so short as sweet
no word like pardon for kings' mouths so meet

speak it in French king say pardonnez moy

dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
Ah my sour husband my hard-hearted lord
that sett'st the word itself against the word
the chopping French we do not understand
thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
that hearing how our plants and prayers do pierce
pity may move thee pardon to rehearse

good aunt stand up

I do not sue to stand
pardon is all the suit I have in hand

I pardon him as God shall pardon me

O happy vantage of a kneeling knee
yet am I sick for fear speak it again
twice saying pardon' doth not pardon twain
but makes one pardon strong

with all my heart

a god on earth thou art

but for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot
with all the rest of that consorted crew
destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
good uncle help to order several powers
to Oxford or where'er these traitors are
they shall not live within this world I swear
but I will have them if I once know where
uncle farewell and cousin too adieu
your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true

come my old son I pray God make thee new


didst thou not mark the king what words he spake
'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear
was it not so
those were his very words

'Have I no friend quoth he he spake it twice
and urg'd it twice together did he not

he did

and speaking it he wistly looked on me
as who should say I would thou wert the man
that would divorce this terror from my heart
meaning the king at Pomfret Come let's go
I am the king's friend and will rid his foe


I have been studying how I may compare
this prison where I live unto the world
and for because the world is populous
and here is not a creature but myself
I cannot do it yet I'll hammer it out
my soul the father and these two beget
a generation of still-breeding thoughts
and these same thoughts people this little world
in humours like the people of this world
for no thought is contented The better sort
as thoughts of things divine are intermix'd
with scruples and do set the word itself
against the word
as thus Come little ones and then again
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
to thread the postern of a needle's eye
thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
of this hard world my ragged prison walls
and for they cannot die in their own pride
thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
that they are not the first of fortune's slaves
nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
that many have and others must sit there
and in this thought they find a kind of ease
bearing their own misfortune on the back
of such as have before endur'd the like
thus play I in one person many people
and none contented sometimes am I king
then treason makes me wish myself a beggar
and so I am then crushing penury
persuades me I was better when a king
then am I king'd again and by and by
think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke
and straight am nothing but whate'er I be
nor I nor any man that but man is
with nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
with being nothing Music do I hear

ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is
when time is broke and no proportion kept
so is it in the music of men's lives
to check time broke in a disorder'd string
but for the concord of my state and time
had not an ear to hear my true time broke
I wasted time and now doth time waste me
for now hath time made me his numbering clock
my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
whereto my finger like a dial's point
is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
are clamorous groans that strike upon my heart
which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans
show minutes times and hours but my time
runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy
while I stand fooling here his Jack o' the clock
this music mads me let it sound no more
for though it have holp madmen to their wits
in me it seems it will make wise men mad
yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
is a strange brooch in this all-hating world


hail royal prince

thanks noble peer
the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
what art thou and how comest thou hither man
where no man never comes but that sad dog
that brings me food to make misfortune live

I was a poor groom of thy stable king
when thou wert king who travelling towards York
with much ado at length have gotten leave
to look upon my sometimes royal master's face
O how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
in London streets that coronation day
when Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary
that horse that thou so often hast bestrid

rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend
how went he under him

so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground

so proud that Bolingbroke was on his back
that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
this hand hath made him proud with clapping him
would he not stumble Would he not fall down
since pride must have a fall and break the neck
of that proud man that did usurp his back
forgiveness horse why do I rail on thee
since thou created to be aw'd by man
wast born to bear I was not made a horse
and yet I bear a burden like an ass
spur-gall'd and tir'd by jauncing Bolingbroke



if thou love me tis time thou wert away

what my tongue dares not that my heart shall say


my lord will't please you to fall to

taste of it first as thou art wont to do

my lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton who lately came from the king commands the contrary

the devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee
patience is stale and I am weary of it


help help help


villain thine own hand yields thy death's instrument

go thou and fill another room in hell

that hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
that staggers thus my person Exton thy fierce hand
hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land
mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die


as full of valour as of royal blood
both have I spilt O would the deed were good
for now the devil that told me I did well
says that this deed is chronicled in hell
this dead king to the living king I'll bear
take hence the rest and give them burial here


is that the rebels have consum'd with fire
our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire
but whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not

welcome my lord What is the news

first to thy sacred state wish I all happiness
the next news is I have to London sent
the heads of Salisbury Spencer Blunt and Kent
the manner of their taking may appear
at large discoursed in this paper here

we thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains
and to thy worth will add right worthy gains


my lord I have from Oxford sent to London
the heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely
two of the dangerous consorted traitors

thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot
right noble is thy merit well I wot


the grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster
with clog of conscience and sour melancholy
hath yielded up his body to the grave
but here is Carlisle living to abide
thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride

Carlisle this is your doom
choose out some secret place some reverend room
more than thou hast and with it joy thy life
so as thou livest in peace die free from strife
for though mine enemy thou hast ever been
high sparks of honour in thee have I seen


thy buried fear herein all breathless lies
the mightiest of thy greatest enemies
Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought

Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought
a deed of slander with thy fatal hand
upon my head and all this famous land

from your own mouth my lord did I this deed

they love not poison that do poison need
nor do I thee though I did wish him dead
I hate the murderer love him murdered
the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
but neither my good word nor princely favour
with Cain go wander through the shade of night
and never show thy head by day nor light
lords I protest my soul is full of woe
that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
and put on sullen black incontinent
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land
to wash this blood off from my guilty hand
march sadly after grace my mournings here
in weeping after this untimely bier

THE TRAGEDY OF KING RICHARD III

now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of York
and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
our bruised arms hung up for monuments
our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
our dreadful marches to delightful measures
grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
and now instead of mounting barbed steeds
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
but I that am not shap'd for sportive tricks
nor made to court an amorous looking-glass
I that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty
to strut before a wanton ambling nymph
I that am curtail'd of this fair proportion
cheated of feature by dissembling nature
deform'd unfinish'd sent before my time
into this breathing world scarce half made up
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me as I halt by them
why I in this weak piping time of peace
have no delight to pass away the time
unless to see my shadow in the sun
and descant on mine own deformity
and therefore since I cannot prove a lover
to entertain these fair well-spoken days
I am determined to prove a villain
and hate the idle pleasures of these days
by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
to set my brother Clarence and the king
in deadly hate the one against the other
and if King Edward be as true and just
as I am subtle false and treacherous
this day should Clarence closely be mew'd up
about a prophecy which says that G
of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be
dive thoughts down to my soul here Clarence comes


brother good day what means this armed guard

that waits upon your Grace

his majesty
tendering my person's safety hath appointed
this conduct to convey me to the Tower


because my name is George

alack my lord that fault is none of yours
he should for that commit your godfathers
O belike his majesty hath some intent
that you should be new-christen'd in the Tower
but what's the matter Clarence may I know

yea Richard when I know for I protest
as yet I do not but as I can learn
he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
and from the cross-row plucks the letter G
and says a wizard told him that by G
his issue disinherited should be
and for my name of George begins with G
it follows in his thought that I am he
these as I learn and such like toys as these
have mov'd his highness to commit me now
why this it is when men are rul'd by women
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower
my Lady Grey his wife Clarence tis she
that tempers him to this extremity
was it not she and that good man of worship
Antony Woodville her brother there
that made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower
from whence this present day he is deliver'd
we are not safe Clarence we are not safe

by heaven I think there is no man secure
but the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
that trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore
heard you not what a humble suppliant
lord Hastings was to her for his delivery

humbly complaining to her deity
got my lord chamberlain his liberty
I'll tell you what I think it is our way
to be her men and wear her livery
the jealous o'er-worn widow and herself
since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen
are mighty gossips in our monarchy

I beseech your Graces both to pardon me
his majesty hath straitly given in charge
that no man shall have private conference
of what degree soever with your brother

even so an please your worship Brakenbury
you may partake of anything we say
we speak no treason man we say the king
is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
well struck in years fair and not jealous
we say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot
a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
and that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks
how say you sir can you deny all this
with this my lord myself have nought to do

naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee fellow
he that doth naught with her excepting one
were best to do it secretly alone

what one my lord

her husband knave Wouldst thou betray me

I beseech your Grace to pardon me and withal
forbear your conference with the noble duke

we know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey

we are the queen's abjects and must obey
brother farewell I will unto the king
and whatsoe'er you will employ me in
were it to call King Edward's widow sister
meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
touches me deeper than you can imagine

I know it pleaseth neither of us well

well your imprisonment shall not be long
I will deliver you or else lie for you
meantime have patience

I must perforce farewell


go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return
simple plain Clarence I do love thee so
that I will shortly send thy soul to heaven
if heaven will take the present at our hands
but who comes here the new-deliver'd Hastings



as much unto my good lord chamberlain
well are you welcome to this open air
how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment

with patience noble lord as prisoners must
but I shall live my lord to give them thanks
that were the cause of my imprisonment

no doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too
for they that were your enemies are his
and have prevail'd as much on him as you

more pity that the eagles should be mew'd
while kites and buzzards prey at liberty

what news abroad

no news so bad abroad as this at home
and his physicians fear him mightily

now by Saint Paul this news is bad indeed
O he hath kept an evil diet long
and over-much consum'd his royal person
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon
what is he in his bed

he is

go you before and I will follow you

he cannot live I hope and must not die
till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven
I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments
and if I fail not in my deep intent
Clarence hath not another day to live
which done God take King Edward to his mercy
for then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter
what though I kill'd her husband and her father
the readiest way to make the wench amends
is to become her husband and her father
the which will I not all so much for love
as for another secret close intent
by marrying her which I must reach unto
but yet I run before my horse to market
Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns
when they are gone then must I count my gains

set down set down your honourable load
if honour may be shrouded in a hearse
whilst I a while obsequiously lament
the untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster
poor key-cold figure of a holy king
pale ashes of the house of Lancaster
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
wife to thy Edward to thy slaughter'd son
stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds
lo in these windows that let forth thy life
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
O cursed be the hand that made these holes
cursed the heart that had the heart to do it
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
more direful hap betide that hated wretch
that makes us wretched by the death of thee
than I can wish to adders spiders toads
or any creeping venom'd thing that lives
if ever he have child abortive be it
prodigious and untimely brought to light
whose ugly and unnatural aspect
may fright the hopeful mother at the view
and that be heir to his unhappiness
if ever he have wife let her be made
more miserable by the death of him
than I am made by my young lord and thee
taken from Paul's to be interred there
and still as you are weary of the weight
rest you whiles I lament King Henry's corse

stay you that bear the corse and set it down

what black magician conjures up this fiend
to stop devoted charitable deeds

villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys

my lord stand back and let the coffin pass

unmanner'd dog stand thou when I command
advance thy halberd higher than my breast
or by Saint Paul I'll strike thee to my foot
and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness

what do you tremble are you all afraid
alas I blame you not for you are mortal
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
thou hadst but power over his mortal body
his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone

sweet saint for charity be not so curst

foul devil for God's sake hence and trouble us not
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
behold this pattern of thy butcheries
O gentlemen see see dead Henry's wounds
open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh
blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
for tis thy presence that exhales this blood
from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
provokes this deluge most unnatural
O God which this blood mad'st revenge his death
O earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death
either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead
or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered

lady you know no rules of charity
which renders good for bad blessings for curses

villain thou know'st no law of God nor man
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity

but I know none and therefore am no beast

O wonderful when devils tell the truth

more wonderful when angels are so angry
of these supposed evils to give me leave
by circumstance but to acquit myself

vouchsafe diffus'd infection of a man
for these known evils but to give me leave
by circumstance to curse thy cursed self

fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
some patient leisure to excuse myself

fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
no excuse current but to hang thyself

by such despair I should accuse myself

and by despairing shouldst thou stand excus'd
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself
which didst unworthy slaughter upon others


then say they were not slain
but dead they are and devilish slave by thee

I did not kill your husband

why then he is alive

nay he is dead and slain by Edward's hand

in thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw
thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
the which thou once didst bend against her breast
but that thy brothers beat aside the point

I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders

thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
didst thou not kill this king

I grant ye

dost grant me hedge-hog Then God grant me too
thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
O he was gentle mild and virtuous

the fitter for the King of heaven that hath him

he is in heaven where thou shalt never come

let him thank me that help'd to send him thither
for he was fitter for that place than earth

and thou unfit for any place but hell

yes one place else if you will bear me name it


your bed-chamber

ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest

so will it madam till I lie with you

I hope so

I know so But gentle Lady Anne
to leave this keen encounter of our wits
and fall somewhat into a slower method
is not the causer of the timeless deaths
of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward
as blameful as the executioner

thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect

your beauty was the cause of that effect
to undertake the death of all the world
so might I live one hour in your sweet bosom

if I thought that I tell thee homicide
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks

these eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack
you should not blemish it if I stood by
as all the world is cheered by the sun
so I by that it is my day my life

black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life

curse not thyself fair creature thou art both

I would I were to be reveng'd on thee

it is a quarrel most unnatural
to be reveng'd on him that loveth thee
it is a quarrel just and reasonable
to be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband

he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
did it to help thee to a better husband

his better doth not breathe upon the earth

he lives that loves thee better than he could

name him

Plantagenet

why that was he

the self-same name but one of better nature

where is he
here

why dost thou spit at me

would it were mortal poison for thy sake

never came poison from so sweet a place

never hung poison on a fouler toad
out of my sight thou dost infect mine eyes

thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine

would they were basilisks to strike thee dead

I would they were that I might die at once
for now they kill me with a living death
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops
no when my father York and Edward wept
to hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
when black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him
nor when thy war-like father like a child
told the sad story of my father's death
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
that all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
like trees bedash'd with rain in that sad time
my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
I never su'd to friend nor enemy
my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing words
but now thy beauty is propos'd my fee
my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak

teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made
for kissing lady not for such contempt
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
which if thou please to hide in this true breast
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
I lay it open to the deadly stroke
and humbly beg the death upon my knee

nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry
but twas thy beauty that provoked me
nay now dispatch twas I that stabb'd young Edward

but twas thy heavenly face that set me on

take up the sword again or take up me

arise dissembler though I wish thy death
I will not be thy executioner

then bid me kill myself and I will do it

I have already
that was in thy rage
speak it again and even with the word
this hand which for thy love did kill thy love
shall for thy love kill a far truer love
to both their deaths shalt thou be accessary

I would I knew thy heart

'Tis figur'd in my tongue

I fear me both are false

then never man was true

well well put up your sword

say then my peace is made

that shalt thou know hereafter
but shall I live in hope

all men I hope live so

vouchsafe to wear this ring

to take is not to give


look how my ring encompasseth thy finger
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
wear both of them for both of them are thine
and if thy poor devoted servant may
but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
thou dost confirm his happiness for ever

what is it

that it may please you leave these sad designs
and presently repair to Crosby-place
where after I have solemnly interr'd
at Chertsey monastery this noble king
and wet his grave with my repentant tears
I will with all expedient duty see you
for divers unknown reasons I beseech you
grant me this boon

with all my heart and much it joys me too
to see you are become so penitent
tressel and Berkeley go along with me

bid me farewell

'Tis more than you deserve
but since you teach me how to flatter you
imagine I have said farewell already



toward Chertsey noble lord

no to White-Friars there attend my coming

was ever woman in this humour woo'd
was ever woman in this humour won
I'll have her but I will not keep her long
what I that kill'd her husband and his father
to take her in her heart's extremest hate
with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
the bleeding witness of her hatred by
having God her conscience and these bars against me
and nothing I to back my suit withal
but the plain devil and dissembling looks
and yet to win her all the world to nothing
ha
hath she forgot already that brave prince
Edward her lord whom I some three months since
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
fram'd in the prodigality of nature
young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
the spacious world cannot again afford
and will she yet abase her eyes on me
that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
and made her widow to a woeful bed
on me whose all not equals Edward's moiety
on me that halt and am misshapen thus
my dukedom to a beggarly denier
I do mistake my person all this while
upon my life she finds although I cannot
myself to be a marvellous proper man
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass
and entertain a score or two of tailors
to study fashions to adorn my body
since I am crept in favour with myself
I will maintain it with some little cost
but first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave
shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass
that I may see my shadow as I pass


have patience madam there's no doubt his majesty
will soon recover his accustom'd health

in that you brook it ill it makes him worse
therefore for God's sake entertain good comfort
and cheer his Grace with quick and merry words

if he were dead what would betide on me

no other harm but loss of such a lord

the loss of such a lord includes all harms

the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
to be your comforter when he is gone
Ah he is young and his minority
is put into the trust of Richard Gloucester
a man that loves not me nor none of you

is it concluded he shall be protector

it is determin'd not concluded yet
but so it must be if the king miscarry


here come the Lords of Buckingham and Stanley

good time of day unto your royal Grace

God make your majesty joyful as you have been

the Countess Richmond good my Lord of Stanley
to your good prayer will scarcely say amen
yet Stanley notwithstanding she's your wife
I hate not you for her proud arrogance

I do beseech you either not believe
the envious slanders of her false accusers
or if she be accus'd on true report
bear with her weakness which I think proceeds
from wayward sickness and no grounded malice

saw you the king to-day my Lord of Stanley

but now the Duke of Buckingham and I
are come from visiting his majesty

what likelihood of his amendment lords

madam good hope his Grace speaks cheerfully

God grant him health did you confer with him

between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers
and between them and my lord chamberlain
and sent to warn them to his royal presence

would all were well But that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest


they do me wrong and I will not endure it
who are they that complain unto the king
that I forsooth am stern and love them not
by holy Paul they love his Grace but lightly
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
because I cannot flatter and speak fair
smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog
duck with French nods and apish courtesy
I must be held a rancorous enemy
cannot a plain man live and think no harm
but thus his simple truth must be abus'd

to whom in all this presence speaks your Grace

to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
when have I injur'd thee when done thee wrong
or thee or thee or any of your faction
a plague upon you all His royal person
whom God preserve better than you would wish
cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints

brother of Gloucester you mistake the matter
the king on his own royal disposition
and not provok'd by any suitor else
aiming belike at your interior hatred
that in your outward action shows itself
against my children brothers and myself
makes him to send that thereby he may gather
the ground of your ill-will and so remove it
I cannot tell the world is grown so bad
that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
since every Jack became a gentleman
there's many a gentle person made a Jack

come come we know your meaning brother Gloucester
you envy my advancement and my friends'
God grant we never may have need of you

meantime God grants that we have need of you
our brother is imprison'd by your means
myself disgrac'd and the nobility
held in contempt while great promotions
are daily given to ennoble those
that scarce some two days since were worth a noble

by him that rais'd me to this careful height
from that contented hap which I enjoy'd
I never did incense his majesty
an earnest advocate to plead for him
my lord you do me shameful injury
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects

you may deny that you were not the mean
of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment

she may my lord for

she may Lord Rivers why who knows not so
she may do more sir than denying that
she may help you to many fair preferments
and then deny her aiding hand therein
and lay those honours on your high deserts
what may she not She may ay marry may she

what marry may she

what marry may she marry with a king
I wis your grandam had a worser match

my Lord of Gloucester I have too long borne
your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
by heaven I will acquaint his majesty
of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd
I had rather be a country servantmaid
than a great queen with this condition
to be so baited scorn'd and stormed at
small joy have I in being England's queen


and lessen'd be that small God I beseech him
thy honour state and seat is due to me

what threat you me with telling of the king
tell him and spare not look what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower

out devil I remember them too well
thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower
and Edward my poor son at Tewksbury

ere you were queen ay or your husband king
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs
a weeder-out of his proud adversaries
a liberal rewarder of his friends
to royalize his blood I split mine own

ay and much better blood than his or thine

in all which time you and your husband Grey
were factious for the house of Lancaster
and Rivers so were you Was not your husband
in Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain
let me put in your minds if you forget
what you have been ere now and what you are

a murderous villain and so still thou art

poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick
ay and forswore himself which Jesu pardon

which God revenge

to fight on Edward's party for the crown
and for his meed poor lord he is mew'd up
I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's
or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this world

hie thee to hell for shame and leave this world
thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is

my Lord of Gloucester in those busy days
which here you urge to prove us enemies
so should we you if you should be our king

if I should be I had rather be a pedlar
far be it from my heart the thought thereof

as little joy my lord as you suppose
you should enjoy were you this country's king
as little joy you may suppose in me
that I enjoy being the queen thereof

as little joy enjoys the queen thereof
for I am she and altogether joyless
I can no longer hold me patient

hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
in sharing that which you have pill'd from me
which of you trembles not that looks on me
if not that I being queen you bow like subjects
yet that by you depos'd you quake like rebels

foul wrinkled witch what mak'st thou in my sight

but repetition of what thou hast marr'd
that will I make before I let thee go

wert thou not banished on pain of death

I was but I do find more pain in banishment
than death can yield me here by my abode
a husband and a son thou ow'st to me
and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
this sorrow that I have by right is yours
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine

the curse my noble father laid on thee
when thou didst crown his war-like brows with paper
and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes
and then to dry them gav'st the duke a clout
his curses then from bitterness of soul
denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee
and God not we hath plagu'd thy bloody deed

so just is God to right the innocent

O twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
and the most merciless that e'er was heard of

tyrants themselves wept when it was reported

no man but prophesied revenge for it

Northumberland then present wept to see it

what were you snarling all before I came
ready to catch each other by the throat
and turn you all your hatred now on me
did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
their kingdom's loss my woeful banishment
should all but answer for that peevish brat
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
though not by war by surfeit die your king
as ours by murder to make him a king
Edward thy son that now is Prince of Wales
for Edward my son which was Prince of Wales
die in his youth by like untimely violence
thyself a queen for me that was a queen
outlive thy glory like my wretched self
long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss
and see another as I see thee now
deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine
long die thy happy days before thy death
and after many lengthen'd hours of grief
die neither mother wife nor England's queen
Rivers and Dorset you were standers by
and so wast thou Lord Hastings when my son
that none of you may live your natural age
but by some unlook'd accident cut off

have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag

and leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
if heaven have any grievous plague in store
exceeding those that I can wish upon thee
O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
and then hurl down their indignation
on thee the troubler of the poor world's peace
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
unless it be while some tormenting dream
affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
thou elvish-mark'd abortive rooting hog
thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb
thou loathed issue of thy father's loins
thou rag of honour thou detested

Margaret

Richard

ha

I call thee not

I cry thee mercy then for I did think
that thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names

why so I did but look'd for no reply
O let me make the period to my curse

'Tis done by me and ends in Margaret
thus have you breath'd your curso against yourself

poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
fool fool thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself
the day will come that thou shalt wish for me
to help thee curse this pois'nous bunch-back'd toad

false-boding woman end thy frantic curse
lest to thy harm thou move our patience

foul shame upon you you have all mov'd mine

were you well serv'd you would be taught your duty

to serve me well you all should do me duty
teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dispute not with her she is lunatic

peace Master marquess you are malapert
your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current
O that your young nobility could judge
what twere to lose it and be miserable
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces

good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess

it touches you my lord as much as me

ay and much more but I was born so high
our aery buildeth in the cedar's top
and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun

and turns the sun to shade alas alas
witness my son now in the shade of death
hath in eternal darkness folded up
your aery buildeth in our aery's nest
O God that seest it do not suffer it
as it was won with blood lost be it so

peace peace for shame if not for charity

urge neither charity nor shame to me
uncharitably with me have you dealt
and shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd
my charity is outrage life my shame
and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage

have done have done

O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand
in sign of league and amity with thee
now fair befall thee and thy noble house
thy garments are not spotted with our blood

nor no one here for curses never pass
the lips of those that breathe them in the air

I will not think but they ascend the sky
and there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace
O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog
look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
his venom tooth will rankle to the death
have not to do with him beware of him
sin death and hell have set their marks on him
and all their ministers attend on him

what doth she say my Lord of Buckingham

nothing that I respect my gracious lord

what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
and soothe the devil that I warn thee from
when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
and say poor Margaret was a prophetess
live each of you the subject to his hate
and he to yours and all of you to God's


my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses

and so doth mine I muse why she's at liberty

I cannot blame her by God's holy mother
she hath had too much wrong and I repent
my part thereof that I have done to her

I never did her any to my knowledge

yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
I was too hot to do somebody good
that is too cold in thinking of it now
he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause thereof

a virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion
to pray for them that have done scath to us

so do I ever

being well-advis'd
for had I curs'd now I had curs'd myself


madam his majesty doth call for you
and for your Grace and you my noble lords

Catesby I come Lords will you go with me

we wait upon your Grace

I do the wrong and first begin to brawl
the secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others
Clarence whom I indeed have cast in darkness
I do beweep to many simple gulls
namely to Stanley Hastings Buckingham
and tell them tis the queen and her allies
that stir the king against the duke my brother
now they believe it and withal whet me
to be reveng'd on Rivers Vaughan Grey
but then I sigh and with a piece of scripture
tell them that God bids us do good for evil
and thus I clothe my naked villany
with odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ
and seem a saint when most I play the devil


but soft here come my executioners
how now my hardy stout resolved mates
are you now going to dispatch this thing

we are my lord and come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is

well thought upon I have it here about me

when you have done repair to Crosby-place
but sirs be sudden in the execution
withal obdurate do not hear him plead
for Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him

tut tut my lord we will not stand to prate
talkers are no good doers be assur'd
we go to use our hands and not our tongues

your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears
I like you lads about your business straight

we will my noble lord


why looks your Grace so heavily to-day

O I have pass'd a miserable night
so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams
that as I am a Christian faithful man
I would not spend another such a night
though twere to buy a world of happy days
so full of dismal terror was the time

what was your dream my lord I pray you tell me

methought that I had broken from the Tower
and was embark'd to cross to Burgundy
and in my company my brother Gloucester
who from my cabin tempted me to walk
and cited up a thousand heavy times
during the wars of York and Lancaster
that had befall'n us As we pac'd along
upon the giddy footing of the hatches
methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling
struck me that thought to stay him overboard
into the tumbling billows of the main
lord Lord methought what pain it was to drown
what dreadful noise of water in mine ears
what sights of ugly death within mine eyes
methought I saw a thousand fearful wracks
a thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon
wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
inestimable stones unvalu'd jewels
all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea
some lay in dead men's skulls and in those holes
where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
that woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep

had you such leisure in the time of death
to gaze upon those secrets of the deep

methought I had and often did I strive
to yield the ghost but still the envious flood
stopt in my soul and would not let it forth
to find the empty vast and wandering air
but smother'd it within my panting bulk
which almost burst to belch it in the sea

awak'd you not with this sore agony

no no my dream was lengthen'd after life
O then began the tempest to my soul
I pass'd methought the melancholy flood
with that grim ferryman which poets write of
unto the kingdom of perpetual night
the first that there did greet my stranger soul
who cried aloud What scourge for perjury
can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence
and so he vanish'd then came wandering by
a shadow like an angel with bright hair
dabbled in blood and he shriek'd out aloud
'Clarence is come false fleeting perjur'd Clarence
that stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury
seize on him Furies take him unto torment
with that methought a legion of foul fiends
environ'd me and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries that with the very noise
I trembling wak'd and for a season after
could not believe but that I was in hell
such terrible impression made my dream

no marvel lord though it affrighted you
I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it

O Brakenbury I have done these things
for Edward's sake and see how he requites me
O God if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
but thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds
yet execute thy wrath on me alone
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
I pray thee gentle keeper stay by me
my soul is heavy and I fain would sleep

I will my lord God give your Grace good rest

sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
makes the night morning and the noon-tide night
princes have but their titles for their glories
an outward honour for an inward toil
and for unfelt imaginations
they often feel a world of restless cares
so that between their titles and low names
there's nothing differs but the outward fame

ho who's here

what wouldst thou fellow and how cam'st thou hither

I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs

what so brief

'Tis better sir than to be tedious
let him see our commission and talk no more


I am in this commanded to deliver
the noble Duke of Clarence to your hands
I will not reason what is meant hereby
because I will be guiltless of the meaning
there lies the duke asleep and there the keys
I'll to the king and signify to him
that thus I have resign'd to you my charge
you may sir tis a point of wisdom fare you well


what shall we stab him as he sleeps

no he'll say twas done cowardly when he wakes

when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till the judgment-day

why then he'll say we stabbed him sleeping

the urging of that word judgment' hath bred a kind of remorse in me

what art thou afraid

not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damn'd for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me

I thought thou hadst been resolute


I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so

nay I prithee stay a little I hope my holy humour will change it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty

how dost thou feel thyself now

some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me

remember our reward when the deed's done

'Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward

where's thy conscience now

in the Duke of Gloucester's purse

so when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out


what if it come to thee again

I'll not meddle with it it makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom it fills one full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that I found it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it

'Zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke

take the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh

tut I am strong-framed he cannot prevail with me

spoke like a tall fellow that respects his reputation Come shall we to this gear

take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then throw him into the malmsey-butt in the next room

O excellent device make a sop of him

soft he wakes


no we'll reason with him

where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine

you shall have wine enough my lord anon

in God's name what art thou

a man as you are

but not as I am royal

nor you as we are loyal

thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble

my voice is now the king's my looks mine own

your eyes do menace me why look you pale
who sent you hither Wherefore do you come

to to to

to murder me

ay ay

you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
wherein my friends have I offended you

offended us you have not but the king

I shall be reconcil'd to him again

never my lord therefore prepare to die

to slay the innocent What is my offence
where is the evidence that doth accuse me
what lawful quest have given their verdict up
unto the frowning judge or who pronounc'd
the bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death
before I be convict by course of law
to threaten me with death is most unlawful
I charge you as you hope to have redemption
by Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins
that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable

what we will do we do upon command

and he that hath commanded is our king

erroneous vassal the great King of kings
hath in the table of his law commanded
that thou shalt do no murder will you then
take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand
to hurl upon their heads that break his law

and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
for false forswearing and for murder too
thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
in quarrel of the house of Lancaster

and like a traitor to the name of God
didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
unripp'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son

whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend

how canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us
when thou hast broke it in such dear degree

alas for whose sake did I that ill deed
for Edward for my brother for his sake
for in that sin he is as deep as I
if God will be avenged for the deed
O know you yet he doth it publicly
take not the quarrel from his powerful arm
he needs no indirect or lawless course
to cut off those that have offended him

who made thee then a bloody minister
when gallant-springing brave Plantagenet
that princely novice was struck dead by thee

my brother's love the devil and my rage

thy brother's love our duty and thy fault
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee

if you do love my brother hate not me
I am his brother and I love him well
if you are hir'd for meed go back again
who shall reward you better for my life
than Edward will for tidings of my death

you are deceiv'd your brother Gloucester hates you

O no he loves me and he holds me dear
go you to him from me

ay so we will

tell him when that our princely father York
bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
and charg'd us from his soul to love each other
he little thought of this divided friendship
bid Gloucester think on this and he will weep

ay millstones as he lesson'd us to weep

O do not slander him for he is kind
right
as snow in harvest Thou deceiv'st thyself
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here

it cannot be for he bewept my fortune
and hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs
that he would labour my delivery

why so he doth when he delivers you
from this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven

make peace with God for you must die my lord

hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
to counsel me to make my peace with God
and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind
that thou wilt war with God by murdering me
O sirs consider he that set you on
to do this deed will hate you for the deed
what shall we do

relent and save your souls

relent tis cowardly and womanish

not to relent is beastly savage devilish
which of you if you were a prince's son
being pent from liberty as I am now
if two such murd'rers as yourselves came to you
would not entreat for life
my friend I spy some pity in thy looks
O if thine eye be not a flatterer
come thou on my side and entreat for me
as you would beg were you in my distress
a begging prince what beggar pities not

look behind you my lord

I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within


a bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd
how fain like Pilate would I wash my hands
of this most grievous murder


how now what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not
by heaven the duke shall know how slack you have been

I would he knew that I had sav'd his brother
take thou the fee and tell him what I say
for I repent me that the duke is slain


so do not I go coward as thou art
well I'll go hide the body in some hole
till that the duke give order for his burial
for this will out and here I must not stay

why so now have I done a good day's work
you peers continue this united league
I every day expect an embassage
from my Redeemer to redeem me hence
and more in peace my soul shall part to heaven
since I have made my friends at peace on earth
Rivers and Hastings take each other's hand
dissemble not your hatred swear your love

by heaven my soul is purg'd from grudging hate
and with my hand I seal my true heart's love

so thrive I as I truly swear the like

take heed you dally not before your king
lest he that is the supreme King of kings
confound your hidden falsehood and award

so prosper I as I swear perfect love

and I as I love Hastings with my heart

madam yourself are not exempt in this
nor you son Dorset Buckingham nor you
you have been factious one against the other
wife love Lord Hastings let him kiss your hand
and what you do do it unfeignedly

there Hastings I will never more remember
our former hatred so thrive I and mine

Dorset embrace him Hastings love lord marquess

this interchange of love I here protest
upon my part shall be inviolable



now princely Buckingham seal thou this league
with thy embracements to my wife's allies
and make me happy in your unity

whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
upon your Grace but with all duteous love
doth cherish you and yours God punish me
with hate in those where I expect most love
when I have most need to employ a friend
and most assured that he is a friend
deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
be he unto me This do I beg of God
when I am cold in love to you or yours


a pleasing cordial princely Buckingham
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
to make the blessed period of this peace

and in good time here comes the noble duke


good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
and princely peers a happy time of day

happy indeed as we have spent the day
Gloucester we have done deeds of charity
made peace of enmity fair love of hate
between these swelling wrong-incensed peers

a blessed labour my most sovereign lord
among this princely heap if any here
by false intelligence or wrong surmise
hold me a foe
if I unwittingly or in my rage
have aught committed that is hardly borne
to reconcile me to his friendly peace
'Tis death to me to be at enmity
I hate it and desire all good men's love
first madam I entreat true peace of you
which I will purchase with my duteous service
of you my noble cousin Buckingham
if ever any grudge were lodg'd between us
of you Lord Rivers and Lord Grey of you
that all without desert have frown'd on me
of you Lord Woodvile and Lord Scales of you
dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
I do not know that Englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds
more than the infant that is born to-night
I thank my God for my humility

a holy day shall this be kept hereafter
I would to God all strifes were well compounded
my sov'reign lord I do beseech your highness

why madam have I offer'd love for this
to be so flouted in this royal presence
who knows not that the gentle duke is dead

you do him injury to scorn his corse

who knows not he is dead who knows he is

all-seeing heaven what a world is this

look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest

ay my good lord and no man in the presence
but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks

is Clarence dead the order was revers'd

but he poor man by your first order died
some tardy cripple bore the countermand
that came too lag to see him buried
God grant that some less noble and less loyal
nearer in bloody thoughts and not in blood
deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did
and yet go current from suspicion


a boon my sov'reign for my service done

I prithee peace my soul is full of sorrow

I will not rise unless your highness hear me

then say at once what is it thou request'st

the forfeit sovereign of my servant's life
who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk
have I a tongue to doom my brother's death
and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
my brother kill'd no man his fault was thought
and yet his punishment was bitter death
who su'd to me for him who in my wrath
kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advis'd
who spoke of brotherhood who spoke of love
who told me how the poor soul did forsake
the mighty Warwick and did fight for me
who told me in the field at Tewksbury
when Oxford had me down he rescu'd me
and said Dear brother live and be a king
who told me when we both lay in the field
frozen almost to death how he did lap me
even in his garments and did give himself
all thin and naked to the numb cold night
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you
had so much grace to put it in my mind
have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd
the precious image of our dear Redeemer
you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
and I unjustly too must grant it you
but for my brother not a man would speak
nor I ungracious speak unto myself
for him poor soul The proudest of you all
have been beholding to him in his life
yet none of you would once beg for his life
O God I fear thy justice will take hold
on me and you and mine and yours for this
come Hastings help me to my closet O poor Clarence


this is the fruit of rashness Mark'd you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen
look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death
O they did urge it still unto the king
God will revenge it Come lords will you go

we wait upon your Grace


good grandam tell us is our father dead

no boy

why do you wring your hands and beat your breast
and cry O Clarence my unhappy son

why do you look on us and shake your head
and call us orphans wretches castaways
if that our noble father be alive

my pretty cousins you mistake me much
I do lament the sickness of the king
as loath to lose him not your father's death
it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost
then grandam you conclude that he is dead
the king mine uncle is to blame for it
God will revenge it whom I will importune
with earnest prayers all to that effect

and so will I

peace children peace the king doth love you well
incapable and shallow innocents
you cannot guess who caus'd your father's death

grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester
told me the king provok'd to't by the queen
devis'd impeachments to imprison him
and when my uncle told me so he wept
and pitied me and kindly kiss'd my cheek
bade me rely on him as on my father
and he would love me dearly as his child

and with a virtuous vizard hide deep vice
he is my son ay and therein my shame
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit

think you my uncle did dissemble grandam

ay boy

I cannot think it Hark what noise is this


oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
to chide my fortune and torment myself
I'll join with black despair against my soul
and to myself become an enemy

what means this scene of rude impatience

to make an act of tragic violence
why grow the branches now the root is wither'd
why wither not the leaves that want their sap
if you will live lament if die be brief
that our swift-winged souls may catch the king's
or like obedient subjects follow him
to his new kingdom of perpetual rest

Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow
as I had title in thy noble husband
I have bewept a worthy husband's death
and liv'd with looking on his images
but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
are crack'd in pieces by malignant death
and I for comfort have but one false glass
that grieves me when I see my shame in him
thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
and hast the comfort of thy children left thee
but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs
thine being but a moiety of my grief
to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries

Ah aunt you wept not for our father's death
how can we aid you with our kindred tears

our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd
your widow-dolour likewise be unwept

give me no help in lamentation
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
that I being govern'd by the wat'ry moon
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
Ah for my husband for my dear Lord Edward

Ah for our father for our dear Lord Clarence

alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence
what stay had I but Edward and he's gone

what stay had we but Clarence and he's gone

what stays had I but they and they are gone

was never widow had so dear a loss

were never orphans had so dear a loss

was never mother had so dear a loss
alas I am the mother of these griefs
their woes are parcell'd mine are general
she for an Edward weeps and so do I
I for a Clarence weep so doth not she
these babes for Clarence weep and so do I
I for an Edward weep so do not they
alas you three on me threefold distress'd
pour all your tears I am your sorrow's nurse

comfort dear mother God is much displeas'd
that you take with unthankfulness his doing
in common worldly things tis call'd ungrateful
with dull unwillingness to repay a debt
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
much more to be thus opposite with heaven
for it requires the royal debt it lent you

madam bethink you like a careful mother
of the young prince your son send straight for him
let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives
drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave
and plant your joys in living Edward's throne


sister have comfort all of us have cause
to wail the dimming of our shining star
but none can cure their harms by wailing them
I did not see your Grace humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing

God bless thee and put meekness in thy mind
love charity obedience and true duty

amen

and make me die a good old man
that is the butt-end of a mother's blessing
I marvel that her Grace did leave it out

you cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers
that bear this heavy mutual load of moan
now cheer each other in each other's love
though we have spent our harvest of this king
we are to reap the harvest of his son
the broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts
but lately splinter'd knit and join'd together
me seemeth good that with some little train
forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
hither to London to be crown'd our king

why with some little train my Lord of Buckingham

marry my lord lest by a multitude
the new-heal'd wound of malice should break out
which would be so much the more dangerous
by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd
where every horse bears his commanding rein
and may direct his course as please himself
as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
in my opinion ought to be prevented

I hope the king made peace with all of us
and the compact is firm and true in me

and so in me and so I think in all
to no apparent likelihood of breach
which haply by much company might be urg'd
therefore I say with noble Buckingham
that it is meet so few should fetch the prince

and so say I

then be it so and go we to determine
who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow
madam and you my mother will you go
to give your censures in this business


my lord whoever journeys to the prince
for God's sake let not us two stay at home
for by the way I'll sort occasion
as index to the story we late talk'd of
to part the queen's proud kindred from the prince

my oracle my prophet My dear cousin
I as a child will go by thy direction
towards Ludlow then for we'll not stay behind


good morrow neighbour whither away so fast

I promise you I scarcely know myself
hear you the news abroad

ay that the king is dead

ill news by'r lady seldom comes the better
I fear I fear twill prove a giddy world


neighbours God speed

give you good morrow sir
doth the news hold of good King Edward's death

ay sir it is too true God help the while

then masters look to see a troublous world

no no by God's good grace his son shall reign

woe to that land that's govern'd by a child

in him there is a hope of government
that in his nonage council under him
and in his full and ripen'd years himself
no doubt shall then and till then govern well

so stood the state when Henry the Sixth
was crown'd at Paris but at nine months old

stood the state so no no good friends God wot
with politic grave counsel then the king
had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace

why so hath this both by his father and mother

better it were they all came by his father
or by his father there were none at all
for emulation who shall now be nearest
will touch us all too near if God prevent not
O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester
and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud
and were they to be rul'd and not to rule
this sickly land might solace as before

come come we fear the worst all will be well

when clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks
when great leaves fall then winter is at hand
when the sun sets who doth not look for night
all may be well but if God sort it so
'Tis more than we deserve or I expect

truly the hearts of men are full of fear
you cannot reason almost with a man
that looks not heavily and full of dread

before the days of change still is it so
by a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
ensuing danger as by proof we see
the waters swell before a boisterous storm
but leave it all to God Whither away

marry we were sent for to the justices

and so was I I'll bear you company


last night I hear they lay at Northampton
to-morrow or next day they will be here

I long with all my heart to see the prince
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him

but I hear no they say my son of York
hath almost overta'en him in his growth

ay mother but I would not have it so

why my young cousin it is good to grow

grandam one night as we did sit at supper
my uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
more than my brother Ay quoth my uncle Gloucester
'Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace
and since methinks I would not grow so fast
because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste

in him that did object the same to thee
he was the wretched'st thing when he was young
so long a-growing and so leisurely
that if his rule were true he should be gracious

and so no doubt he is my gracious madam

I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt

now by my troth if I had been remember'd
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout
to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine

how my young York I prithee let me hear it

marry they say my uncle grew so fast
that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth
grandam this would have been a biting jest
I prithee pretty York who told thee this

grandam his nurse

his nurse why she was dead ere thou wast born

if twere not she I cannot tell who told me

a parlous boy go to you are too shrewd

good madam be not angry with the child

pitchers have ears


here comes a messenger What news

such news my lord as grieves me to report


well madam and in health

what is thy news

lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret
with them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisoners

who hath committed them

the mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham

for what offence

the sum of all I can I have disclos'd
why or for what the nobles were committed
is all unknown to me my gracious lord

the tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind
insulting tyranny begins to jet
upon the innocent and aweless throne
welcome destruction death and massacre
I see as in a map the end of all

accursed and unquiet wrangling days
how many of you have mine eyes beheld
my husband lost his life to get the crown
and often up and down my sons were toss'd
for me to joy and weep their gain and loss
and being seated and domestic broils
clean over-blown themselves the conquerors
make war upon themselves brother to brother
blood to blood self against self O preposterous
and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
or let me die to look on death no more

come come my boy we will to sanctuary

stay I will go with you

you have no cause

my gracious lady go
and thither bear your treasure and your goods
for my part I'll resign unto your Grace
the seal I keep and so betide to me
as well I tender you and all of yours
come I'll conduct you to the sanctuary


welcome sweet prince to London to your chamber

welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign
the weary way hath made you melancholy

no uncle but our crosses on the way
I want more uncles here to welcome me

sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years
hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit
no more can you distinguish of a man
than of his outward show which God he knows
seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
those uncles which you want were dangerous
your Grace attended to their sugar'd words
but look'd not on the poison of their hearts
God keep you from them and from such false friends

God keep me from false friends but they were none

my lord the Mayor of London comes to greet you


God bless your Grace with health and happy days

I thought my mother and my brother York
would long ere this have met us on the way
fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not
to tell us whether they will come or no


and in good time here comes the sweating lord

welcome my lord What will our mother come

on what occasion God he knows not I
the queen your mother and your brother York
have taken sanctuary the tender prince
would fain have come with me to meet your Grace
but by his mother was perforce withheld

fie what an indirect and peevish course
is this of hers Lord Cardinal will your Grace
persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
if she deny Lord Hastings go with him
and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce

my Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory
can from his mother win the Duke of York
anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
to mild entreaties God in heaven forbid
we should infringe the holy privilege
of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
would I be guilty of so great a sin

you are too senseless-obstinate my lord
too ceremonious and traditional
weigh it but with the grossness of this age
you break not sanctuary in seizing him
the benefit thereof is always granted
to those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
and those who have the wit to claim the place
this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it
then taking him from thence that is not there
you break no privilege nor charter there
oft have I heard of sanctuary men
but sanctuary children ne'er till now

my lord you shall o'er-rule my mind for once
come on Lord Hastings will you go with me

I go my lord

good lords make all the speedy haste you may

say uncle Gloucester if our brother come
where shall we sojourn till our coronation

where it seems best unto your royal self
if I may counsel you some day or two
your highness shall repose you at the Tower
then where you please and shall be thought most fit

I do not like the Tower of any place
did Julius C sar build that place my lord

he did my gracious lord begin that place
which since succeeding ages have re-edified

is it upon record or else reported
successively from age to age he built it

upon record my gracious lord

but say my lord it were not register'd
methinks the truth should live from age to age
as twere retail'd to all posterity
even to the general all-ending day

so wise so young they say do never live long


I say without characters fame lives long


thus like the formal Vice Iniquity
I moralize two meanings in one word

that Julius C sar was a famous man
with what his valour did enrich his wit
his wit set down to make his valour live
death makes no conquest of this conqueror
for now he lives in fame though not in life
I'll tell you what my cousin Buckingham

what my gracious lord

an if I live until I be a man
I'll win our ancient right in France again
or die a soldier as I liv'd a king
short summers lightly have a forward spring


now in good time here comes the Duke of York

Richard of York how fares our loving brother

well my dread lord so must I call you now

ay brother to our grief as it is yours
too late he died that might have kept that title
which by his death hath lost much majesty

how fares our cousin noble Lord of York

I thank you gentle uncle O my lord
you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far


and therefore is he idle

O my fair cousin I must not say so

then he is more beholding to you than I

he may command me as my sovereign
but you have power in me as in a kinsman

I pray you uncle give me this dagger

my dagger little cousin with all my heart

a beggar brother

of my kind uncle that I know will give
and being but a toy which is no grief to give


a greater gift O that's the sword to it

ay gentle cousin were it light enough

O then I see you'll part but with light gifts
in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay

it is too weighty for your Grace to wear

I weigh it lightly were it heavier

what would you have my weapon little lord

I would that I might thank you as you call me

how

little
my Lord of York will still be cross in talk
uncle your Grace knows how to bear with him

you mean to bear me not to bear with me
uncle my brother mocks both you and me
because that I am little like an ape
he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders

with what a sharp provided with he reasons
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
he prettily and aptly taunts himself
so cunning and so young is wonderful

my lord will't please you pass along
myself and my good cousin Buckingham
will to your mother to entreat of her
to meet you at the Tower and welcome you

what will you go unto the Tower my lord
my Lord Protector needs will have it so

I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower

why what would you fear

marry my uncle Clarence' angry ghost
my grandam told me he was murder'd there

I fear no uncles dead

nor none that live I hope

an if they live I hope I need not fear
but come my lord and with a heavy heart
thinking on them go I unto the Tower


think you my lord this little prating York
to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously

no doubt no doubt O tis a parlous boy
bold quick ingenious forward capable
he's all the mother's from the top to toe

well let them rest Come hither Catesby thou art sworn
as deeply to effect what we intend
as closely to conceal what we impart
thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way
what think'st thou is it not an easy matter
to make William Lord Hastings of our mind
for the instalment of this noble duke
in the seat royal of this famous isle

he for his father's sake so loves the prince
that he will not be won to aught against him

what think'st thou then of Stanley what will he
he will do all in all as Hastings doth

well then no more but this go gentle Catesby
and as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings
how he doth stand affected to our purpose
and summon him to-morrow to the Tower
to sit about the coronation
if thou dost find him tractable to us
encourage him and tell him all our reasons
if he be leaden icy-cold unwilling
be thou so too and so break off the talk
and give us notice of his inclination
for we to-morrow hold divided councils
wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd

commend me to Lord William tell him Catesby
his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
to-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle
and bid my lord for joy of this good news

good Catesby go effect this business soundly

my good lords both with all the heed I can

shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep

you shall my lord

at Crosby-place there shall you find us both


now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
lord Hastings will not yield to our complots

chop off his head something we will determine
and look when I am king claim thou of me
the earldom of Hereford and all the moveables
whereof the king my brother stood possess'd
I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand

and look to have it yielded with all kindness
come let us sup betimes that afterwards
we may digest our complots in some form


my lord my lord

who knocks

one from the Lord Stanley

what is't o'clock

upon the stroke of four


cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights
so it appears by that I have to say
first he commends him to your noble self

what then

then certifies your lordship that this night
he dreamt the boar had razed off his helm
besides he says there are two councils held
and that may be determin'd at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other
therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure
if you will presently take horse with him
and with all speed post with him towards the north
to shun the danger that his soul divines

go fellow go return unto thy lord
bid him not fear the separated councils
his honour and myself are at the one
and at the other is my good friend Catesby
whereof I shall not have intelligence
tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance
and for his dreams I wonder he's so fond
to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
to fly the boar before the boar pursues
were to incense the boar to follow us
and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
go bid thy master rise and come to me
and we will both together to the Tower
where he shall see the boar will use us kindly

I'll go my lord and tell him what you say

many good morrows to my noble lord

good morrow Catesby you are early stirring
what news what news in this our tottering state

it is a reeling world indeed my lord
till Richard wear the garland of the realm

how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown

ay my good lord

I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it

ay on my life and hopes to find you forward
upon his party for the gain thereof
and thereupon he sends you this good news
that this same very day your enemies
the kindred of the queen must die at Pomfret

indeed I am no mourner for that news
because they have been still my adversaries
but that I'll give my voice on Richard's side
God knows I will not do it to the death

God keep your lordship in that gracious mind

but I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence
that they which brought me in my master's hate
I live to look upon their tragedy
well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older
I'll send some packing that yet think not on't

'Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
when men are unprepar'd and look not for it

O monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
with Rivers Vaughan Grey and so twill do
with some men else who think themselves as safe
as thou and I who as thou know'st are dear
to princely Richard and to Buckingham



for they account his head upon the bridge

I know they do and I have well deserv'd it


come on come on where is your boar-spear man

fear you the boar and go so unprovided

my lord good morrow good morrow Catesby
you may jest on but by the holy rood
I do not like these several councils I

my lord I hold my life as dear as you do yours
and never in my days I do protest
was it so precious to me as tis now
think you but that I know our state secure

the lords at Pomfret when they rode from London
were jocund and suppos'd their state was sure
and they indeed had no cause to mistrust
but yet you see how soon the day o'ercast
this sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt
pray God I say I prove a needless coward
what shall we toward the Tower the day is spent

come come have with you Wot you what my lord
to-day the lords you talk of are beheaded

they for their truth might better wear their heads
than some that have accus'd them wear their hats
but come my lord let's away


go on before I'll talk with this good fellow


the better that your lordship please to ask

I tell thee man tis better with me now
than when I met thee last where now we meet
then was I going prisoner to the Tower
by the suggestion of the queen's allies
but now I tell thee keep it to thyself
this day those enemies are put to death
and I in better state than e'er I was

God hold it to your honour's good content

gramercy fellow there drink that for me


God save your lordship

well met my lord I am glad to see your honour
I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart
I am in your debt for your last exercise
come the next Sabbath and I will content you


what talking with a priest lord chamberlain
your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest
your honour hath no shriving work in hand

good faith and when I met this holy man
the men you talk of came into my mind
what go you toward the Tower

I do my lord but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence

nay like enough for I stay dinner there

and supper too although thou know'st it not

I'll wait upon your lordship


sir Richard Ratcliff let me tell thee this
to-day shalt thou behold a subject die
for truth for duty and for loyalty

God bless the prince from all the pack of you
a knot you are of damned blood suckers

you live that shall cry woe for this hereafter

dispatch the limit of your lives is out

O Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison
fatal and ominous to noble peers
within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the Second here was hack'd to death
we give thee up our guitless blood to drink

now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads
when she exclaim'd on Hastings you and I
for standing by when Richard stabb'd her son

then curs'd she Richard then curs'd she Buckingham
then curs'd she Hastings O remember God
to hear her prayer for them as now for us
and for my sister and her princely sons
be satisfied dear God with our true blood
which as thou know'st unjustly must be spilt

make haste the hour of death is expiate

come Grey come Vaughan let us here embrace
and take our leave until we meet in heaven

my lords at once the cause why we are met
in God's name speak when is the royal day

are all things ready for that royal time

it is and wants but nomination

to-morrow then I judge a happy day

who knows the Lord Protector's mind herein
who is most inward with the noble duke

your Grace we think should soonest know his mind

we know each other's faces for our hearts
he knows no more of mine than I of yours
nor I of his my lord than you of mine
lord Hastings you and he are near in love

I thank his Grace I know he loves me well
I have not sounded him nor he deliver'd
his gracious pleasure any way therein
but you my noble lords may name the time
and in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice
which I presume he'll take in gentle part


in happy time here comes the duke himself

my noble lords and cousins all good morrow
I have been long a sleeper but I trust
my absence doth neglect no great design
which by my presence might have been concluded

had you not come upon your cue my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part
I mean your voice for crowning of the king

than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder
my Lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them

marry and will my lord with all my heart


cousin of Buckingham a word with you

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
and finds the testy gentleman so hot
that he will lose his head ere give consent
his master's child as worshipfully he terms it
shall lose the royalty of England's throne

withdraw yourself a while I'll go with you


we have not yet set down this day of triumph
for I myself am not so well provided
as else I would be were the day prolong'd


where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester
I have sent for these strawberries

his Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning
there's some conceit or other likes him well
when that he bids good morrow with such spirit
I think there's never a man in Christendom
can lesser hide his hate or love than he
for by his face straight shall you know his heart

what of his heart perceiv'd you in his face
by any livelihood he show'd to-day

marry that with no man here he is offended
for were he he had shown it in his looks

I pray you all tell me what they deserve
that do conspire my death with devilish plots
of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd
upon my body with their hellish charms

the tender love I bear your Grace my lord
makes me most forward in this princely presence
to doom th' offenders whosoe'er they be
I say my lord they have deserved death

then be your eyes the witness of their evil
look how I am bewitch'd behold mine arm
is like a blasted sapling wither'd up
and this is Edward's wife that monstrous witch
consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore
that by their witchcraft thus have marked me

if they have done this thing my noble lord
if thou protector of this damned strumpet
talk'st thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor
off with his head now by Saint Paul I swear
I will not dine until I see the same
Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done
the rest that love me rise and follow me


woe woe for England not a whit for me
for I too fond might have prevented this
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
and I did scorn it and disdain'd to fly
three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble
and startled when he looked upon the Tower
as loath to bear me to the slaughter-house
O now I need the priest that spake to me
I now repent I told the pursuivant
as too triumphing how mine enemies
to-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd
O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse
is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head

come come dispatch the duke would be at dinner
make a short shrift he longs to see your head

O momentary grace of mortal man
which we more hunt for than the grace of God
who builds his hope in air of your good looks
lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
ready with every nod to tumble down
into the fatal bowels of the deep

come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim

O bloody Richard miserable England
I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee
that ever wretched age hath look'd upon
come lead me to the block bear him my head


come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour
murder thy breath in middle of a word
and then again begin and stop again
as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror

tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian
speak and look back and pry on every side
tremble and start at wagging of a straw
intending deep suspicion ghastly looks
are at my service like enforced smiles
and both are ready in their offices
at any time to grace my stratagems
but what is Catesby gone

he is and see he brings the mayor along



look to the drawbridge there

hark a drum

Catesby o'erlook the walls

lord Mayor the reason we have sent

look back defend thee here are enemies

God and our innocency defend and guard us


be patient they are friends Ratcliff and Lovel

here is the head of that ignoble traitor
the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings

I took him for the plainest harmless creature
that breath'd upon the earth a Christian
made him my book wherein my soul recorded
the history of all her secret thoughts
so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
that his apparent open guilt omitted
I mean his conversation with Shore's wife
he liv'd from all attainder of suspect

well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
that ever liv'd
would you imagine or almost believe
were't not that by great preservation
we live to tell it that the subtle traitor
this day had plotted in the council-house
to murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester

had he done so

or that we would against the form of law
proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
but that the extreme peril of the case
the peace of England and our person's safety
enforc'd us to this execution

now fair befall you he deserv'd his death
and your good Graces both have well proceeded
to warn false traitors from the like attempts
I never look'd for better at his hands
after he once fell in with Mistress Shore

yet had we not determin'd he should die
until your lordship came to see his end
which now the loving haste of these our friends
something against our meaning hath prevented
because my lord we would have had you heard
the traitor speak and timorously confess
the manner and the purpose of his treason
unto the citizens who haply may
misconster us in him and wail his death

but my good lord your Grace's word shall serve
as well as I had seen and heard him speak
and do not doubt right noble princes both
but I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
with all your just proceedings in this cause

and to that end we wish'd your lordship here
to avoid the censures of the carping world

but since you come too late of our intent
yet witness what you hear we did intend
and so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell


go after after cousin Buckingham
the mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post
infer the bastardy of Edward's children
tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
only for saying he would make his son
heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
which by the sign thereof was termed so
moreover urge his hateful luxury
and bestial appetite in change of lust
which stretch'd unto their servants daughters wives
even where his raging eye or savage heart
without control lusted to make a prey
nay for a need thus far come near my person
tell them when that my mother went with child
of that insatiate Edward noble York
my princely father then had wars in France
and by true computation of the time
found that the issue was not his begot
which well appeared in his lineaments
being nothing like the noble duke my father
yet touch this sparingly as twere far off

doubt not my lord I'll play the orator
as if the golden fee for which I plead
were for myself and so my lord adieu

if you thrive well bring them to Baynard's Castle
where you shall find me well accompanied
with reverend fathers and well-learned bishops

I go and towards three or four o'clock
look for the news that the Guildhall affords


go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw


go thou to Friar Penker bid them both
meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle

to draw the brats of Clarence out of sight
and to give notice that no manner person
have any time recourse unto the princes


here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings
which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
that it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's
and mark how well the sequel hangs together
eleven hours I have spent to write it over
for yesternight by Catesby was it sent me
the precedent was full as long a-doing
and yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd
untainted unexamin'd free at liberty
here's a good world the while Who is so gross
that cannot see this palpable device
yet who so bold but says he sees it not
bad is the world and all will come to naught
when such ill dealing must be seen in thought

how now how now what say the citizens

now by the holy mother of our Lord
the citizens are mum say not a word

touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children

I did with his contract with Lady Lucy
and his contract by deputy in France
the insatiate greediness of his desires
and his enforcement of the city wives
his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
as being got your father then in France
and his resemblance being not like the duke
withal I did infer your lineaments
being the right idea of your father
both in your form and nobleness of mind
laid open all your victories in Scotland
your bounty virtue fair humility
indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose
untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse
and when my oratory drew toward end
I bade them that did love their country's good
cry God save Richard England's royal king

and did they so

no so God help me they spake not a word
but like dumb statuas or breathing stones
star'd each on other and look'd deadly pale
which when I saw I reprehended them
and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence
his answer was the people were not wont
to be spoke to but by the recorder
then he was urg'd to tell my tale again
'Thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd
but nothing spoke in warrant from himself
at lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps
and some ten voices cried God save King Richard
and thus I took the vantage of those few
'Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I
'This general applause and cheerful shout
argues your wisdom and your love to Richard
and even here brake off and came away

what tongueless blocks were they would they not speak
will not the mayor then and his brethren come

the mayor is here at hand Intend some fear
be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
and look you get a prayer-book in your hand
and stand between two churchmen good my lord
for on that ground I'll make a holy descant
and be not easily won to our requests
play the maid's part still answer nay and take it

as I can say nay to thee for myself
no doubt we bring it to a happy issue

go go up to the leads the Lord Mayor knocks

welcome my lord I dance attendance here
I think the duke will not be spoke withal


now Catesby what says your lord to my request

he doth entreat your Grace my noble lord
to visit him to-morrow or next day
he is within with two right reverend fathers
divinely bent to meditation
and in no worldly suit would he be mov'd
to draw him from his holy exercise

return good Catesby to the gracious duke
in deep designs in matter of great moment
no less importing than our general good
are come to have some conference with his Grace

I'll signify so much unto him straight


Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward
he is not lolling on a lewd day-bed
but on his knees at meditation
not dallying with a brace of courtezans
but meditating with two deep divines
not sleeping to engross his idle body
but praying to enrich his watchful soul
happy were England would this virtuous prince
take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof
but sore I fear we shall not win him to it

marry God defend his Grace should say us nay
I fear he will Here Catesby comes again

now Catesby what says his Grace

he wonders to what end you have assembled
such troops of citizens to come to him
his Grace not being warn'd thereof before
my lord he fears you mean no good to him

sorry I am my noble cousin should
suspect me that I mean no good to him
by heaven we come to him in perfect love
and so once more return and tell his Grace

when holy and devout religious men
are at their beads tis much to draw them thence
so sweet is zealous contemplation



two props of virtue for a Christian prince
to stay him from the fall of vanity
and see a book of prayer in his hand
true ornament to know a holy man
famous Plantagenet most gracious prince
lend favourable ear to our requests
and pardon us the interruption
of thy devotion and right Christian zeal

my lord there needs no such apology
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me
who earnest in the service of my God
deferr'd the visitation of my friends
but leaving this what is your Grace's pleasure

even that I hope which pleaseth God above
and all good men of this ungovern'd isle

that seems disgracious in the city's eye
and that you come to reprehend my ignorance

you have my lord would it might please your Grace
on our entreaties to amend your fault

else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land

know then it is your fault that you resign
the supreme seat the throne majestical
the sceptred office of your ancestors
your state of fortune and your due of birth
the lineal glory of your royal house
to the corruption of a blemish'd stock
whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
which here we waken to our country's good
this noble isle doth want her proper limbs
her face defac'd with scars of infamy
her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
which to recure we heartily solicit
your gracious self to take on you the charge
and kingly government of this your land
not as protector steward substitute
or lowly factor for another's gain
but as successively from blood to blood
your right of birth your empery your own
for this consorted with the citizens
your very worshipful and loving friends
and by their vehement instigation
in this just cause come I to move your Grace

I cannot tell if to depart in silence
or bitterly to speak in your reproof
best fitteth my degree or your condition
if not to answer you might haply think
tongue-tied ambition not replying yielded
to bear the golden yoke of sov'reignty
if to reprove you for this suit of yours
so season'd with your faithful love to me
then on the other side I check'd my friends
therefore to speak and to avoid the first
and then in speaking not to incur the last
definitively thus I answer you
your love deserves my thanks but my desert
unmeritable shuns your high request
first if all obstacles were cut away
and that my path were even to the crown
as the ripe revenue and due of birth
yet so much is my poverty of spirit
so mighty and so many my defects
that I would rather hide me from my greatness
being a bark to brook no mighty sea
than in my greatness covet to be hid
and in the vapour of my glory smother'd
but God be thank'd there is no need of me
and much I need to help you were there need
which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time
will well become the seat of majesty
and make no doubt us happy by his reign
on him I lay that you would lay on me
the right and fortune of his happy stars
which God defend that I should wring from him

my lord this argues conscience in your Grace
but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
all circumstances well considered
you say that Edward is your brother's son
so say we too but not by Edward's wife
for first was he contract to Lady Lucy
your mother lives a witness to his vow
and afterward by substitute betroth'd
to Bona sister to the King of France
these both put by a poor petitioner
a care-craz'd mother to a many sons
a beauty-waning and distressed widow
made prize and purchase of his wanton eye
seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
to base declension and loath'd bigamy
by her in his unlawful bed he got
this Edward whom our manners call the prince
more bitterly could I expostulate
save that for reverence to some alive
I give a sparing limit to my tongue
then good my lord take to your royal self
this proffer'd benefit of dignity
if not to bless us and the land withal
yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
from the corruption of abusing times
unto a lineal true-derived course

do good my lord your citizens entreat you

refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love


alas why would you heap those cares on me
I am unfit for state and majesty
I do beseech you take it not amiss
I cannot nor I will not yield to you

if you refuse it as in love and zeal
loath to depose the child your brother's son
as well we know your tenderness of heart
and gentle kind effeminate remorse
which we have noted in you to your kindred
and egally indeed to all estates
yet whether you accept our suit or no
your brother's son shall never reign our king
but we will plant some other in the throne
to the disgrace and downfall of your house
and in this resolution here we leave you
come citizens we will entreat no more

call them again sweet prince accept their suit
if you deny them all the land will rue it

will you enforce me to a world of cares
call them again I am not made of stone
but penetrable to your kind entreats

albeit against my conscience and my soul


cousin of Buckingham and sage grave men
since you will buckle fortune on my back
to bear her burden whe'r I will or no
I must have patience to endure the load
but if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
attend the sequel of your imposition
your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
from all the impure blots and stains thereof
for God doth know and you may partly see
how far I am from the desire of this

God bless your Grace we see it and will say it

in saying so you shall but say the truth

then I salute you with this royal title
long live King Richard England's worthy king

amen

to-morrow may it please you to be crown'd

even when you please for you will have it so

to-morrow then we will attend your Grace
and so most joyfully we take our leave

come let us to our holy work again

who meets us here my niece Plantagenet
led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester
now for my life she's wand'ring to the Tower
on pure heart's love to greet the tender princes
daughter well met

God give your Graces both
a happy and a joyful time of day

as much to you good sister whither away

no further than the Tower and as I guess
upon the like devotion as yourselves
to gratulate the gentle princes there

kind sister thanks we'll enter all together


master lieutenant pray you by your leave

how doth the prince and my young son of York

right well dear madam By your patience
I may not suffer you to visit them
the king hath strictly charg'd the contrary

the king who's that

I mean the Lord Protector

the Lord protect him from that kingly title
hath he set bounds between their love and me
I am their mother who shall bar me from them

I am their father's mother I will see them

their aunt I am in law in love their mother
and take thy office from thee on my peril

no madam no I may not leave it so
I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me

let me but meet you ladies one hour hence
and I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
and reverend looker-on of two fair queens


come madam you must straight to Westminster
there to be crowned Richard's royal queen

Ah cut my lace asunder
that my pent heart may have some scope to beat
or else I swoon with this dead-killing news

despiteful tidings O unpleasing news


O Dorset speak not to me get thee gone
death and destruction dog thee at the heels
thy mother's name is ominous to children
if thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas
and live with Richmond from the reach of hell
go hie thee hie thee from this slaughter-house
lest thou increase the number of the dead
and make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse
nor mother wife nor England's counted queen

full of wise care is this your counsel madam


take all the swift advantage of the hours
you shall have letters from me to my son
in your behalf to meet you on the way
be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay

O my accursed womb the bed of death
a cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world
whose unavoided eye is murderous

come madam come I in all haste was sent

and I with all unwillingness will go
O would to God that the inclusive verge
of golden metal that must round my brow
were red-hot steel to sear me to the brain
anointed let me be with deadly venom
and die ere men can say God save the queen

go go poor soul I envy not thy glory
to feed my humour wish thyself no harm

no why When he that is my husband now
came to me as I follow'd Henry's corse
when scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
and that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd
O when I say I look'd on Richard's face
this was my wish Be thou quoth I accurs'd
for making me so young so old a widow
and when thou wedd'st let sorrow haunt thy bed
and be thy wife if any be so mad
more miserable by the life of thee
than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death
lo ere I can repeat this curse again
within so small a time my woman's heart
grossly grew captive to his honey words
and prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse
which hitherto hath held mine eyes from rest
for never yet one hour in his bed
did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep
but with his timorous dreams was still awak'd
besides he hates me for my father Warwick
and will no doubt shortly be rid of me


no more than with my soul I mourn for yours

farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory

adieu poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it

go thou to Richmond and good fortune guide thee


go thou to Richard and good angels tend thee


go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee
I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen
and each hour's joy wrack'd with a week of teen

stay yet look back with me unto the Tower
whom envy hath immur'd within your walls
rough cradle for such little pretty ones
rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
for tender princes use my babies well
so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell


stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham

my gracious sovereign

give me thy hand

thus high by thy advice
and thy assistance is King Richard seated
but shall we wear these glories for a day
or shall they last and we rejoice in them

still live they and for ever let them last
Ah Buckingham now do I play the touch
to try if thou be current gold indeed
young Edward lives think now what I would speak

say on my loving lord

why Buckingham I say I would be king

why so you are my thrice-renowned liege

ha am I king Tis so but Edward lives

true noble prince

O bitter consequence
that Edward still should live True noble prince
cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull
shall I be plain I wish the bastards dead
and I would have it suddenly perform'd

your Grace may do your pleasure

tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes
say have I thy consent that they shall die

give me some little breath some pause dear lord
before I positively speak in this
I will resolve you herein presently


the king is angry see he gnaws his lip

I will converse with iron-witted fools
and unrespective boys none are for me
that look into me with considerate eyes
high-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect
boy


know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
will tempt unto a close exploit of death

I know a discontented gentleman
whose humble means match not his haughty spirit
gold were as good as twenty orators
and will no doubt tempt him to anything

what is his name

his name my lord is Tyrrell

I partly know the man go call him hither

the deep-revolving witty Buckingham
no more shall be the neighbour to my counsel
hath he so long held out with me untir'd
and stops he now for breath well be it so
how now Lord Stanley what's the news

know my loving lord
the Marquess Dorset as I hear is fled
to Richmond in the parts where he abides

come hither Catesby rumour it abroad
that Anne my wife is very grievous sick
I will take order for her keeping close
inquire me out some mean poor gentleman
whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter
the boy is foolish and I fear not him
look how thou dream'st I say again give out
that Anne my queen is sick and like to die
about it for it stands me much upon
to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me

I must be married to my brother's daughter
or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass
uncertain way of gain But I am in
so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin
tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye

is thy name Tyrrell

James Tyrrell and your most obedient subject

art thou indeed

prove me my gracious lord

dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine

please you but I had rather kill two enemies

why then thou hast it two deep enemies
foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
are they that I would have thee deal upon

let me have open means to come to them
and soon I'll rid you from the fear of them

thou sing'st sweet music Hark come hither Tyrrell
go by this token rise and lend thine ear

there is no more but so say it is done
and I will love thee and prefer thee for it

I will dispatch it straight

my lord I have consider'd in my mind
the late demand that you did sound me in

well let that rest Dorset is fled to Richmond

I hear the news my lord


my lord I claim the gift my due by promise
for which your honour and your faith is pawn'd
the earldom of Hereford and the moveables
which you have promised I shall possess

Stanley look to your wife if she convey
letters to Richmond you shall answer it

what says your highness to my just request

I do remember me Henry the Sixth
did prophesy that Richmond should be king
when Richmond was a little peevish boy
a king perhaps

my lord

how chance the prophet could not at that time

my lord your promise for the earldom

Richmond When last I was at Exeter
the mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle
and call'd it Rougemont at which name I started
because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw Richmond

my lord

ay what's o'clock

I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
of what you promis'd me

well but what is't o'clock

upon the stroke of ten
well let it strike

why let it strike

because that like a Jack thou keep'st the stroke
betwixt thy begging and my meditation
I am not in the giving vein to-day

why then resolve me whe'r you will or no

thou troublest me I am not in the vein


and is it thus repays he my deep service
with such contempt made I him king for this
O let me think on Hastings and be gone
to Brecknock while my fearful head is on


the most arch deed of piteous massacre
that ever yet this land was guilty of
Dighton and Forrest whom I did suborn
to do this piece of ruthless butchery
albeit they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs
melting with tenderness and mild compassion
wept like to children in their death's sad story
'Oh thus quoth Dighton lay the gentle babes
'Thus thus quoth Forrest girdling one another
within their alabaster innocent arms
their lips were four red roses on a stalk
which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other
a book of prayers on their pillow lay
which once quoth Forrest almost chang'd my mind
but O the devil' there the villain stopp'd
when Dighton thus told on We smothered
the most replenished sweet work of nature
that from the prime creation e'er she fram'd
hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
to bear this tidings to the bloody king
and here he comes

all health my sovereign lord

kind Tyrrell am I happy in thy news

if to have done the thing you gave in charge
beget your happiness be happy then
for it is done

but didst thou see them dead

I did my lord

and buried gentle Tyrrell

the chaplain of the Tower hath buried them
but how or in what place I do not know
come to me Tyrrell soon at after-supper
when thou shalt tell the process of their death
meantime but think how I may do thee good
and be inheritor of thy desire
farewell till then

I humbly take my leave


the son of Clarence have I pent up close
his daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage
the sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom
and Anne my wife hath bid the world good night
now for I know the Breton Richmond aims
at young Elizabeth my brother's daughter
and by that knot looks proudly on the crown
to her go I a jolly thriving wooer



good or bad news that thou com'st in so bluntly

bad news my lord Morton is fled to Richmond
and Buckingham back'd with the hardy Welshmen
is in the field and still his power increaseth

Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength
come I have learn'd that fearful commenting
is leaden servitor to dull delay
delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beggary
then fiery expedition be my wing
Jove's Mercury and herald for a king
go muster men my counsel is my shield
we must be brief when traitors brave the field


so now prosperity begins to mellow
here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
to watch the waning of mine enemies
a dire induction am I witness to
and will to France hoping the consequence
will prove as bitter black and tragical
withdraw thee wretched Margaret who comes here


Ah my poor princes ah my tender babes
my unblown flowers new-appearing sweets
if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
and be not fix'd in doom perpetual
hover about me with your airy wings
and hear your mother's lamentation

hover about her say that right for right
hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night

so many miseries have craz'd my voice
Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead

Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt

wilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambs
and throw them in the entrails of the wolf
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done

when holy Harry died and my sweet son

dead life blind sight poor mortal living ghost
woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd
brief abstract and record of tedious days
rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth

unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood

Ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave
then would I hide my bones not rest them here
Ah who hath any cause to mourn but I


if ancient sorrow be most reverend
give mine the benefit of seniory
and let my griefs frown on the upper hand
if sorrow can admit society

tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine
I had an Edward till a Richard kill'd him
I had a Harry till a Richard kill'd him
thou hadst an Edward till a Richard kill'd him
thou hadst a Richard till a Richard kill'd him

I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him
I had a Rutland too thou holp'st to kill him

thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard kill'd him
a hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
that dog that had his teeth before his eyes
to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
that foul defacer of God's handiwork
that excellent grand-tyrant of the earth
that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
O upright just and true-disposing God
how do I thank thee that this carnal cur
preys on the issue of his mother's body
and makes her pew-fellow with others' moan

O Harry's wife triumph not in my woes
God witness with me I have wept for thine

bear with me I am hungry for revenge
and now I cloy me with beholding it
thy Edward he is dead that kill'd my Edward
thy other Edward dead to quit my Edward
match not the high perfection of my loss
thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward
and the beholders of this tragic play
the adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey
untimely smother'd in their dusky graves
Richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer
only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
and send them thither but at hand at hand
ensues his piteous and unpitied end
earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
to have him suddenly convey'd from hence
cancel his bond of life dear God I pray
that I may live to say The dog is dead

O thou didst prophesy the time would come
that I should wish for thee to help me curse
that bottled spider that foul bunchback'd toad

I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune
the presentation of but what I was
the flattering index of a direful pageant
one heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below
a mother only mock'd with two fair babes
a dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble
a sign of dignity a garish flag
to be the aim of every dangerous shot
a queen in jest only to fill the scene
where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
where are thy children wherein dost thou joy
who sues and kneels and cries God save the queen
where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee
where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee
decline all this and see what now thou art
for happy wife a most distressed widow
for joyful mother one that wails the name
for one being su'd to one that humbly sues
for queen a very caitiff crown'd with care
for one that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me
for one commanding all obey'd of none
thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about
and left thee but a very prey to time
having no more but thought of what thou wert
to torture thee the more being what thou art
thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke
from which even here I slip my wearied head
and leave the burden of it all on thee
farewell York's wife and queen of sad mischance
these English woes shall make me smile in France

O thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile
and teach me how to curse mine enemies

forbear to sleep the night and fast the day
compare dead happiness with living woe
think that thy babes were fairer than they were
bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse
revolving this will teach thee how to curse

my words are dull O quicken them with thine

thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine


why should calamity be full of words

windy attorneys to their client woes
airy succeeders of intestate joys
poor breathing orators of miseries
let them have scope though what they do impart
help nothing else yet do they ease the heart

if so then be not tongue-tied go with me
and in the breath of bitter words let's smother
my damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd
the trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims


who intercepts me in my expedition

O she that might have intercepted thee
by strangling thee in her accursed womb
from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done

hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown
where should be branded if that right were right
the slaughter of the prince that ow'd that crown
and the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
tell me thou villain slave where are my children

thou toad thou toad where is thy brother Clarence
and little Ned Plantagenet his son

where is the gentle Rivers Vaughan Grey
where is kind Hastings

a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
rail on the Lord's anointed Strike I say

either be patient and entreat me fair
or with the clamorous report of war
thus will I drown your exclamations

art thou my son

ay I thank God my father and yourself

then patiently hear my impatience

madam I have a touch of your condition
that cannot brook the accent of reproof


do then but I'll not hear

I will be mild and gentle in my words

and brief good mother for I am in haste

art thou so hasty I have stay'd for thee
God knows in torment and in agony

and came I not at last to comfort you

no by the holy rood thou know'st it well
thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell
a grievous burden was thy birth to me
tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
thy school-days frightful desperate wild and furious
thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
thy age confirm'd proud subtle sly and bloody
what comfortable hour canst thou name
that ever grac'd me in thy company

faith none but Humphrey Hour that call'd your Grace
to breakfast once forth of my company
if I be so disgracious in your eye
let me march on and not offend you madam
strike up the drum

I prithee hear me speak

you speak too bitterly

hear me a word
for I shall never speak to thee again

so

either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
and never look upon thy face again
therefore take with thee my most grievous curse
which in the day of battle tire thee more
than all the complete armour that thou wear'st
my prayers on the adverse party fight
and there the little souls of Edward's children
whisper the spirits of thine enemies
and promise them success and victory
bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend


though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
abides in me I say amen to her


stay madam I must talk a word with you

for thee to slaughter for my daughters Richard
they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
and therefore level not to hit their lives

you have a daughter call'd Elizabeth
virtuous and fair royal and gracious

and must she die for this O let her live
and I'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty
slander myself as false to Edward's bed
throw over her the veil of infamy
so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter

wrong not her birth she is of royal blood

to save her life I'll say she is not so

her life is safest only in her birth
and only in that safety died her brothers

lo at their births good stars were opposite

no to their lives ill friends were contrary

all unavoided is the doom of destiny

true when avoided grace makes destiny
my babes were destin'd to a fairer death
if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life

you speak as if that I had slain my cousins

cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen'd
of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
whose hands soever lanc'd their tender hearts
thy head all indirectly gave direction
no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
to revel in the entrails of my lambs
but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes
and I in such a desperate bay of death
like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom

madam so thrive I in my enterprise
and dangerous success of bloody wars
as I intend more good to you and yours
than ever you or yours by me were harm'd

what good is cover'd with the face of heaven
to be discover'd that can do me good

the advancement of your children gentle lady

up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
no to the dignity and height of fortune
the high imperial type of this earth's glory

flatter my sorrow with report of it
tell me what state what dignity what honour
canst thou demise to any child of mine

even all I have ay and myself and all
will I withal endow a child of thine
so in the Lethe of thy angry soul
thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
which thou supposest I have done to thee

be brief lest that the process of thy kindness
last longer telling than thy kindness' date

then know that from my soul I love thy daughter

my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul
what do you think

that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers
and from my heart's love I do thank thee for it

be not too hasty to confound my meaning
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
and do intend to make her Queen of England

well then who dost thou mean shall be her king

even he that makes her queen who else should be

what thou

even so what think you of it

how canst thou woo her
that I would learn of you
as one being best acquainted with her humour

and wilt thou learn of me

madam with all my heart

send to her by the man that slew her brothers
a pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave
Edward and York then haply will she weep
therefore present to her as sometime Margaret
did to thy father steep'd in Rutland's blood
a handkerchief which say to her did drain
the purple sap from her sweet brother's body
and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
if this inducement move her not to love
send her a letter of thy noble deeds
tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence
her uncle Rivers ay and for her sake

you mock me madam this is not the way
to win your daughter

there is no other way
unless thou couldst put on some other shape
and not be Richard that hath done all this

say that I did all this for love of her

nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
having bought love with such a bloody spoil

look what is done cannot be now amended
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
which after-hours give leisure to repent
if I did take the kingdom from your sons
to make amends I'll give it to your daughter
if I have kill'd the issue of your womb
mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
a grandam's name is little less in love
than is the doting title of a mother
they are as children but one step below
even of your mettle of your very blood
of all one pain save for a night of groans
endur'd of her for whom you bid like sorrow
your children were vexation to your youth
but mine shall be a comfort to your age
the loss you have is but a son being king
and by that loss your daughter is made queen
I cannot make you what amends I would
therefore accept such kindness as I can
Dorset your son that with a fearful soul
leads discontented steps in foreign soil
this fair alliance quickly shall call home
to high promotions and great dignity
the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother
and all the ruins of distressful times
repair'd with double riches of content
what we have many goodly days to see
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
shall come again transform'd to orient pearl
advantaging their loan with interest
of ten times double gain of happiness
go then my mother to thy daughter go
make bold her bashful years with your experience
prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
and when this arm of mine hath chastised
the petty rebel dull-brain'd Buckingham
bound with triumphant garlands will I come
and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed
to whom I will retail my conquest won
and she shall be sole victress C sar's C sar
what were I best to say her father's brother
would be her lord Or shall I say her uncle
or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
under what title shall I woo for thee
that God the law my honour and her love
can make seem pleasing to her tender years

infer fair England's peace by this alliance

which she shall purchase with still lasting war

tell her the king that may command entreats

that at her hands which the king's King forbids

say she shall be a high and mighty queen

to wail the title as her mother doth


but how long shall that title ever' last

sweetly in force unto her fair life's end

but how long fairly shall her sweet life last

as long as heaven and nature lengthens it

as long as hell and Richard likes of it

say I her sovereign am her subject low

but she your subject loathes such sovereignty

be eloquent in my behalf to her

an honest tale speeds best being plainly told


plain and not honest is too harsh a style

your reasons are too shallow and too quick

O no my reasons are too deep and dead
too deep and dead poor infants in their graves

harp not on that string madam that is past

harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break

now by my George my garter and my crown

profan'd dishonour'd and the third usurp'd

I swear

by nothing for this is no oath
thy garter blemish'd pawn'd his knightly virtue
thy crown usurp'd disgrac'd his kingly glory
if something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd
swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd

now by the world

'Tis full of thy foul wrongs

my father's death

thy life hath that dishonour'd

then by myself

thyself is self-misus'd

why then by God

if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
the unity the king my husband made
had not been broken nor my brothers died
if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
the imperial metal circling now thy head
had grac'd the tender temples of my child
and both the princes had been breathing here
which now too tender bed-fellows for dust
thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
what canst thou swear by now

the time to come

that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast
for I myself have many tears to wash
hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee
the children live whose parents thou hast slaughter'd
ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age
the parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd
swear not by time to come for that thou hast
misus'd ere us'd by times ill-us'd o'erpast

as I intend to prosper and repent
so thrive I in my dangerous affairs
of hostile arms myself myself confound
heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
be opposite all planets of good luck
to my proceeding if with pure heart's love
immaculate devotion holy thoughts
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
in her consists my happiness and thine
without her follows to myself and thee
herself the land and many a Christian soul
death desolation ruin and decay
it cannot be avoided but by this
it will not be avoided but by this
therefore dear mother I must call you so
plead what I will be not what I have been
not my deserts but what I will deserve
urge the necessity and state of times
and be not peevish-fond in great designs

shall I be tempted of the devil thus

ay if the devil tempt thee to do good

shall I forget myself to be myself

ay if your self's remembrance wrong yourself

yet thou didst kill my children

but in your daughter's womb I bury them
where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
selves of themselves to your recomforture


and be a happy mother by the deed

I go Write to me very shortly
and you shall understand from me her mind

bear her my true love's kiss and so farewell

relenting fool and shallow changing woman

how now what news

most mighty sovereign on the western coast
rideth a puissant navy to the shores
throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends
unarm'd and unresolv'd to beat them back
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral
and there they hull expecting but the aid
of Buckingham to welcome them ashore
some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk
Ratcliff thyself or Catesby where is he

here my good lord

Catesby fly to the duke

I will my lord with all convenient haste

Ratcliff come hither Post to Salisbury
when thou com'st thither

dull unmindful villain
why stay'st thou here and go'st not to the duke

first mighty liege tell me your highness' pleasure
what from your Grace I shall deliver to him

O true good Catesby bid him levy straight
and meet me suddenly at Salisbury

I go


what may it please you shall I do at Salisbury

why what wouldst thou do there before I go

your highness told me I should post before


my mind is chang'd Stanley what news with you

none good my liege to please you with the hearing
nor none so bad but well may be reported

hoyday a riddle neither good nor bad
what need'st thou run so many miles about
once more what news

Richmond is on the seas

there let him sink and be the seas on him
white-liver'd runagate what doth he there

I know not mighty sovereign but by guess

well as you guess

stirr'd up by Dorset Buckingham and Morton
he makes for England here to claim the crown

is the chair empty is the sword unsway'd
is the king dead the empire unpossess'd
what heir of York is there alive but we
and who is England's king but great York's heir
then tell me what makes he upon the seas
unless for that my liege I cannot guess

unless for that he comes to be your liege
you cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes
thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear

no my good lord therefore mistrust me not

where is thy power then to beat him back
where be thy tenants and thy followers
are they not now upon the western shore
safe-conducting the rebels from their ships

no my good lord my friends are in the north

cold friends to me what do they in the north
when they should serve their sovereign in the west

they have not been commanded mighty king
I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace
where and what time your majesty shall please

ay ay thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond
but I'll not trust thee

most mighty sovereign
you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful
I never was nor never will be false

go then and muster men but leave behind
your son George Stanley look your heart be firm
or else his head's assurance is but frail

so deal with him as I prove true to you

my gracious sovereign now in Devonshire
as I by friends am well advertised
sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate
with many moe confederates are in arms


in Kent my liege the Guildfords are in arms
and every hour more competitors
flock to the rebels and their power grows strong


my lord the army of great Buckingham

out on ye owls nothing but songs of death

there take thou that till thou bring better news

the news I have to tell your majesty
is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd
and he himself wander'd away alone
no man knows whither
I cry thee mercy
there is my purse to cure that blow of thine
hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
reward to him that brings the traitor in

such proclamation hath been made my liege


sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquess Dorset
'Tis said my liege in Yorkshire are in arms
but this good comfort bring I to your highness
the Breton navy is dispers'd by tempest
Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
unto the shore to ask those on the banks
if they were his assistants yea or no
who answer'd him they came from Buckingham
upon his party he mistrusting them
hois'd sail and made away for Brittany

if not to fight with foreign enemies
yet to beat down these rebels here at home


my liege the Duke of Buckingham is taken
that is the best news that the Earl of Richmond
is with a mighty power landed at Milford
is colder news but yet they must be told

away towards Salisbury while we reason here
a royal battle might be won and lost
some one take order Buckingham be brought
to Salisbury the rest march on with me


sir Christopher tell Richmond this from me
that in the sty of this most bloody boar
my son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold
if I revolt off goes young George's head
so get thee gone commend me to thy lord
withal say that the queen hath heartily consented
he should espouse Elizabeth her daughter
but tell me where is princely Richmond now

at Pembroke or at Ha'rford-west in Wales

what men of name resort to him

sir Walter Herbert a renowned soldier
sir Gilbert Talbot Sir William Stanley
Oxford redoubted Pembroke Sir James Blunt
and Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew
and many other of great name and worth
and towards London do they bend their power
if by the way they be not fought withal

well hie thee to thy lord I kiss his hand
my letter will resolve him of my mind

will not King Richard let me speak with him

no my good lord therefore be patient

Hastings and Edward's children Grey and Rivers
holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward
Vaughan and all that have miscarried
by underhand corrupted foul injustice
if that your moody discontented souls
do through the clouds behold this present hour
even for revenge mock my destruction
this is All-Souls' day fellows is it not

it is my lord

why then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday
this is the day that in King Edward's time
I wish'd might fall on me when I was found
this is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
by the false faith of him whom most I trusted
this this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
is the determin'd respite of my wrongs
that high All-Seer which I dallied with
hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
and given in earnest what I begg'd in jest
thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
to turn their own points on their masters' bosoms
thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck
'When he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow
remember Margaret was a prophetess
come lead me officers to the block of shame
wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame

fellows in arms and my most loving friends
bruis'd underneath the yoke of tyranny
thus far into the bowels of the land
have we march'd on without impediment
lines of fair comfort and encouragement
the wretched bloody and usurping boar
that spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines
swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
in your embowell'd bosoms this foul swine
is now even in the centre of this isle
near to the town of Leicester as we learn
from Tamworth thither is but one day's march
in God's name cheerly on courageous friends
to reap the harvest of perpetual peace
by this one bloody trial of sharp war

every man's conscience is a thousand men
to fight against this guilty homicide

I doubt not but his friends will turn to us

he hath no friends but what are friends for fear
which in his dearest need will fly from him
all for our vantage then in God's name march
true hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings
kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings


here pitch our tent even here in Bosworth field
my Lord of Surrey why look you so sad

my heart is ten times lighter than my looks

my Lord of Norfolk

here most gracious liege

Norfolk we must have knocks ha must we not

we must both give and take my loving lord

up with my tent here will I lie to-night
but where to-morrow Well all's one for that
who hath descried the number of the traitors

six or seven thousand is their utmost power

why our battalia trebles that account
besides the king's name is a tower of strength
which they upon the adverse faction want
up with the tent Come noble gentlemen
let us survey the vantage of the ground
call for some men of sound direction
let's lack no discipline make no delay
for lords to-morrow is a busy day


the weary sun hath made a golden set
and by the bright track of his fiery car
gives token of a goodly day to-morrow
sir William Brandon you shall bear my standard
I'll draw the form and model of our battle
limit each leader to his several charge
and part in just proportion our small power
my Lord of Oxford you Sir William Brandon
and you Sir Walter Herbert stay with me
the Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment
good Captain Blunt bear my good-night to him
and by the second hour in the morning
desire the earl to see me in my tent
yet one thing more good captain do for me
where is Lord Stanley quarter'd do you know

unless I have mista'en his colours much
which well I am assur'd I have not done
his regiment lies half a mile at least
south from the mighty power of the king

if without peril it be possible
good Captain Blunt bear my good-night to him

upon my life my lord I'll undertake it
and so God give you quiet rest to-night

good-night good Captain Blunt Come gentlemen
let us consult upon to-morrow's business
in to my tent the air is raw and cold

what is t o'clock

it's supper-time my lord
it's nine o'clock

I will not sup to-night
give me some ink and paper
what is my beaver easier than it was
and all my armour laid into my tent

it is my liege and all things are in readiness
good Norfolk hie thee to thy charge
use careful watch choose trusty sentinels

I go my lord

stir with the lark to-morrow gentle Norfolk

I warrant you my lord


Ratcliff

my lord

send out a pursuivant at arms
to Stanley's regiment bid him bring his power
before sun-rising lest his son George fall
into the blind cave of eternal night
fill me a bowl of wine Give me a watch
look that my staves be sound and not too heavy
Ratcliff

my lord

saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland

Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself
much about cock-shut time from troop to troop
went through the army cheering up the soldiers

so I am satisfied Give me a bowl of wine
I have not that alacrity of spirit
nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have
set it down Is ink and paper ready

it is my lord

bid my guard watch leave me
and help to arm me Leave me I say


fortune and victory sit on thy helm

all comfort that the dark night can afford
be to thy person noble father-in-law
tell me how fares our loving mother

I by attorney bless thee from thy mother
who prays continually for Richmond's good
so much for that The silent hours steal on
and flaky darkness breaks within the east
in brief for so the season bids us be
prepare thy battle early in the morning
and put thy fortune to the arbitrement
of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war
I as I may that which I would I cannot
with best advantage will deceive the time
but on thy side I may not be too forward
lest being seen thy brother tender George
be executed in his father's sight
farewell the leisure and the fearful time
cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
and ample interchange of sweet discourse
which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon
God give us leisure for these rites of love
once more adieu be valiant and speed well

good lords conduct him to his regiment
I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap
lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow
when I should mount with wings of victory
once more good-night kind lords and gentlemen

O thou whose captain I account myself
look on my forces with a gracious eye
put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath
the usurping helmets of our adversaries
make us thy ministers of chastisement
that we may praise thee in thy victory
to thee I do commend my watchful soul
ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes
sleeping and waking O defend me still

let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow
think how thou stab'dst me in my prime of youth
at Tewksbury despair therefore and die
be cheerful Richmond for the wronged souls
of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
king Henry's issue Richmond comforts thee


when I was mortal my anointed body
by thee was punched full of deadly holes
think on the Tower and me despair and die
Henry the Sixth bids thee despair and die

virtuous and holy be thou conqueror
Harry that prophesied thou shouldst be the king
doth comfort thee in thy sleep live thou and flourish


let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow
I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine
poor Clarence by thy guile betray'd to death
to-morrow in the battle think on me
and fall thy edgeless sword despair and die


thou offspring of the house of Lancaster
the wronged heirs of York do pray for thee
good angels guard thy battle live and flourish


let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow

think upon Grey and let thy soul despair

think upon Vaughan and with guilty fear
let fall thy pointless lance despair and die

awake and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom
will conquer him awake and win the day


bloody and guilty guiltily awake
and in a bloody battle end thy days
think on Lord Hastings so despair and die


quiet untroubled soul awake awake
arm fight and conquer for fair England's sake


let us be lead within thy bosom Richard
and weigh thee down to ruin shame and death
thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die


sleep Richmond sleep in peace and wake in joy
good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy
live and beget a happy race of kings
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish


Richard thy wife that wretched Anne thy wife
that never slept a quiet hour with thee
now fills thy sleep with perturbations
to-morrow in the battle think on me
and fall thy edgeless sword despair and die


thou quiet soul sleep thou a quiet sleep
thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee


the first was I that help'd thee to the crown
the last was I that felt thy tyranny
O in the battle think on Buckingham
and die in terror of thy guiltiness
dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death
fainting despair despairing yield thy breath


I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid
but cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd
God and good angels fight on Richmond's side
and Richard falls in height of all his pride


give me another horse bind up my wounds
have mercy Jesu Soft I did but dream
the lights burn blue It is now dead midnight
cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh
what do I fear myself there's none else by
Richard loves Richard that is I am I
is there a murderer here No Yes I am
then fly what from myself Great reason why
lest I revenge What myself upon myself
alack I love myself Wherefore for any good
that I myself have done unto myself
O no alas I rather hate myself
for hateful deeds committed by myself
I am a villain Yet I lie I am not
fool of thyself speak well fool do not flatter
my conscience hath a thousand several tongues
and every tongue brings in a several tale
and every tale condemns me for a villain
perjury perjury in the high'st degree
murder stern murder in the dir'st degree
all several sins all us'd in each degree
I shall despair There is no creature loves me
and if I die no soul will pity me
nay wherefore should they since that I myself
find in myself no pity to myself
methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
came to my tent and every one did threat
to-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard


my lord

'Zounds who's there

Ratcliff my lord tis I The early village cock
hath twice done salutation to the morn
your friends are up and buckle on their armour

O Ratcliff I have dream'd a fearful dream
what thinkest thou will our friends prove all true
no doubt my lord

O Ratcliff I fear I fear

nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows

by the apostle Paul shadows to-night
have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond
it is not yet near day Come go with me
under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper
to hear if any mean to shrink from me

good morrow Richmond

cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen
that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here


the sweetest sleep the fairest-boding dreams
that ever enter'd in a drowsy head
have I since your departure had my lords
methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd
came to my tent and cried on victory
I promise you my heart is very jocund
in the remembrance of so fair a dream
how far into the morning is it lords

upon the stroke of four

why then tis time to arm and give direction
his oration to his Soldiers
more than I have said loving countrymen
the leisure and enforcement of the time
forbids to dwell on yet remember this
God and our good cause fight upon our side
the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
Richard except those whom we fight against
had rather have us win than him they follow
for what is he they follow truly gentlemen
a bloody tyrant and a homicide
one rais'd in blood and one in blood establish'd
one that made means to come by what he hath
and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him
a base foul stone made precious by the foil
of England's chair where he is falsely set
one that hath ever been God's enemy
then if you fight against God's enemy
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers
if you do sweat to put a tyrant down
you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
if you do fight against your country's foes
your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire
if you do fight in safeguard of your wives
your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
if you do free your children from the sword
then in the name of God and all these rights
advance your standards draw your willing swords
for me the ransom of my bold attempt
shall be this cold corse on the earth's cold face
but if I thrive the gain of my attempt
the least of your shall share his part thereof
sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully
God and Saint George Richmond and victory

what said Northumberland as touching Richmond

that he was never trained up in arms

he said the truth and what said Surrey then

he smil'd and said The better for our purpose

he was i' the right and so indeed it is

who saw the sun to-day

not I my lord

then he disdains to shine for by the book
he should have brav'd the east an hour ago
a black day will it be to somebody
Ratcliff

my lord

the sun will not be seen to-day
the sky doth frown and lower upon our army
I would these dewy tears were from the ground
not shine to-day Why what is that to me
more than to Richmond for the self-same heaven
that frowns on me looks sadly upon him



come bustle bustle caparison my horse
call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
and thus my battle shall be ordered
my foreward shall be drawn out all in length
consisting equally of horse and foot
our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey
shall have the leading of this foot and horse
they thus directed we will follow
in the main battle whose puissance on either side
shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
this and Saint George to boot What think'st thou Norfolk

a good direction war-like sovereign
this found I on my tent this morning


for Dickon thy master is bought and sold
a thing devised by the enemy
go gentlemen every man to his charge
let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
conscience is but a word that cowards use
devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe
our strong arms be our conscience swords our law
march on join bravely let us to t pell-mell
if not to heaven then hand in hand to hell
his oration to his Army
what shall I say more than I have inferr'd
remember whom you are to cope withal
a sort of vagabonds rascals and run-aways
a scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants
whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
to desperate adventures and assur'd destruction
you sleeping safe they bring you to unrest
you having lands and bless'd with beauteous wives
they would restrain the one distain the other
long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost
a milksop one that never in his life
felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
let's whip these stragglers o'er the sea again
lash hence these overweening rags of France
these famish'd beggars weary of their lives
who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
for want of means poor rats had hang'd themselves
if we be conquer'd let men conquer us
and not these bastard Bretons whom our fathers
have in their own land beaten bobb'd and thump'd
and on record left them the heirs of shame
shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives
ravish our daughters

hark I hear their drum
fight gentlemen of England fight bold yeomen
draw archers draw your arrows to the head
spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood

what says Lord Stanley will he bring his power

my lord he doth deny to come

off with his son George's head

my lord the enemy is pass'd the marsh
after the battle let George Stanley die

a thousand hearts are great within my bosom
advance our standards set upon our foes
our ancient word of courage fair Saint George
inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
upon them Victory sits upon our helms


rescue my Lord of Norfolk rescue rescue
the king enacts more wonders than a man
his horse is slain and all on foot he fights
seeking for Richmond in the throat of death
rescue fair lord or else the day is lost


a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse

withdraw my lord I'll help you to a horse

slave I have set my life upon a cast
and I will stand the hazard of the die
I think there be six Richmonds in the field
five have I slain to-day instead of him
a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse

God and your arms be prais'd victorious friends
the day is ours the bloody dog is dead

courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee
from the dead temples of this bloody wretch
have I pluck'd off to grace thy brows withal
wear it enjoy it and make much of it

great God of heaven say amen to all
but tell me is young George Stanley living

he is my lord and safe in Leicester town
whither if you please we may withdraw us

what men of name are slain on either side

John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers
sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon

inter their bodies as becomes their births
proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fied
that in submission will return to us
and then as we have ta'en the sacrament
smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
that long hath frown'd upon their enmity
what traitor hears me and says not amen
England hath long been mad and scarr'd herself
the brother blindly shed the brother's blood
the father rashly slaughter'd his own son
the son compell'd been butcher to the sire
all this divided York and Lancaster
divided in their dire division
O now let Richmond and Elizabeth
the true succeeders of each royal house
by God's fair ordinance conjoin together
and let their heirs God if thy will be so
enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace
with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord
that would reduce these bloody days again
and make poor England weep in streams of blood
let them not live to taste this land's increase
now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again
that she may long live here God say amen

ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA

nay but this dotage of our general's
o'erflows the measure those his goodly eyes
that o'er the files and musters of the war
have glow'd like plated Mars now bend now turn
the office and devotion of their view
upon a tawny front his captain's heart
which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
the buckles on his breast reneges all temper
and is become the bellows and the fan
to cool a gipsy's lust Look where they come


take but good note and you shall see in him
the triple pillar of the world transform'd
into a strumpet's fool behold and see

if it be love indeed tell me how much

there's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd

I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd

then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth


news my good lord from Rome

grates me the sum

nay hear them Antony
Fulvia perchance is angry or who knows
if the scarce-bearded C sar have not sent
his powerful mandate to you Do this or this
perform t or else we damn thee

how my love

perchance nay and most like
you must not stay here longer your dismission
is come from C sar therefore hear it Antony
where's Fulvia's process C sar's I would say both
call in the messengers As I am Egypt's queen
thou blushest Antony and that blood of thine
is C sar's homager else so thy cheek pays shame
when shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds The messengers

let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch
of the rang'd empire fall Here is my space
kingdoms are clay our dungy earth alike
feeds beast as man the nobleness of life
is to do thus when such a mutual pair

on pain of punishment the world to weet
we stand up peerless

excellent falsehood
why did he marry Fulvia and not love her
I'll seem the fool I am not Antony
will be himself

but stirr'd by Cleopatra
now for the love of Love and her soft hours
let's not confound the time with conference harsh
there's not a minute of our lives should stretch
without some pleasure now What sport to-night

hear the ambassadors

fie wrangling queen
whom every thing becomes to chide to laugh
to weep whose every passion fully strives
no messenger but thine and all alone
to-night we'll wander through the streets and note
the qualities of people Come my queen
last night you did desire it speak not to us


is C sar with Antonius priz'd so slight

sir sometimes when he is not Antony
he comes too short of that great property
which still should go with Antony

I am full sorry
that he approves the common liar who
thus speaks of him at Rome but I will hope
of better deeds to-morrow Rest you happy


lord Alexas sweet Alexas most any thing Alexas almost most absolute Alexas where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen O that I knew this husband which you say must charge his horns with garlands
soothsayer

your will

is this the man Is't you sir that know things

in nature's infinite book of secrecy
a little I can read

show him your hand


bring in the banquet quickly wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink

good sir give me good fortune

I make not but foresee


you shall be yet far fairer than you are

he means in flesh

no you shall paint when you are old

wrinkles forbid

vex not his prescience be attentive

hush

you shall be more beloving than belov'd

I had rather heat my liver with drinking

nay hear him


you shall outlive the lady whom you serve

O excellent I love long life better than figs

you have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
than that which is to approach

then belike my children shall have no names prithee how many boys and wenches must I have

if every of your wishes had a womb
and fertile every wish a million

out fool I forgive thee for a witch

you think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes

nay come tell Iras hers


mine and most of our fortunes to-night shall be drunk to bed

there's a palm presages chastity if nothing else

e'en as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine

go you wild bedfellow you cannot soothsay

nay if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication I cannot scratch mine ear
prithee tell her but a worky-day fortune

your fortunes are alike

but how but how give me particulars

I have said

am I not an inch of fortune better than she
well if you were but an inch of fortune better than I where would you choose it

not in my husband's nose

our worser thoughts heaven mend Alexas come his fortune his fortune O let him marry a woman that cannot go sweet Isis I beseech thee and let her die too and give him a worse and let worse follow worse till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave fifty-fold a cuckold Good Isis hear me this prayer though thou deny me a matter of more weight good Isis I beseech thee

amen Dear goddess hear that prayer of the people for as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wived so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded therefore dear Isis keep decorum and fortune him accordingly

amen

lo now if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold they would make themselves whores but they'd do't

hush here comes Antony

not he the queen


saw you my lord


was he not here

no madam

he was dispos'd to mirth but on the sudden
a Roman thought hath struck him Enobarbus

madam

seek him and bring him hither Where's Alexas

here at your service My lord approaches


we will not look upon him go with us


Fulvia thy wife first came into the field
against my brother Lucius

ay
but soon that war had end and the time's state
made friends of them jointing their force gainst C sar
whose better issue in the war from Italy
upon the first encounter drave them

well what worst

the nature of bad news infects the teller

when it concerns the fool or coward On
things that are past are done with me Tis thus
who tells me true though in his tale lay death
I hear him as he flatter'd

labienus
this is stiff news hath with his Parthian force
his conquering banner shook from Syria
to Lydia and to Ionia whilst

Antony thou wouldst say

O my lord

speak to me home mince not the general tongue
name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome
rail thou in Fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults
with such full licence as both truth and malice
have power to utter O then we bring forth weeds
when our quick winds lie still and our ills told us
is as our earing Fare thee well awhile

at your noble pleasure


from Sicyon ho the news Speak there
the man from Sicyon is there such an one

he stays upon your will

let him appear
these strong Egyptian fetters I must break
or lose myself in dotage

what are you

Fulvia thy wife is dead

where died she

in Sicyon
her length of sickness with what else more serious
importeth thee to know this bears



there's a great spirit gone Thus did I desire it
what our contempts do often hurl from us
we wish it ours again the present pleasure
by revolution lowering does become
the opposite of itself she's good being gone
the hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on
I must from this enchanting queen break off
ten thousand harms more than the ills I know
my idleness doth hatch How now Enobarbus


what's your pleasure sir

I must with haste from hence

why then we kill all our women We see how mortal an unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure death's the word

I must be gone
under a compelling occasion let women die it were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing Cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying

she is cunning past man's thought

alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report this cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove

would I had never seen her

O sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel

Fulvia is dead

sir

Fulvia is dead

Fulvia

dead
why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new If there were no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow

the business she hath broached in the state
cannot endure my absence

and the business you have broached here cannot be without you especially that of Cleopatra's which wholly depends on your abode

no more light answers Let our officers Have notice what we purpose I shall break
the cause of our expedience to the queen
and get her leave to part For not alone
the death of Fulvia with more urgent touches
do strongly speak to us but the letters too
of many our contriving friends in Rome
petition us at home Sextus Pompeius
hath given the dare to C sar and commands
the empire of the sea our slippery people
whose love is never link'd to the deserver
till his deserts are past begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
higher than both in blood and life stands up
for the main soldier whose quality going on
the sides o' the world may danger Much is breeding
which like the courser's hair hath yet but life
and not a serpent's poison Say our pleasure
to such whose place is under us requires
our quick remove from hence

I shall do it


where is he

I did not see him since

see where he is who's with him what he does
I did not send you if you find him sad
say I am dancing if in mirth report
that I am sudden sick quick and return

madam methinks if you did love him dearly
you do not hold the method to enforce
the like from him

what should I do I do not

in each thing give him way cross him in nothing

thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him

tempt him not so too far I wish forbear
in time we hate that which we often fear
but here comes Antony


I am sick and sullen

I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
help me away dear Charmian I shall fall
it cannot be thus long the sides of nature
will not sustain it

now my dearest queen

pray you stand further from me

what's the matter

I know by that same eye there's some good news
what says the married woman You may go
would she had never given you leave to come
let her not say tis I that keep you here
I have no power upon you hers you are

the gods best know

O never was there queen
I saw the treasons planted

Cleopatra

why should I think you can be mine and true
though you in swearing shake the throned gods
who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness
to be entangled with those mouth-made vows
which break themselves in swearing

most sweet queen

nay pray you seek no colour for your going
but bid farewell and go when you su'd staying
then was the time for words no going then
eternity was in our lips and eyes
bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor
but was a race of heaven they are so still
or thou the greatest soldier of the world

how now lady

I would I had thy inches thou shouldst know
there were a heart in Egypt

hear me queen
the strong necessity of time commands
our services awhile but my full heart
remains in use with you Our Italy
shines o'er with civil swords Sextus Pompeius
makes his approaches to the port of Rome
equality of two domestic powers
breeds scrupulous faction The hated grown to strength
are newly grown to love the condemn'd Pompey
rich in his father's honour creeps apace
into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
upon the present state whose numbers threaten
and quietness grown aick of rest would purge
and that which most with you should safe my going
is Fulvia's death

though age from folly could not give me freedom
it does from childishness can Fulvia die

she's dead my queen
look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
the garboils she awak'd at the last best
see when and where she died

O most false love
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
with sorrowful water Now I see I see
in Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be

quarrel no more but be prepar'd to know
the purposes I bear which are or cease
as you shall give the advice By the fire
thy soldier servant making peace or war
as thou affect'st

cut my lace Charmian come
but let it be I am quickly ill and well
so Antony loves

my precious queen forbear
and give true evidence to his love which stands
an honourable trial

so Fulvia told me
I prithee turn aside and weep for her
then bid adieu to me and say the tears
belong to Egypt good now play one scene
of excellent dissembling and let it look
like perfect honour

you'll heat my blood no more
you can do better yet but this is meetly

now by my sword

and target Still he mends
but this is not the best Look prithee Charmian
how this Herculean Roman does become
the carriage of his chafe

I'll leave you lady

courteous lord one word
sir you and I must part but that s not it
sir you and I have lov'd but there s not it
that you know well something it is I would
O my oblivion is a very Antony
and I am all forgotten

but that your royalty
for idleness itself

'Tis sweating labour
to bear such idleness so near the heart
as Cleopatra this But sir forgive me
since my becomings kill me when they do not
eye well to you your honour calls you hence
therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
and all the gods go with you Upon your sword
sit laurel victory and smooth success
be strew'd before your feet

let us go Come
our separation so abides and flies
that thou residing here go'st yet with me
and I hence fleeting here remain with thee
away


it is not C sar's natural vice to hate
our great competitor From Alexandria
this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike
than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy
more womanly than he hardly gave audience or
vouchsaf'd to think he had partners you shall find there
a man who is the abstract of all faults
that all men follow

I must not think there are
evils enow to darken all his goodness
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
more fiery by night's blackness hereditary
rather than purchas'd what he cannot change
than what he chooses

you are too indulgent Let us grant it is not
amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy
and keep the turn of tippling with a slave
to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him
as his composure must be rare indeed
whom these things cannot blemish yet must Antony
no way excuse his soils when we do bear
so great weight in his lightness If he fill'd
his vacancy with his voluptuousness
full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
call on him for t but to confound such time
that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
as his own state and ours tis to be chid
as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
pawn their experience to their present pleasure
and so rebel to judgment


here's more news

most noble C sar shalt thou have report
how tis abroad Pompey is strong at sea
and it appears he is belov'd of those
that only have fear'd C sar to the ports
the discontents repair and men's reports
give him much wrong'd

I should have known no less
it hath been taught us from the primal state
that he which is was wish'd until he were
and the ebb'd man ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love
comes dear'd by being lack'd This common body
like to a vagabond flag upon the stream
goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
to rot itself with motion

C sar I bring thee word
menecrates and Menas famous pirates
make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
they make in Italy the borders maritime
lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt
no vessel can peep forth but tis as soon
taken as seen for Pompey's name strikes more
than could his war resisted

Antony
leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once
wast beaten from Modena where thou slew'st
hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel
did famine follow whom thou fought'st against
though daintily brought up with patience more
than savages could suffer thou didst drink
the stale of horses and the gilded puddle
which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign
the roughest berry on the rudest hedge
yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
the barks of trees thou browsed'st on the Alps
it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
it wounds thy honour that I speak it now
was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
so much as lank'd not

'Tis pity of him

let his shames quickly
drive him to Rome Tis time we twain
did show ourselves i' the field and to that end
assemble me immediate council Pompey
thrives in our idleness

to-morrow C sar
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
both what by sea and land I can be able
to front this present time

till which encounter
it is my business too Farewell
farewell my lord What you shall know meantime
of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir
to let me be partaker

doubt not sir
I knew it for my bond


Charmian

madam

ha ha
give me to drink mandragora

why madam

that I might sleep out this great gap of time
my Antony is away
you think of him too much

O tis treason

madam I trust not so

thou eunuch Mardian

what s your highness' pleasure

not now to hear thee sing I take no pleasure
in aught a eunuch has Tis well for thee
that being unseminar'd thy freer thoughts
may not fly forth of Egypt Hast thou affections

yes gracious madam

indeed

but what in deed is honest to be done
yet have I fierce affections and think
what Venus did with Mars

O Charmian
where think'st thou he is now Stands he or sits he
or does he walk or is he on his horse
O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony
do bravely horse for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st
the demi-Atlas of this earth the arm
and burgonet of men He's speaking now
or murmuring Where's my serpent of old Nile
for so he calls me Now I feed myself
with most delicious poison Think on me
that am with Ph bus' amorous pinches black
and wrinkled deep in time Broad-fronted C sar
when thou wast here above the ground I was
a morsel for a monarch and great Pompey
would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
with looking on his life


sovereign of Egypt hail

how much unlike art thou Mark Antony
yet coming from him that great medicine hath
with his tinct gilded thee
how goes it with my brave Mark Antony

last thing he did dear queen
he kiss'd the last of many doubled kisses
this orient pearl His speech sticks in my heart

mine ear must pluck it thence

'Good friend quoth he
'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
this treasure of an oyster at whose foot
her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east
say thou shall call her mistress So he nodded
and soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed
who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
was beastly dumb'd by him

what was he sad or merry

like to the time o' the year between the extremes
of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry

O well-divided disposition Note him
note him good Charmian tis the man but note him
he was not sad for he would shire on those
that make their looks by his he was not merry
which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
in Egypt with his joy but between both
O heavenly mingle Be'st thou sad or merry
the violence of either thee becomes

ay madam twenty several messengers
why do you send so thick

who's born that day
when I forget to send to Antony
shall die a beggar Ink and paper Charmian
welcome my good Alexas Did I Charmian
ever love C sar so

O that brave C sar

be chok'd with such another emphasis
say the brave Antony

the valiant C sar

by Isis I will give thee bloody teeth
if thou with C sar paragon again

by your most gracious pardon
I sing but after you

my salad days
when I was green in judgment cold in blood
to say as I said then But come away
get me ink and paper
he shall have every day a several greeting
or I'll unpeople Egypt

if the great gods be just they shall assist
the deeds of justest men

know worthy Pompey
that what they do delay they not deny

whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
the thing we sue for
we ignorant of ourselves
beg often our own harms which the wise powers
deny us for our good so find we profit
by losing of our prayers

I shall do well
the people love me and the sea is mine
my powers are crescent and my auguring hope
says it will come to the full Mark Antony
in Egypt sits at dinner and will make
no wars without doors C sar gets money where
he loses hearts Lepidus flatters both
of both is flatter'd but he neither loves
nor either cares for him

C sar and Lepidus
are in the field a mighty strength they carry

where have you this tis false
from Silvius sir

he dreams I know they are in Rome together
looking for Antony But all the charms of love
salt Cleopatra soften thy wan'd lip
let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks
sharpen with cloyless sance his appetite
that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
even till a Lethe'd dulness

how now Varrius

this is most certain that I shall deliver
mark Antony is every hour in Rome
expected since he went from Egypt tis
a space for further travel

a better ear Menas I did not think
this amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
for such a petty war his soldiership
is twice the other twain But let us rear
the higher our opinion that our stirring
can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
the ne'er-lust-wearied Antony

I cannot hope
C sar and Antony shall well greet together
his wife that's dead did trespasses to C sar
his brother warr'd upon him although I think
not mov'd by Antony

I know not Menas
how lesser enmities may give way to greater
were t not that we stand up against them all
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves
for they have entertained cause enough
may cement their divisions and bind up
the petty difference we yet not know
be it as our gods will have t It only stands
our lives upon to use our strongest hands
come Menas


good Enobarbus tis a worthy deed
and shall become you well to entreat your captain
to soft and gentle speech

I shall entreat him
to answer like himself if C sar move him
let Antony look over C sar's head
and speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter
were I the wearer of Antonius' beard
I would not shave t to-day

'Tis not a time

every time
serves for the matter that is then born in t

but small to greater matters must give way

not if the small come first

your speech is passion
but pray you stir no embers up Here comes
the noble Antony


and yonder C sar


if we compose well here to Parthia
hark ye Ventidius

Mec nas ask Agrippa

noble friends
that which combin'd us was most great and let not
a leaner action rend us What's amiss
may it be gently heard when we debate
our trivial difference loud we do commit
murder in healing wounds then noble partners
the rather for I earnestly beseech
touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
nor curstness grow to the matter

'Tis spoken well
were we before our armies and to fight
I should do thus

welcome to Rome

thank you
sit

sit sir

nay then

I learn you take things ill which are not so
or being concern you not

I must be laugh'd at
if or for nothing or a little I
should say myself offended and with you
chiefly i' the world more laugh'd at that I should
once name you derogately when to sound your name
it not concern'd me

my being in Egypt C sar
what was t to you

might be to you in Egypt yet if you there
did practise on my state your being in Egypt
might be my question

how intend you practis'd

you may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
by what did here befall me Your wife and brother
made wars upon me and their contestation
was theme for you you were the word of war

you do mistake your business my brother never
did urge me in his act I did inquire it
and have my learning from some true reports
that drew their swords with you Did he not rather
discredit my authority with yours
and make the wars alike against my stomach
having alike your cause Of this my letters
before did satisfy you If you'll patch a quarrel
it must not be with this

you praise yourself
by laying defects of judgment to me but
you patch'd up your excuses

not so not so
I know you could not lack I am certain on t
very necessity of this thought that I
your partner in the cause gainst which he fought
could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
which fronted mine own peace As for my wife
I would you had her spirit in such another
the third o' the world is yours which with a snaffle
you may pace easy but not such a wife

would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women

so much uncurbable her garboils C sar
shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant
did you too much disquiet for that you must
but say I could not help it

I wrote to you
when rioting in Alexandria you
did pocket up my letters and with taunts
did gibe my missive out of audience

sir
he fell upon me ere admitted then
three kings I had newly feasted and did want
of what I was i' the morning but next day
I told him of myself which was as much
as to have ask'd him pardon Let this fellow
be nothing of our strife if we contend
out of our question wipe him

you have broken
have tongue to charge me with

soft C sar

no
Lepidus let him speak
the honour's sacred which he talks on now
supposing that I lack'd it But on C sar
the article of my oath

to lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them
the which you both denied

neglected rather
and then when poison'd hours had bound me up
from mine own knowledge As nearly as I may
I'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty
shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
work without it Truth is that Fulvia
for which myself the ignorant motive do
so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
to stoop in such a case

'Tis noble spoken

if it might please you to enforce no further
the griefs between ye to forget them quite
were to remember that the present need
speaks to atone you

worthily spoken Mec nas

or if you borrow one another's love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do

thou art a soldier only speak no more

that truth should be silent I had almost forgot


go to then your considerate stone

I do not much dislike the matter but
the manner of his speech for it cannot be
we shall remain in friendship our conditions
so differing in their acts Yet if I knew
what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
o' the world I would pursue it

give me leave C sar

speak Agrippa

thou hast a sister by the mother's side
admir'd Octavia great Mark Antony
is now a widower

say not so Agrippa
were well deserv'd of rashness

I am not married C sar let me hear
Agrippa further speak

to hold you in perpetual amity
to make you brothers and to knit your hearts
with an unslipping knot take Antony
Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
no worse a husband than the best of men
whose virtue and whose general graces speak
that which none else can utter By this marriage
all little jealousies which now seem great
and all great fears which now import their dangers
would then be nothing truths would be but tales
where now half tales be truths her love to both
would each to other and all loves to both
draw after her Pardon what I have spoke
for tis a studied not a present thought

will C sar speak

not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
with what is spoke already

what power is in Agrippa
if I would say Agrippa be it so
to make this good

the power of C sar and
his power unto Octavia

may I never
to this good purpose that so fairly shows
dream of impediment Let me have thy hand
further this act of grace and from this hour
the heart of brothers govern in our loves
and sway our great designs
there is my hand
a sister I bequeath you whom no brother
did ever love so dearly let her live
to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
fly off our loves again

happily amen

I did not think to draw my sword gainst Pompey
for he hath laid strange courtesies and great
of late upon me I must thank him only
lest my remembrance suffer ill report
at heel of that defy him

time calls upon s
of us must Pompey presently be sought
or else he seeks out us

where lies he
about the Mount Misenum

what's his strength
by land

great and increasing but by sea
he is an absolute master

so is the fame
would we had spoke together Haste we for it
yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
the business we have talk'd of

with most gladness
and do invite you to my sister's view
whither straight I'll lead you

let us Lepidus
not lack your company
noble Antony
not sickness should detain me


welcome from Egypt sir

half the heart of C sar worthy Mec nas My honourable friend Agrippa

good Enobarbus

we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested You stayed well by t in
Egypt

ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking

eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there is this true

this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting


when she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus

there she appeared indeed or my reporter devised well for her

I will tell you
the barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne
burn'd on the water the poop was beaten gold
purple the sails and so perfumed that
the winds were love-sick with them the oars were silver
which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
the water which they beat to follow faster
as amorous of their strokes For her own person
it beggar'd all description she did lie
in her pavilion cloth-of-gold of tissue
o'er-picturing that Venus where we see
the fancy outwork nature on each side her
stood pretty-dimpled boys like smiling Cupids
with divers-colour'd fans whose wind did seem
and what they undid did

O rare for Antony

her gentlewomen like the Nereides
so many mermaids tended her i' the eyes
and made their bends adornings at the helm
a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
that yarely frame the office From the barge
a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
of the adjacent wharfs The city cast
her people out upon her and Antony
enthron'd i' the market-place did sit alone
whistling to the air which but for vacancy
had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
and made a gap in nature

rare Egyptian
upon her landing Antony sent to her
invited her to supper she replied
it should be better he became her guest
which she entreated Our courteous Antony
whom ne'er the word of No' woman heard speak
being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast
and for his ordinary pays his heart
for what his eyes eat only

royal wench
she made great C sar lay his sword to bed
he plough'd her and she cropp'd

I saw her once
hop forty paces through the public street
and having lost her breath she spoke and panted
that she did make defect perfection
and breathless power breathe forth


never he will not
age cannot wither her nor custom stale
her infinite variety other women cloy
the appetites they feed but she makes hungry
where most she satisfies for vilest things
become themselves in her that the holy priests
bless her when she is riggish

if beauty wisdom modesty can settle
the heart of Antony Octavia is
a blessed lottery to him

let us go
good Enobarbus make yourself my guest
whilst you abide here

humbly sir I thank you

the world and my great office will sometimes
divide me from your bosom

all which time
before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
to them for you

good night sir My Octavia
read not my blemishes in the world's report
I have not kept my square but that to come
shall all be done by the rule Good night dear lady

good night sir

good night

now sirrah you do wish yourself in Egypt

would I had never come from thence nor you

if you can your reason

I see it in
my motion have it not in my tongue but yet
hie you to Egypt again

say to me
whose fortunes shall rise higher C sar's or mine

C sar's
therefore O Antony stay not by his side
thy demon that's thy spirit which keeps thee is
noble courageous high unmatchable
where C sar's is not but near him thy angel
becomes a fear as being o'erpower'd therefore
make space enough between you

speak this no more
to none but thee no more but when to thee
if thou dost play with him at any game
thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck
he beats thee gainst the odds thy lustre thickens
when he shines by I say again thy spirit
is all afraid to govern thee near him
but he away tis noble

get thee gone
say to Ventidius I would speak with him

he shall to Parthia Be it art or hap
he hath spoken true the very dice obey him
and in our sports my better cunning faints
under his chance if we draw lots he speeds
his cocks do win the battle still of mine
when it is all to nought and his quails ever
beat mine inhoop'd at odds I will to Egypt
and though I make this marriage for my peace


O come Ventidius
you must to Parthia your commission's ready
follow me and receive t

trouble yourselves no further pray you hasten
your generals after

sir Mark Antony
will e'en but kiss Octavia and we'll follow

till I shall see you in your soldier's dress
which will become you both farewell

we shall
as I conceive the journey be at the Mount
before you Lepidus

my purposes to draw me much about
you ll win two days upon me

sir good success

sir good success

farewell


give me some music music moody food
of us that trade in love

the music ho


let it alone let s to billiards come Charmian

my arm is sore best play with Mardian
as well a woman with a eunuch play'd
as with a woman Come you ll play with me sir

as well as I can madam

and when good will is show'd though't come too short
the actor may plead pardon I ll none now
give me mine angle we'll to the river there
my music playing far off I will betray
tawny-finn'd fishes my bended hook shall pierce
their slimy jaws and as I draw them up
I'll think them every one an Antony
and say Ah ha you're caught

'Twas merry when
you wager'd on your angling when your diver
did hang a salt-fish on his hook which he
with fervency drew up

I laugh'd him out of patience and that night
I laugh'd him into patience and next morn
ere the ninth hour I drunk him to his bed
then put my tires and mantles on him whilst
I wore his sword Philippan


O from Italy
ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears

that long time have been barren

madam madam

Antony's dead if thou say so villain
thou kill'st thy mistress but well and free
if thou so yield him there is gold and here
my bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings
have lipp'd and trembled kissing
first madam he is well

why there's more gold
but sirrah mark we use
to say the dead are well bring it to that
the gold I give thee will I melt and pour
down thy ill-uttering throat

good madam hear me

well go to I will
but there's no goodness in thy face if Antony
be free and healthful so tart a favour
to trumpet such good tidings if not well
thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes
not like a formal man

will't please you hear me

yet if thou say Antony lives is well
or friends with C sar or not captive to him
I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail
rich pearls upon thee

madam he's well

well said

and friends with C sar

thou'rt an honest man

C sar and he are greater friends than ever

make thee a fortune from me

but yet madam

the good precedence fie upon but yet
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
some monstrous malefactor Prithee friend
pour out the pack of matter to mine ear
the good and bad together He's friends with C sar
in state of health thou sayst and thou sayst free

free madam no I made no such report
he's bound unto Octavia

for what good turn

for the best turn i' the bed

I am pale Charmian

madam he's married to Octavia

the most infectious pestilence upon thee

good madam patience

what say you Hence

horrible villain or I'll spurn thine eyes
like balls before me I'll unhair thy head

thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine
smarting in lingering pickle

gracious madam
I that do bring the news made not the match

say tis not so a province I will give thee
and make thy fortunes proud the blow thou hadst
shall make thy peace for moving me to rage
and I will boot thee with what gift beside
thy modesty can beg
he's married madam

rogue thou hast liv'd too long


nay then I'll run
what mean you madam I have made no fault


good madam keep yourself within yourself
the man is innocent

some innocents scape not the thunderbolt
melt Egypt into Nile and kindly creatures
turn all to serpents Call the slave again
though I am mad I will not bite him Call

he is afeard to come


these hands do lack nobility that they strike
a meaner than myself since I myself
have given myself the cause


come hither sir
though it be honest it is never good
to bring bad news give to a gracious message
a host of tongues but let ill tidings tell

themselves when they be felt

I have done my duty

is he married
I cannot hate thee worser than I do
if thou again say Yes


the gods confound thee dost thou hold there still

should I lie madam

O I would thou didst
so half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
a cistern for scal'd snakes Go get thee hence
hadst thou Narcissus in thy face to me
thou wouldst appear most ugly He is married

I crave your highness' pardon

he is married

take no offence that I would not offend you
to punish me for what you make me do
seems much unequal he's married to Octavia

that art not what thou'rt sure of Get thee hence
the merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
are all too dear for me lie they upon thy hand
and be undone by em


good your highness patience

in praising Antony I have disprais'd C sar

many times madam

I am paid for t now
lead me from hence
I faint O Iras Charmian Tis no matter
go to the fellow good Alexas bid him
report the feature of Octavia her years
her inclination let him not leave out
the colour of her hair bring me word quickly
let him forever go let him not Charmian
though he be painted one way like a Gorgon
the other way's a Mars

bid you Alexas
bring me word how tall she is Pity me Charmian
but do not speak to me Lead me to my chamber


your hostages I have so have you mine
and we shall talk before we fight

most meet
that first we come to words and therefore have we
our written purposes before us sent
which if thou hast consider'd let us know
if twill tie up thy discontented sword
and carry back to Sicily much tall youth
that else must perish here
to you all three
the senators alone of this great world
chief factors for the gods I do not know
wherefore my father should revengers want
having a son and friends since Julius C sar
who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted
there saw you labouring for him What was t
that mov'd pale Cassius to conspire and what
made the all-honour'd honest Roman Brutus
with the arm'd rest courtiers of beauteous freedom
to drench the Capitol but that they would
have one man but a man And that is it
hath made me rig my navy at whose burden
the anger'd ocean foams with which I meant
to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
cast on my noble father

take your time

we ll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st
how much we do o'er-count thee

at land indeed
thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house
but since the cuckoo builds not for himself
remain in t as thou mayst

be pleas'd to tell us
for this is from the present how you take
the offers we have sent you

there's the point

which do not be entreated to but weigh
what it is worth embrac'd

and what may follow
to try a larger fortune
you have made me offer
of Sicily Sardinia and I must
rid all the sea of pirates then to send
measures of wheat to Rome this greed upon
to part with unhack'd edges and bear back
our targets undinted

that's our offer

that's our offer

that's our offer

know then
I came before you here a man prepar'd
to take this offer but Mark Antony
put me to some impatience Though I lose
the praise of it by telling you must know
when C sar and your brother were at blows
her welcome friendly

I have heard it Pompey
and am well studied for a liberal thanks
which I do owe you

let me have your hand
I did not think sir to have met you here

the beds i' the east are soft and thanks to you
that call'd me timelier than my purpose hither
for I have gain'd by t

since I saw you last
there is a change upon you

well I know not
what counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face
but in my bosom shall she never come

well met here

I hope so Lepidus Thus we are agreed
I crave our composition may be written
and seal'd between us

that s the next to do

we'll feast each other ere we part and let's
draw lots who shall begin

that will I Pompey

no Antony take the lot
but first or last your fine Egyptian cookery
shall have the fame I have heard that Julius C sar
grew fat with feasting there


I have fair meanings sir

and fair words to them

then so much have I heard
and I have heard Apollodorus carried

no more of that he did so

what I pray you

a certain queen to C sar in a mattress

I know thee now how far'st thou soldier

well
and well am like to do for I perceive
four feasts are toward
let me shake thy hand
I never hated thee I have seen thee fight
when I have envied thy behaviour

sir
I never lov'd you much but I ha' prais'd ye
when you have well deserv'd ten times as much
as I have said you did

enjoy thy plainness
it nothing ill becomes thee
aboard my galley I invite you all
will you lead lords

show us the way sir

show us the way sir

show us the way sir
come


thy father Pompey would ne'er have made this treaty You and I have known sir

at sea I think

we have sir

you have done well by water

and you by land

I will praise any man that will praise me though it cannot be denied what I have done by land

nor what I have done by water

yes something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea


there I deny my land service But give me your hand Menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing

all men's faces are true whatsoe'er their hands are

but there is never a fair woman has a true face

no slander they steal hearts

we came hither to fight with you

for my part I am sorry it is turned to a drinking Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune

if he do sure he cannot weep it back again

you have said sir We looked not for Mark Antony here pray you is he married to Cleopatra

C sar's sister is called Octavia


but she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius

pray ye sir

'Tis true

then is C sar and he for ever knit together

if I were bound to divine of this unity I would not prophesy so

I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties

I think so too but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity Octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation

who would not have his wife so

not he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony He will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in C sar and as I said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance Antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here


I shall take it sir we have used our throats in Egypt

come let s away


here they'll be man Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already the least wind i' the world will blow them down

Lepidus is high-coloured

they have made him drink alms-drink

as they pinch one another by the disposition he cries out No more reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to the drink

but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion

why this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave

to be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen to move in't are the holes where eyes should be which pitifully disaster the cheeks
thus do they sir They take the flow o' the Nile
by certain scales i' the pyramid they know
by the height the lowness or the mean if dearth
or foison follow The higher Nilus swells
the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman
upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain
and shortly comes to harvest

you've strange serpents there

ay Lepidus

your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile

they are so

sit and some wine A health to Lepidus

I am not so well as I should be but I'll ne'er out
not till you have slept I fear me you'll be in till then

nay certainly I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things without contradiction I have heard that

Pompey a word

say in mine ear what is't

forsake thy seat I do beseech thee captain
and bear me speak a word

forbear me till anon
this wine for Lepidus

what manner o' thing is your crocodile

it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates

what colour is it of
of it own colour too

'Tis a strange serpent

'Tis so and the tears of it are wet

will this description satisfy him

with the health that Pompey gives him else he is a very epicure

go hang sir hang Tell me of that away
do as I bid you Where's this cup I call'd for

if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me
rise from thy stool

I think thou'rt mad The matter



thou hast serv'd me with much faith What s else to say
be jolly lords

these quick-sands Lepidus
keep off them for you sink

wilt thou be lord of all the world

what sayst thou

wilt thou be lord of the whole world That s twice

how should that be

but entertain it
and though thou think me poor I am the man
will give thee all the world


no Pompey I have kept me from the cup
thou art if thou dar'st be the earthly Jove
whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
is thine if thou wilt ha t

show me which way

these three world-sharers these competitors
are in thy vessel let me cut the cable
and when we are put off fall to their throats
all there is thine

Ah this thou shouldst have done
and not have spoke on t In me tis villany
in thee t had been good service Thou must know
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour
mine honour it Repent that e'er thy tongue
hath so betray'd thine act being done unknown
but must condemn it now Desist and drink

for this
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more
who seeks and will not take when once tis offer'd
shall never find it more

this health to Lepidus

bear him ashore I'll pledge it for him Pompey

here's to thee Menas

Enobarbus welcome

fill till the cup be hid

there's a strong fellow Menas

why

a' bears the third part of the world man see'st not

the third part then is drunk would it were all
that it might go on wheels

drink thou increase the reels

come

this is not yet an Alexandrian feast

it ripens towards it Strike the vessels ho
here is to C sar

I could well forbear't
it's monstrous labour when I wash my brain
and it grows fouler
be a child o' the time

possess it I'll make answer
but I had rather fast from all four days
than drink so much in one

ha my brave emperor
shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
and celebrate our drink

let s ha t good soldier

come let s all take hands
till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
in soft and delicate Lethe

all take hands
make battery to our ears with the loud music
the while I'll place you then the boy shall sing
as his strong sides can volley


come thou monarch of the vine
plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne
in thy fats our cares be drown'd
with thy grapes our hairs be crown'd
cup us till the world go round
cup us till the world go round

what would you more Pompey good night Good brother
let me request you off our graver business
frowns at this levity Gentle lords let's part
you see we have burnt our cheeks strong Enobarb
is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue
splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost
antick'd us all What needs more words Good night
good Antony your hand


and shall sir Give's your hand

O Antony
you have my father s house But what we are friends
come down into the boat

take heed you fall not

Menas I'll not on shore

no to my cabin
these drums these trumpets flutes what
let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
to these great fellows sound and be hang'd sound out


hoo says a' There's my cap



now darting Parthia art thou struck and now
pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
make me revenger Bear the king's son's body
before our army Thy Pacorus Orodes
pays this for Marcus Crassus

noble Ventidius
whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
the fugitive Parthians follow spur through Media
mesopotamia and the shelters whither
the routed fly so thy grand captain Antony
shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
put garlands on thy head

O Silius Silius
I have done enough a lower place note well
may make too great an act for learn this Silius
acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away
C sar and Antony have ever won
more in their officer than person Sossius
one of my place in Syria his lieutenant
for quick accumulation of renown
which he achiev'd by the minute lost his favour
who does i' the wars more than his captain can
becomes his captain's captain and ambition
the soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss
than gain which darkens him
I could do more to do Antonius good
but twould offend him and in his offence
should my performance perish

thou hast Ventidius that
without the which a soldier and his sword
grants scarce distinction Thou wilt write to Antony

I'll humbly signify what in his name
how with his banners and his well-paid ranks
the ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
we have jaded out o' the field

where is he now

he purposeth to Athens whither with what haste
the weight we must convey with s will permit
we shall appear before him On there pass along


what are the brothers parted

they have dispatch'd with Pompey he is gone
the other three are sealing Octavia weeps
to part from Rome C sar is sad and Lepidus
since Pompey's feast as Menas says is troubled
with the green sickness


a very fine one O how he loves C sar

nay but how dearly he adores Mark Antony

C sar Why he's the Jupiter of men

what's Antony The god of Jupiter

spake you of C sar How the non-pareil

O Antony O thou Arabian bird

would you praise C sar say C sar go no further

indeed he plied them both with excellent praises

but he loves C sar best yet he loves Antony
hoo hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets cannot
his love to Antony But as for C sar
kneel down kneel down and wonder

both he loves

they are his shards and he their beetle


so
this is to horse Adieu noble Agrippa

good fortune worthy soldier and farewell


no further sir

you take from me a great part of myself
use me well in't Sister prove such a wife
as my thoughts make thee and as my furthest band
let not the piece of virtue which is set
betwixt us as the cement of our love
to keep it builded be the ram to batter
the fortress of it for better might we
have lov'd without this mean if on both parts
this be not cherish'd

make me not offended
in your distrust

I have said

you shall not find
though you be therein curious the least cause
for what you seem to fear So the gods keep you
and make the hearts of Romans serve your ends
we will here part

farewell my dearest sister fare thee well
thy spirits all of comfort fare thee well

my noble brother

the April's in her eyes it is love's spring
and these the showers to bring it on Be cheerful

sir look well to my husband's house and

what
Octavia

I'll tell you in your ear

her tongue will not obey her heart nor can
her heart obey her tongue the swan's downfeather
that stands upon the swell at full of tide
and neither way inclines


he has a cloud in's face

he were the worse for that were he a horse
so is he being a man

why Enobarbus
when Antony found Julius C sar dead
he cried almost to roaring and he wept
when at Philippi he found Brutus slain

that year indeed he was troubled with a rheum
what willingly he did confound he wail'd
believe t till I wept too

no sweet Octavia
you shall hear from me still the time shall not
out-go my thinking on you

I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love
look here I have you thus I let you go
and give you to the gods

adieu be happy

let all the number of the stars give light
to thy fair way

farewell farewell


farewell


where is the fellow

half afeard to come


come hither sir

good majesty
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
but when you are well pleas'd

that Herod's head
I'll have but how when Antony is gone
through whom I might command it Come thou near

most gracious majesty

didst thou behold
Octavia

ay dread queen

where
madam in Rome
I look'd her in the face and saw her led
between her brother and Mark Antony

is she as tall as me

she is not madam

didst hear her speak is she shrill-tongu'd or low

madam I heard her speak she is low-voic'd

that's not so good He cannot like her long

like her O Isis tis impossible

I think so Charmian dull of tongue and dwarfish
what majesty is in her gait Remember
if e'er thou look'dst on majesty
she creeps
her motion and her station are as one
she shows a body rather than a life
a statue than a breather

is this certain

or I have no observance

three in Egypt
cannot make better note

he's very knowing
I do perceive t There's nothing in her yet
the fellow has good judgment

excellent

guess at her years I prithee
madam
she was a widow

widow Charmian hark

and I do think she's thirty

bear'st thou her face in mind is't long or round

round even to faultiness

for the most part too they are foolish that are so
her hair what colour

brown madam and her forehead
as low as she would wish it

there's gold for thee
thou must not take my former sharpness ill
most fit for business Go make thee ready
our letters are prepar'd


a proper man

indeed he is so I repent me much
that so I harried him Why methinks by him
this creature's no such thing

nothing madam

the man hath seen some majesty and should know

hath he seen majesty Isis else defend
and serving you so long

I have one thing more to ask him yet good Charmian
but tis no matter thou shalt bring him to me

I warrant you madam


nay nay Octavia not only that
that were excusable that and thousands more
of semblable import but he hath wag'd
new wars gainst Pompey made his will and read it
to public ear
spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not
but pay me terms of honour cold and sickly
he vented them most narrow measure lent me
when the best hint was given him he not took t
or did it from his teeth

O my good lord
believe not all or if you must believe
stomach not all A more unhappy lady
if this division chance ne'er stood between
the good gods will mock me presently
when I shall pray O bless my lord and husband
undo that prayer by crying out as loud
'O bless my brother Husband win win brother
prays and destroys the prayer no midway
'Twixt these extremes at all

gentle Octavia
let your best love draw to that point which seeks
best to preserve it If I lose mine honour
I lose myself better I were not yours
than yours so branchless But as you requested
yourself shall go between's the mean time lady
I'll raise the preparation of a war
shall stain your brother make your soonest haste
so your desires are yours

thanks to my lord
the Jove of power make me most weak most weak
as if the world should cleave and that slain men
should solder up the rift

when it appears to you where this begins
turn your displeasure that way for our faults
can never be so equal that your love
can equally move with them Provide your going
choose your own company and command what cost
your heart has mind to


how now friend Eros

there's strange news come sir

what man

C sar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey


C sar having made use of him in the wars gainst Pompey presently denied him rivality would not let him partake in the glory of the action and not resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey upon his own appeal seizes him so the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine

then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more
and throw between them all the food thou hast
they'll grind the one the other Where's Antony

he's walking in the garden thus and spurns
the rush that lies before him cries Fool Lepidus
and threats the throat of that his officer
that murder'd Pompey

our great navy's rigg'd

for Italy and C sar More Domitius
my lord desires you presently my news
I might have told hereafter

'Twill be naught

come sir


contemning Rome he has done all this and more
in Alexandria here's the manner of t
i' the market-place on a tribunal silver'd
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
were publicly enthron'd at the feet sat
C sarion whom they call my father's son
and all the unlawful issue that their lust
since then hath made between them Unto her
he gave the stablishment of Egypt made her
of Lower Syria Cyprus Lydia
absolute queen

this in the public eye

i' the common show-place where they exercise
great Media Parthia and Armenia
he gave to Alexander to Ptolemy he assign'd
Syria Cilicia and Ph nicia She
in the habiliments of the goddess Isis
that day appear'd and oft before gave audience
as tis reported so

let Rome be thus
informed

who queasy with his insolence
already will their good thoughts call from him

the people know it and have now receiv'd
his accusations

whom does he accuse

C sar and that having in Sicily
his part o' the isle then does he say he lent me
some shipping unrestor'd lastly he frets
that Lepidus of the triumvirate
should be depos'd and being that we detain
all his revenue

sir this should be answer'd

'Tis done already and the messenger gone
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel
that he his high authority abus'd
and did deserve his change for what I have conquer'd
I grant him part but then in his Armenia
and other of his conquer'd kingdoms I
demand the like

he'll never yield to that

nor must not then be yielded to in this

hail C sar and my lord hail most dear C sar

that ever I should call thee cast-away

you have not call'd me so nor have you cause

why have you stol'n upon us thus You come not
like C sar's sister the wife of Antony
should have an army for an usher and
the neighs of horse to tell of her approach
long ere she did appear the trees by the way
should have borne men and expectation fainted
longing for what it had not nay the dust
should have ascended to the roof of heaven
rais'd by your populous troops But you are come
a market-maid to Rome and have prevented
the ostentation of our love which left unshown
is often left unlov'd we should have met you
with an augmented greeting

good my lord
to come thus was I not constrain'd but did it
on my free-will My lord Mark Antony
hearing that you prepar'd for war acquainted
my grieved ear withal whereon I begg'd
his pardon for return

which soon he granted
being an obstruct tween his lust and him

do not say so my lord

I have eyes upon him
and his affairs come to me on the wind
where is he now

my lord in Athens
no my most wrong'd sister Cleopatra
hath nodded him to her He hath given his empire
up to a whore who now are levying
the kings o' the earth for war He hath assembled
bocchus the King of Libya Archelaus
of Cappadocia Philadelphos King
of Paphlagonia the Thracian king Adallas
king Malchus of Arabia King of Pont
Herod of Jewry Mithridates King
of Comagene Polemon and Amintas
the Kings of Mede and Lycaonia
with a more larger list of sceptres

ay me most wretched
that have my heart parted betwixt two friends
that do afflict each other

welcome hither
your letters did withhold our breaking forth
and we in negligent danger Cheer your heart
be you not troubled with the time which drives
o'er your content these strong necessities
but let determin'd things to destiny
hold unbewail'd their way Welcome to Rome
nothing more dear to me You are abus'd
beyond the mark of thought and the high gods
to do you justice make their ministers
of us and those that love you Best of comfort
and ever welcome to us

welcome lady

welcome dear madam
each heart in Rome does love and pity you
only the adulterous Antony most large
in his abominations turns you off
and gives his potent regiment to a trull
that noises it against us
is it so sir

most certain Sister welcome pray you
be ever known to patience my dearest sister


I will be even with thee doubt it not

but why why why

thou hast forspoke my being in these wars
and sayst it is not fit

well is it is it

if not denounc'd against us why should not we
be there in person

well I could reply
the horse were merely lost the mares would bear
a soldier and his horse

what is t you say

your presence needs must puzzle Antony
take from his heart take from his brain from s time
what should not then be spar'd He is already
traduc'd for levity and tis said in Rome
that Photinus a eunuch and your maids
manage this war

sink Rome and their tongues rot
that speak against us A charge we bear i' the war
and as the president of my kingdom will
appear there for a man Speak not against it
I will not stay behind

nay I have done


is it not strange Canidius
that from Tarentum and Brundusium
he could so quickly cut the Ionian sea
and take in Toryne You have heard on t sweet

celerity is never more admir'd
than by the negligent

a good rebuke
which might have well becom'd the best of men
to taunt at slackness Canidius we
will fight with him by sea

by sea What else

why will my lord do so


so hath my lord dar'd him to single fight

ay and to wage his battle at Pharsalia
where C sar fought with Pompey but these offers
which serve not for his vantage he shakes off
and so should you

your ships are not well mann'd
your mariners are muleters reapers people
ingross'd by swift impress in C sar's fleet
are those that often have gainst Pompey fought
their ships are yare yours heavy No disgrace
shall fall you for refusing him at sea
being prepar'd for land

by sea by sea

most worthy sir you therein throw away
distract your army which doth most consist
of war-mark'd footmen leave unexecuted
your own renowned knowledge quite forego
the way which promises assurance and
give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
from firm security

I'll fight at sea

I have sixty sails C sar none better

our overplus of shipping will we burn
and with the rest full-mann'd from the head of Actium
beat the approaching C sar But if we fail
we then can do t at land

thy business

the news is true my lord he is descried

can he be there in person tis impossible
strange that his power should be Canidius
our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land
and our twelve thousand horse We'll to our ship
away my Thetis

how now worthy soldier

O noble emperor do not fight by sea
trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt
this sword and these my wounds Let the Egyptians
and the Ph nicians go a-ducking we
have used to conquer standing on the earth
and fighting foot to foot

well well away



soldier thou art but his whole action grows
not in the power on t so our leader's led
and we are women's men

you keep by land
the legions and the horse whole do you not

Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius
Publicola and C lius are for sea
but we keep whole by land This speed of C sar's
carries beyond belief

while he was yet in Rome
his power went out in such distractions as
beguil'd all spies

who's his lieutenant hear you


well I know the man


the emperor calls Canidius

with news the time's with labour and throes forth
each minute some


Taurus

my lord

strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle
till we have done at sea Do not exceed
the prescript of this scroll our fortune lies
upon this jump

in eye of C sar's battle from which place
we may the number of the ships behold
and so proceed accordingly


naught naught all naught I can behold no longer
the Antoniad the Egyptian admiral
with all their sixty fly and turn the rudder
to see t mine eyes are blasted


gods and goddesses
all the whole synod of them

what's thy passion

the greater cantle of the world is lost
with very ignorance we have kiss'd away
kingdoms and provinces
how appears the fight

on our side like the token'd pestilence
where death is sure Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt
whom leprosy o'ertake i' the midst o' the fight
when vantage like a pair of twins appear'd
both as the same or rather ours the elder
the breese upon her like a cow in June
hoists sails and flies

that I beheld
mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
endure a further view

she once being loof'd
the noble ruin of her magic Antony
clapson his sea-wing and like a doting mallard
leaving the fight in height flies after her
I never saw an action of such shame
did violate so itself

alack alack


our fortune on the sea is out of breath
and sinks most lamentably Had our general
been what he knew himself it had gone well
O he has given example for our flight
most grossly by his own

ay are you thereabouts
why then good night indeed

towards Peloponnesus are they fled

'Tis easy to t and there I will attend
what further comes

my legions and my horse six kings already
show me the way of yielding

I'll yet follow
the wounded chance of Antony though my reason
sits in the wind against me


hark the land bids me tread no more upon t
it is asham'd to bear me Friends come hither
I am so lated in the world that I
have lost my way for ever I have a ship
laden with gold take that divide it fly
and make your peace with C sar

fly not we

I have fled myself and have instructed cowards
to run and show their shoulders Friends be gone
which has no need of you be gone
my treasure's in the harbour take it O
I follow'd that I blush to look upon
my very hairs do mutiny for the white
reprove the brown for rashness and they them
for fear and doting Friends be gone you shall
have letters from me to some friends that will
sweep your way for you Pray you look not sad
nor make replies of loathness take the hint
which my despair proclaims let that be left
which leaves itself to the sea-side straightway
I will possess you of that ship and treasure
leave me I pray a little pray you now
nay do so for indeed I have lost command
therefore I pray you I'll see you by and by

nay gentle madam to him comfort him

do most dear queen
do Why what else

let me sit down O Juno

no no no no no

see you here sir

O fie fie fie

madam

madam O good empress

sir sir

yes my lord yes He at Philippi kept
his sword e'en like a dancer while I struck
the lean and wrinkled Cassius and twas I
dealt on lieutenantry and no practice had
in the brave squares of war yet now No matter

Ah stand by

the queen my lord the queen

go to him madam speak to him
he is unqualitied with very shame

well then sustain me O

most noble sir arise the queen approaches
her head's declin'd and death will seize her but
your comfort makes the rescue

I have offended reputation
a most unnoble swerving


O whither hast thou led me Egypt See
how I convey my shame out of thine eyes
by looking back what I have left behind
'Stroy'd in dishonour

O my lord my lord
forgive my fearful sails I little thought
you would have follow'd

Egypt thou knew'st too well
my heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings
and thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit
thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that
thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
command me

O my pardon

to the young man send humble treaties dodge
and palter in the shifts of lowness who
with half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleas'd
making and marring fortunes You did know
how much you were my conqueror and that
my sword made weak by my affection would
obey it on all cause

pardon pardon

fall not a tear I say one of them rates
all that is won and lost Give me a kiss
even this repays me We sent our schoolmaster
is he come back Love I am full of lead
some wine within there and our viands Fortune knows
we scorn her most when most she offers blows

let him appear that's come from Antony
know you him
C sar tis his schoolmaster
an argument that he is pluck'd when hither
he sends so poor a pinion of his wing
which had superfluous kings for messengers
not many moons gone by


approach and speak

such as I am I come from Antony
I was of late as petty to his ends
as is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
to his grand sea

be t so Declare thine office

lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and
requires to live in Egypt which not granted
he lessens his requests and to thee sues
a private man in Athens this for him
next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness
submits her to thy might and of thee craves
the circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs
now hazarded to thy grace

for Antony
I have no ears to his request The queen
of audience nor desire shall fail so she
from Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend
or take his life there this if she perform
she shall not sue unheard So to them both

fortune pursue thee

bring him through the bands

from Antony win Cleopatra promise
and in our name what she requires add more
in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure
the ne'er-touch'd vestal Try thy cunning Thyreus
make thine own edict for thy pains which we

will answer as a law

C sar I go

observe how Antony becomes his flaw
and what thou think'st his very action speaks
in every power that moves

C sar I shall

what shall we do Enobarbus

think and die

is Antony or we in fault for this
Antony only that would make his will
lord of his reason What though you fled
from that great face of war whose several ranges
frighted each other why should he follow
the itch of his affection should not then
have nick'd his captainship at such a point
when half to half the world oppos'd he being
the mered question Twas a shame no less
than was his loss to course your flying flags
and leave his navy gazing

prithee peace


is that his answer

ay my lord

the queen shall then have courtesy so she

he says so

let her know't
to the boy C sar send this grizzled head
and he will fill thy wishes to the brim
with principalities

that head my lord

to him again Tell him he wears the rose
of youth upon him from which the world should note
something particular his coin ships legions
may be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
under the service of a child as soon
as i' the command of C sar I dare him therefore
to lay his gay comparisons apart
and answer me declin'd sword against sword
ourselves alone I'll write it follow me

yes like enough high-battled C sar will
unstate his happiness and be stag'd to the show
against a sworder I see men's judgments are
a parcel of their fortunes and things outward
do draw the inward quality after them
to suffer all alike That he should dream
knowing all measures the full C sar will
answer his emptiness C sar thou hast subdu'd
his judgment too


a messenger from C sar

what no more ceremony See my women
against the blown rose may they stop their nose
that kneel'd unto the buds Admit him sir


the loyalty well held to fools does make
our faith mere folly yet he that can endure
to follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
does conquer him that did his master conquer
and earns a place i' the story


C sar's will

hear it apart

none but friends say boldly

so haply are they friends to Antony

he needs as many sir as C sar has
or needs not us If C sar please our master
will leap to be his friend for us you know
whose he is we are and that is C sar's
so
thus then thou most renown'd C sar entreats
not to consider in what case thou stand'st
further than he is C sar

go on right royal

he knows that you embrace not Antony
as you did love but as you fear'd him

O 

the scars upon your honour therefore he
does pity as constrained blemishes
not as deserv'd

he is a god and knows
what is most right Mine honour was not yielded
but conquer'd merely
to be sure of that
I will ask Antony Sir sir thou'rt so leaky
that we must leave thee to thy sinking for
thy dearest quit thee


shall I say to C sar
what you require of him for he partly begs
to be desir'd to give It much would please him
that of his fortunes you should make a staff
to lean upon but it would warm his spirits
to hear from me you had left Antony
and put yourself under his shroud
the universal landlord

what's your name

my name is Thyreus

say to great C sar this in deputation
I kiss his conqu'ring hand tell him I am prompt
to lay my crown at s feet and there to kneel
tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
the doom of Egypt

'Tis your noblest course
wisdom and fortune combating together
if that the former dare but what it can
no chance may shake it Give me grace to lay
my duty on your hand

your C sar's father oft
when he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in
bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place
as it rain'd kisses


favours by Jove that thunders

one that but performs
the bidding of the fullest man and worthiest
to have command obey'd

you will be whipp'd

approach there Ah you kite Now gods and devils
authority melts from me of late when I cried Ho
like boys unto a muss kings would start forth
and cry Your will Have you no ears I am
Antony yet

take hence this Jack and whip him

'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
than with an old one dying

moon and stars
that do acknowledge C sar should I find them
so saucy with the hand of she here what's her name
since she was Cleopatra Whip him fellows
till like a boy you see him cringe his face
and whine aloud for mercy take him hence

mark Antony

tug him away being whipp'd
bring him again this Jack of C sar's shall
bear us an errand to him

you were half blasted ere I knew you ha
have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome
forborne the getting of a lawful race
and by a gem of women to be abus'd
by one that looks on feeders

good my lord
you have been a boggler ever
but when we in our viciousness grow hard
O misery on t the wise gods seel our eyes
in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
adore our errors laugh at s while we strut
to our confusion

O is't come to this

I found you as a morsel cold upon
dead C sar's trencher nay you were a fragment
of Cneius Pompey's besides what hotter hours
unregister'd in vulgar fame you have
luxuriously pick'd out for I am sure
though you can guess what temperance should be
you know not what it is

wherefore is this

and say God quit you be familiar with
my playfellow your hand this kingly seal
and plighter of high hearts O that I were
upon the hill of Basan to outroar
the horned herd for I have savage cause
and to proclaim it civilly were like
a halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
for being yare about him

is he whipp'd

soundly my lord

cried he and begg'd a' pardon

he did ask favour

if that thy father live let him repent
thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
thou hast been whipp'd for following him henceforth
the white hand of a lady fever thee
shake thou to look on t Get thee back to C sar
tell him thy entertainment look thou say
he makes me angry with him for he seems
proud and disdainful harping on what I am
not what he knew I was he makes me angry
and at this time most easy tis to do t
when my good stars that were my former guides
have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
into the abysm of hell If he mislike
my speech and what is done tell him he has
hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
as he shall like to quit me urge it thou
hence with thy stripes be gone


have you done yet
alack our terrene moon
is now eclips'd and it portends alone
the fall of Antony

I must stay his time

to flatter C sar would you mingle eyes
with one that ties his points

not know me yet

cold-hearted toward me

Ah dear if I be so
from my cold heart let heaven engender hail
and poison it in the source and the first stone
drop in my neck as it determines so
dissolve my life The next C sarion smite
till by degrees the memory of my womb
by the discandying of this pelleted storm
lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile
have buried them for prey

I am satisfied
C sar sits down in Alexandria where
I will oppose his fate Our force by land
hath nobly held our sever'd navy too
have knit again and fleet threat'ning most sea-like
where hast thou been my heart Dost thou hear lady
if from the field I shall return once more
to kiss these lips I will appear in blood
I and my sword will earn our chronicle
there's hope in t yet

that's my brave lord

I will betreble-sinew'd hearted breath'd
and fight maliciously for when mine hours
of me for jests but now I'll set my teeth
and send to darkness all that stop me Come
let's have one other gaudy night call to me
all my sad captains fill our bowls once more
let's mock the midnight bell

it is my birth-day
I had thought to have held it poor but since my lord
is Antony again I will be Cleopatra

we will yet do well

call all his noble captains to my lord

do so we'll speak to them and to-night I'll force
the wine peep through their scars Come on my queen
there's sap in t yet The next time I do fight
I'll make death love me for I will contend
even with his pestilent scythe

now he'll outstare the lightning To be furious
is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood
the dove will peck the estridge and I see still
a diminution in our captain's brain
restores his heart When valour preys on reason
it eats the sword it fights with I will seek
some way to leave him

he calls me boy and chides as he had power
to beat me out of Egypt my messenger
he hath whipp'd with rods dares me to personal combat
C sar to Antony Let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die meantime
laugh at his challenge

C sar must think
when one so great begins to rage he's hunted
even to falling Give him no breath but now
made good guard for itself

let our best heads
know that to-morrow the last of many battles
we mean to fight Within our files there are
of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late
enough to fetch him in See it done
and feast the army we have store to do t
and they have earn'd the waste Poor Antony


he will not fight with me Domitius

no

why should he not

he thinks being twenty times of better fortune
he is twenty men to one
to-morrow soldier
by sea and land I'll fight or I will live
or bathe my dying honour in the blood
shall make it live again Woo't thou fight well

I'll strike and cry Take all

well said come on
call forth my household servants let's to-night
be bounteous at our meal


give me thy hand
thou hast been rightly honest so hast thou
thou and thou and thou you have serv'd me well

and kings have been your fellows

what means this
'Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots
out of the mind

and thou art honest too
I wish I could be made so many men
and all of you clapp'd up together in
an Antony that I might do you service
so good as you have done

the gods forbid

well my good fellows wait on me to-night
scant not my cups and make as much of me
as when mine empire was your fellow too
and suffer'd my command

what does he mean

to make his followers weep
tend me to-night
may be it is the period of your duty
haply you shall not see me more or if
a mangled shadow perchance to-morrow
you'll serve another master I look on you
as one that takes his leave Mine honest friends
I turn you not away but like a master
married to your good service stay till death
tend me to-night two hours I ask no more
and the gods yield you for t

what mean you sir
to give them this discomfort Look they weep
and I an ass am onion-ey'd for shame
transform us not to women

ho ho ho
now the witch take me if I meant it thus
Grace grow where those drops fall My hearty friends
for I spake to you for your comfort did desire you
to burn this night with torches Know my hearts
I hope well of to-morrow and will lead you
where rather I'll expect victorious life
than death and honour Let's to supper come
and drown consideration


brother good night to-morrow is the day

it will determine one way fare you well
heard you of nothing strange about the streets

nothing What news

belike tis but a rumour Good night to you

well sir good night

and full of purpose

ay is t not strange

do you hear masters do you hear

follow the noise so far as we have quarter

content Tis strange

because we brave her Come

briefly sir

rarely rarely
he that unbuckles this till we do please
to daff t for our repose shall hear a storm
thou fumblest Eros and my queen's a squire
more tight at this than thou dispatch O love
that thou couldst see my wars to-day and knew'st
the royal occupation thou shouldst see
a workman in t


good morrow to thee welcome

to business that we love we rise betime

and go to t with delight

a thousand sir

and at the port expect you

'Tis well blown lads
this morning like the spirit of a youth
that means to be of note begins betimes
so so come give me that this way well said
fare thee well dame whate'er becomes of me
this is a soldier's kiss

rebukeable
and worthy shameful check it were to stand
on more mechanic compliment I'll leave thee
now like a man of steel You that will fight
follow me close I'll bring you to t Adieu


please you retire to your chamber
lead me
he goes forth gallantly That he and C sar might
determine this great war in single fight
then Antony but now Well on


the gods make this a happy day to Antony

would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
to make me fight at land

hadst thou done so
the kings that have revolted and the soldier
that has this morning left thee would have still
follow'd thy heels

who's gone this morning

who
he shall not hear thee or from C sar's camp
say I am none of thine

what sayst thou

sir
he is with C sar

sir his chests and treasure
he has not with him

is he gone

most certain

go Eros send his treasure after do it
detain no jot I charge thee Write to him
I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings
say that I wish he never find more cause
corrupted honest men Dispatch Enobarbus


go forth Agrippa and begin the fight
our will is Antony be took alive
make it so known

C sar I shall


the time of universal peace is near
prove this a prosperous day the three-nook'd world
shall bear the olive freely


Antony
is come into the field

go charge Agrippa
that Antony may seem to spend his fury
upon himself


Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
affairs of Antony there did persuade
great Herod to incline himself to C sar
and leave his master Antony for this pains
C sar hath hang'd him Canidius and the rest
that fell away have entertainment but
no honourable trust I have done ill
of which I do accuse myself so sorely
that I will joy no more


Enobarbus Antony
hath after thee sent all thy treasure with
his bounty overplus the messenger
came on my guard and at thy tent is now

I give it you

mock not Enobarbus
I tell you true best you saf'd the bringer
out of the host I must attend mine office
or would have done t myself Your emperor
continues still a Jove


I am alone the villain of the earth
and feel I am so most O Antony
thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid
my better service when my turpitude
thou dost so crown with gold This blows my heart
if swift thought break it not a swifter mean
shall outstrike thought but thought will do t I feel
I fight against thee No I will go seek
some ditch wherein to die the foul'st best fits


retire we have engag'd ourselves too far
C sar himself has work and our oppression
exceeds what we expected

O my brave emperor this is fought indeed
had we done so at first we had droven them home
with clouts about their heads

thou bleed'st apace

I had a wound here that was like a T
but now tis made an H

they do retire

we'll beat em into bench-holes I have yet
room for six scotches more

they are beaten sir and our advantage serves
for a fair victory

let us score their backs
and snatch em up as we take hares behind
'Tis sport to maul a runner

I will reward thee
once for thy sprightly comfort and ten-fold
for thy good valour Come thee on

I'll halt after


we have beat him to his camp run one before
and let the queen know of our gests To-morrow
before the sun shall see s we'll spill the blood
that has to-day escap'd I thank you all
not as you serv'd the cause but as t had been
each man's like mine you have shown all Hectors
enter the city clip your wives your friends
tell them your feats whilst they with joyful tears
wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
the honour'd gashes whole

give me thy hand


to this great fairy I'll commend thy acts
make her thanks bless thee O thou day o' the world
chain mine arm'd neck leap thou attire and all
through proof of harness to my heart and there

ride on the pants triumphing

lord of lords
O infinite virtue com'st thou smiling from

my nightingale
we have beat them to their beds What girl though grey
do something mingle with our younger brown yet ha' we
a brain that nourishes our nerves and can
get goal for goal of youth Behold this man
commend unto his lips thy favouring hand
kiss it my warrior he hath fought to-day
as if a god in hate of mankind had
destroy'd in such a shape

I'll give thee friend
an armour all of gold it was a king's

he has deserv'd it were it carbuncled
like holy Ph bus' car Give me thy hand
through Alexandria make a jolly march
bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them
had our great palace the capacity
and drink carouses to the next day's fate
which promises royal peril Trumpeters
with brazen din blast you the city's ear
make mingle with our rattling tabourines
that heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
applauding our approach


if we be not reliev'd within this hour
we must return to the court of guard the night
is shiny and they say we shall embattle
by the second hour i' the morn

this last day was
a shrewd one to s


O bear me witness night


stand close and list him

be witness to me O thou blessed moon
when men revolted shall upon record
bear hateful memory poor Enobarbus did
before thy face repent

Enobarbus

peace
hark further

O sovereign mistress of true melancholy
the poisonous damp of night disponge upon me
that life a very rebel to my will
may hang no longer on me throw my heart
against the flint and hardness of my fault
which being dried with grief will break to powder
nobler than my revolt is infamous
forgive me in thine own particular
but let the world rank me in register
a master-leaver and a fugitive
O Antony O Antony


let's speak to him

let's hear him for the things he speaks
may concern C sar

let's do so But he sleeps

swounds rather for so bad a prayer as his
was never yet for sleep

go we to him


hear you sir

the Land of death hath raught him

hark the drums
demurely wake the sleepers Let us bear him
to the court of guard he is of note our hour
is fully out

come on then
he may recover yet

their preparation is to-day by sea
we please them not by land

for both my lord

I would they'd fight i' the fire or i' the air
upon the hills adjoining to the city
shall stay with us order for sea is given
they have put forth the haven
where their appointment we may best discover
and look on their endeavour

but being charg'd we will be still by land
which as I take t we shall for his best force
is forth to man his galleys To the vales
and hold our best advantage

yet they are not join'd Where yond pine does stand
I shall discover all I'll bring thee word
straight how tis like to go


swallows have built
in Cleopatra's sails their nests the augurers
say they know not they cannot tell look grimly
is valiant and dejected and by starts
his fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
of what he has and has not

all is lost
this foul Egyptian hath betrayed me
my fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder
they cast their caps up and carouse together
like friends long lost Triple-turn'd whore tis thou
hast sold me to this novice and my heart
makes only wars on thee Bid them all fly
for when I am reveng'd upon my charm
I have done all Bid them all fly be gone

O sun thy uprise shall I see no more
fortune and Antony part here even here
do we shake hands All come to this The hearts
that spaniel'd me at heels to whom I gave
their wishes do discandy melt their sweets
that overtopp'd them all Betray'd I am
O this false soul of Egypt this grave charm
whose eyes beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home
whose bosom was my crownet my chief end
like a right gipsy hath at fast and loose
beguil'd me to the very heart of loss
what Eros Eros

Ah thou spell Avaunt

why is my lord enrag'd against his love

vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving
and blemish C sar's triumph Let him take thee
and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians
follow his chariot like the greatest spot
of all thy sex most monster-like be shown
for poor'st diminutives for doits and let
patient Octavia plough thy visage up

'Tis well thou'rt gone
if it be well to live but better twere
thou fell'st into my fury for one death
might have prevented many Eros ho
the shirt of Nessus is upon me teach me
Alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage
let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon
and with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
subdue my worthiest self The witch shall die
to the young Roman boy she hath sold me and I fall
under this plot she dies for t Eros ho

help me my women O he is more mad
than Telamon for his shield the boar of Thessaly
was never so emboss'd

to the monument
there lock yourself and send him word you are dead
than greatness going off

to the monument
Mardian go tell him I have slain myself
say that the last I spoke was Antony
and word it prithee piteously Hence
Mardian and bring me how he takes my death
to the monument

Eros thou yet behold'st me

ay noble lord

sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish
a vapour sometime like a bear or lion
a tower'd citadel a pendant rock
a forked mountain or blue promontory
with trees upon t that nod unto the world
and mock our eyes with air thou hast seen these signs

ay my lord

that which is now a horse even with a thought
the rack dislimns and makes it indistinct
as water is in water

it does my lord

my good knave Eros now thy captain is
even such a body here I am Antony
yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave
I made these wars for Egypt and the queen
whose heart I thought I had for she had mine
which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto t
a million more now lost she Eros has
pack'd cards with C sar and false-play'd my glory
unto an enemy's triumph
nay weep not gentle Eros there is left us


O thy vile lady

she has robb'd me of my sword

no Antony
my mistress lov'd thee and her fortunes mingled
with thine entirely

hence saucy eunuch peace
she hath betray'd me and shall die the death

death of one person can be paid but once
and that she has discharg'd What thou wouldst do
is done unto thy hand the last she spake
was Antony most noble Antony
then in the midst a tearing groan did break
the name of Antony it was divided
thy name so buried in her

dead then

dead

unarm Eros the long day's task is done
and we must sleep

that thou depart'st hence safe
does pay thy labour richly go

off pluck off
the seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
the battery from my heart O cleave my sides
heart once be stronger than thy continent
crack thy frail case Apace Eros apace
no more a soldier bruised pieces go
you have been nobly borne From me awhile
I will o'ertake thee Cleopatra and
weep for my pardon So it must be for now
all length is torture since the torch is out
lie down and stray no further Now all labour
Mars what it does yea very force entangles
itself with strength seal then and all is done
Eros I come my queen Eros Stay for me
where souls do couch on flowers we'll hand in hand
and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze
Dido and her neas shall want troops
and all the haunt be ours Come Eros Eros


what would my lord

since Cleopatra died
I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
detest my baseness I that with my sword
quarter'd the world and o'er green Neptune's back
the courage of a woman less noble mind
than she which by her death our C sar tells
'I am conqueror of myself Thou art sworn Eros
that when the exigent should come which now
is come indeed when I should see behind me
the inevitable prosecution of
disgrace and horror that on my command
thou then wouldst kill me do t the time is come
thou strik'st not me tis C sar thou defeat'st
put colour in thy cheek

the gods withhold me
shall I do that which all the Parthian darts
though enemy lost aim and could not

Eros
wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
thy master thus with pleach'd arms bending down
his corrigible neck his face subdu'd
of fortunate C sar drawn before him branded
his baseness that ensu'd

I would not see't

come then for with a wound I must be cur'd
draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn
most useful for thy country

O sir pardon me

when I did make thee free swor'st thou not then
to do this when I bade thee Do it at once
or thy precedent services are all
but accidents unpurpos'd Draw and come

turn from me then that noble countenance
wherein the worship of the whole world lies



my sword is drawn

then let it do at once
the thing why thou hast drawn it

my dear master
my captain and my emperor let me say
before I strike this bloody stroke farewell

'Tis said man and farewell

farewell great chief Shall I strike now

now Eros

why there then thus do I escape the sorrow


thrice-nobler than myself
thou teachest me O valiant Eros what
I should and thou couldst not My queen and Eros
have by their brave instruction got upon me
a nobleness in record but I will be
a bridegroom in my death and run into t
as to a lover's bed Come then and Eros
thy master dies thy scholar to do thus

I learn'd of thee How not dead not dead
the guard ho O dispatch me


what's the noise

I have done my work ill friends O make an end
of what I have begun


and time is at his period

alas and woe

let him that loves me strike me dead

not I

nor I

nor any one


thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly
this sword but shown to C sar with this tidings
shall enter me with him



there Diomed there

lives he
wilt thou not answer man


art thou there Diomed Draw thy sword and give me
sufficing strokes for death

most absolute lord
my mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee

when did she send thee

now my lord

where is she

of what hath come to pass for when she saw
which never shall be found you did suspect
she had dispos'd with C sar and that your rage
would not be purg'd she sent you word she was dead
but fearing since how it might work hath sent
me to proclaim the truth and I am come
I dread too late

too late good Diomed Call my guard I prithee

what ho the emperor's guard The guard what ho
come your lord calls


bear me good friends where Cleopatra bides
'Tis the last service that I shall command you

woe woe are we sir you may not live to wear
all your true followers out
most heavy day

nay good my fellows do not please sharp fate
to grace it with your sorrows bid that welcome
which comes to punish us and we punish it
seeming to bear it lightly Take me up
I have led you oft carry me now good friends
and have my thanks for all

O Charmian I will never go from hence

be comforted dear madam

no I will not
all strange and terrible events are welcome
but comforts we despise our size of sorrow
proportion'd to our cause must be as great
as that which makes it


his death's upon him but not dead
look out o' the other side your monument
his guard have brought him thither


O sun
burn the great sphere thou mov'st in darkling stand
the varying star o' the world O Antony
Antony Antony Help Charmian help Iras help
help friends below let's draw him hither

peace
not C sar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony
but Antony's hath triumph'd on itself

so it should be that none but Antony
should conquer Antony but woe tis so

I here importune death awhile until
of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay upon thy lips

I dare not dear
dear my lord pardon I dare not
lest I be taken not the imperious show
of the full-fortun'd C sar ever shall
be brooch'd with me if knife drugs serpents have
edge sting or operation I am safe
your wife Octavia with her modest eyes
and still conclusion shall acquire no honour
demuring upon me But come come Antony
help me my women we must draw thee up
assist good friends

O quick or I am gone

here's sport indeed How heavy weighs my lord
that makes the weight Had I great Juno's power
the strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up
and set thee by Jove's side Yet come a little
wishers were ever fools O come come come

and welcome welcome die where thou hastliv'd
quicken with kissing had my lips that power
thus would I wear them out

a heavy sight

I am dying Egypt dying
give me some wine and let me speak a little

no let me speak and let me rail so high
that the false housewife Fortune break her wheel
provok'd by my offence

one word sweet queen

they do not go together

gentle hear me
none about C sar trust but Proculeius

my resolution and my hands I'll trust
none about C sar

the miserable change now at my end
lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts
in feeding them with those my former fortunes
wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' the world
the noblest and do now not basely die
not cowardly put off my helmet to
my countryman a Roman by a Roman
valiantly vanquish'd Now my spirit is going
I can no more

hast thou no care of me shall I abide
in this dull world which in thy absence is
no better than a sty O see my women

the crown o' the earth doth melt My lord
O wither'd is the garland of the war
the soldier's pole is fall'n young boys and girls
are level now with men the odds is gone
and there is nothing left remarkable
beneath the visiting moon


O quietness lady

she is dead too our sovereign

lady

madam
O madam madam madam

royal Egypt
empress

peace peace Iras

no more but e'en a woman and commanded
by such poor passion as the maid that milks
and does the meanest chares It were for me
to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
to tell them that this world did equal theirs
till they had stol'n our jewel All's but naught
patience is sottish and impatience does
become a dog that's mad then is it sin
to rush into the secret house of death
ere death dare come to us How do you women
what what good cheer Why how now Charmian
my noble girls Ah women women look
we'll bury him and then what's brave what's noble
let's do it after the high Roman fashion
and make death proud to take us Come away
this case of that huge spirit now is cold
Ah women women Come we have no friend
but resolution and the briefest end

go to him Dolabella bid him yield
being so frustrate tell him he mocks
the pauses that he makes

C sar I shall

wherefore is that and what art thou that dar'st
appear thus to us

I am call'd Dercetas
mark Antony I serv'd who best was worthy
best to be serv'd whilst he stood up and spoke
to spend upon his haters If thou please
to take me to thee as I was to him
I'll be to C sar if thou pleasest not
I yield thee up my life

what is t thou sayst

I say O C sar Antony is dead

the breaking of so great a thing should make
a greater crack the round world
should have shook lions into civil streets
and citizens to their dens The death of Antony
is not a single doom in the name lay
a moiety of the world

he is dead C sar
not by a public minister of justice
nor by a hired knife but that self hand
hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
splitted the heart This is his sword
I robb'd his wound of it behold it stain'd
with his most noble blood

look you sad friends
the gods rebuke me but it is tidings
to wash the eyes of kings

and strange it is
that nature must compel us to lament
our most persisted deeds

his taints and honours
wag'd equal with him

a rarer spirit never
did steer humanity but you gods will give us
some faults to make us men C sar is touch'd
when such a spacious mirror's set before him
he needs must see himself

O Antony
I have follow'd thee to this but we do lance
diseases in our bodies I must perforce
have shown to thee such a declining day
or look on thine we could not stall together
in the whole world But yet let me lament
with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
that thou my brother my competitor
in top of all design my mate in empire
friend and companion in the front of war
the arm of mine own body and the heart
where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars
unreconciliable should divide
our equalness to this Hear me good friends


the business of this man looks out of him

we'll hear him what he says Whence are you

a poor Egyptian yet The queen my mistress
confin'd in all she has her monument
of thy intents desires instruction
that she preparedly may frame herself
to the way she's forc'd to

bid her have good heart
she soon shall know of us by some of ours
how honourable and how kindly we
determine for her for C sar cannot live
to be ungentle

so the gods preserve thee


we purpose her no shame give her what comforts
the quality of her passion shall require
lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke
she do defeat us for her life in Rome
would be eternal in our triumph Go
and with your speediest bring us what she says
and how you find of her

C sar I shall


gallus go you along

to second Proculeius

Dolabella

Dolabella

how he's employ'd he shall in time be ready
go with me to my tent where you shall see
how hardly I was drawn into this war
how calm and gentle I proceeded still
in all my writings Go with me and see
what I can show in this


my desolation does begin to make
a better life Tis paltry to be C sar
not being Fortune he's but Fortune's knave
a minister of her will and it is great
to do that thing that ends all other deeds
which shackles accidents and bolts up change
which sleeps and never palates more the dug
the beggar's nurse and C sar's


C sar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt
thou mean'st to have him grant thee

what's thy name

my name is Proculeius

Antony
did tell me of you bade me trust you but
I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd
that have no use for trusting If your master
would have a queen his beggar you must tell him
that majesty to keep decorum must
no less beg than a kingdom if he please
to give me conquer'd Egypt for my son
he gives me so much of mine own as I
will kneel to him with thanks

be of good cheer
you're fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing
who is so full of grace that it flows over
on all that need let me report to him
your sweet dependancy and you shall find
a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
where he for grace is kneel'd to

pray you tell him
I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
the greatness he has got I hourly learn
a doctrine of obedience and would gladly
look him i' the face

this I'll report dear lady
have comfort for I know your plight is pitied
of him that caus'd it

you see how easily she may be surpris'd



royal queen

O Cleopatra thou art taken queen

quick quick good hands


hold worthy lady hold

do not yourself such wrong who are in this
reliev'd but not betray'd

what of death too
that rids our dogs of languish

Cleopatra
do not abuse my master's bounty by
the undoing of yourself let the world see
will never let come forth

where art thou death
come hither come come come and take a queen
worth many babes and beggars

O temperance lady

sir I will eat no meat I'll not drink sir
if idle talk will once be necessary
I'll not sleep neither This mortal house I'll ruin
do C sar what he can Know sir that I
will not wait pinion'd at your master's court
nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
of dull Octavia Shall they hoist me up
and show me to the shouting varletry
of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt
be gentle grave unto me rather on Nilus' mud
lay me stark nak'd and let the water-flies
my country's high pyramides my gibbet
and hang me up in chains

you do extend
these thoughts of horror further than you shall
find cause in C sar


Proculeius
what thou hast done thy master C sar knows
and he hath sent for thee as for the queen
I'll take her to my guard

so Dolabella
it shall content me best be gentle to her


to C sar I will speak what you shall please
if you'll employ me to him
say I would die


most noble empress you have heard of me

I cannot tell

assuredly you know me

no matter sir what I have heard or known
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
is t not your trick

I understand not madam

I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony
O such another sleep that I might see
but such another man


his face was as the heavens and therein stuck
a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted
the little O the earth

most sovereign creature

his legs besfrid the ocean his rear'd arm
crested the world his voice was propertied
as all the tuned spheres and that to friends
but when he meant to quail and shake the orb
he was as rattling thunder For his bounty
there was no winter in t an autumn twas
that grew the more by reaping his delights
were dolphin-like they show'd his back above
the element they liv'd in in his livery
walk'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were
as plates dropp'd from his pocket


think you there was or might be such a man
as this I dream'd of

gentle madam no

you lie up to the hearing of the gods
but if there be or ever were one such
it's past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff
to vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine
an Antony were nature's piece gainst fancy
condemning shadows quite

hear me good madam
your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
as answering to the weight would I might never
o'ertake pursu'd success but I do feel
by the rebound of yours a grief that smites
my very heart at root
I thank you sir
know you what C sar means to do with me

I am loath to tell you what I would you knew

nay pray you sir

though he be honourable

he'll lead me then in triumph

madam he will I know t

which is the Queen of Egypt

it is the emperor madam


arise you shall not kneel

sir the gods
will have it thus my master and my lord
I must obey

take to you no hard thoughts
the record of what injuries you did us
though written in our flesh we shall remember
as things but done by chance

sole sir o' the world
I cannot project mine own cause so well
to make it clear but do confess I have
been laden with like frailties which before
have often sham'd our sex

Cleopatra know
we will extenuate rather than enforce
if you apply yourself to our intents
a benefit in this change but if you seek
to lay on me a cruelty by taking
Antony's course you shall bereave yourself
of my good purposes and put your children
to that destruction which I'll guard them from
if thereon you rely I'll take my leave

and may through all the world tis yours and we
your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
hang in what place you please Here my good lord

you shall advise me in all for Cleopatra

this is the brief of money plate and jewels
I am possess'd of tis exactly valued
not petty things admitted Where's Seleucus

here madam

upon his peril that I have reserv'd
to myself nothing Speak the truth Seleucus

madam
I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
speak that which is not

what have I kept back

enough to purchase what you have made known

nay blush not Cleopatra I approve
your wisdom in the deed

see C sar O behold
how pomp is follow'd mine will now be yours
and should we shift estates yours would be mine
the ingratitude of this Seleucus does
even make me wild O slave of no more trust
go back I warrant thee but I'll catch thine eyes
though they had wings slave soulless villain dog
O rarely base

good queen let us entreat you

O C sar what a wounding shame is this
that thou vouchsafing here to visit me
doing the honour of thy lordliness
to one so meek that mine own servant should
parcel the sum of my disgraces by
addition of his envy Say good C sar
that I some lady trifles have reserv'd
immoment toys things of such dignity
as we greet modern friends withal and say
some nobler token I have kept apart
for Livia and Octavia to induce
their mediation must I be unfolded
with one that I have bred The gods it smites me

prithee go hence
or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
through the ashes of my chance Wert thou a man
thou wouldst have mercy on me

forbear Seleucus


be it known that we the greatest are misthought
for things that others do and when we fall
we answer others' merits in our name
are therefore to be pitied

Cleopatra
not what you have reserv'd nor what acknowledg'd
put we i' the roll of conquest still be t yours
bestow it at your pleasure and believe
C sar's no merchant to make prize with you
make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen
for we intend so to dispose you as
yourself shall give us counsel Feed and sleep
our care and pity is so much upon you
that we remain your friend and so adieu

my master and my lord

not so Adieu


he words me girls he words me that I should not
be noble to myself but hark thee Charmian


finish good lady the bright day is done
and we are for the dark

hie thee again
go put it to the haste

madam I will


where is the queen

behold sir


Dolabella

madam as thereto sworn by your command
which my love makes religion to obey
I tell you this C sar through Syria
intends his journey and within three days
you with your children will be send before
make your best use of this I have perform'd
your pleasure and my promise
Dolabella
I shall remain your debtor

I your servant
adieu good queen I must attend on C sar

farewell and thanks

now Iras what think'st thou
thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
in Rome as well as I mechanic slaves
with greasy aprons rules and hammers shall
uplift us to the view in their thick breaths
rank of gross diet shall we be enclouded
and forc'd to drink their vapour

the gods forbid

nay tis most certain Iras Saucy lictors
ballad us out o' tune the quick comedians
extemporally will stage us and present
our Alexandrian revels Antony
shall be brought drunken forth and I shall see
some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
i' the posture of a whore

O the good gods

nay that's certain

I'll never see it for I am sure my nails
are stronger than mine eyes

why that's the way
to fool their preparation and to conquer
their most absurd intents


show me my women like a queen go fetch
my best attires I am again for Cydnus
to meet Mark Antony Sirrah Iras go
now noble Charmian we'll dispatch indeed
and when thou hast done this chare I'll give thee leave
to play till doomsday Bring our crown and all

wherefore's this noise

here is a rural fellow
that will not be denied your highness' presence
he brings you figs

let him come in

what poor an instrument
may do a noble deed he brings me liberty
my resolution's plac'd and I have nothing
of woman in me now from head to foot
no planet is of mine


this is the man

avoid and leave him

hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
that kills and pains not

truly I have him but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or never recover

remember'st thou any that have died on t

very many men and women too I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it what pain she felt Truly she makes a very good report o' the worm but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do But this is most fallible the worm's an odd worm

get thee hence farewell

I wish you all joy of the worm

farewell

you must think this look you that the worm will do his kind

ay ay farewell

look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm

take thou no care it shall be heeded

very good Give it nothing I pray you for it is not worth the feeding

will it eat me

you must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not But truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in every ten that they make the devils mar five

well get thee gone farewell


give me my robe put on my crown I have
immortal longings in me now no more
the juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip
yare yare good Iras quick Methinks I hear
Antony call I see him rouse himself
to praise my noble act I hear him mock
the luck of C sar which the gods give men
to excuse their after wrath husband I come
now to that name my courage prove my title
I am fire and air my other elements
I give to baser life So have you done
come then and take the last warmth of my lips
farewell kind Charmian Iras long farewell

have I the aspic in my lips Dost fall
if thou and nature can so gently part
the stroke of death is as a lover's pinch
which hurts and is desir'd Dost thou lie still
it is not worth leave-taking

dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say
the gods themselves do weep

this proves me base
if she first meet the curled Antony
he'll make demand of her and spend that kiss
which is my heaven to have Come thou mortal wretch

with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
of life at once untie poor venomous fool
be angry and dispatch O couldst thou speak
that I might hear thee call great C sar ass
unpolicied

O eastern star

peace peace
that sucks the nurse asleep

O break O break

as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle
O Antony Nay I will take thee too

what should I stay


in this vile world So fare thee well
now boast thee death in thy possession lies
a lass unparallel'd Downy windows close
and golden Ph bus never be beheld
of eyes again so royal Your crown's awry
I'll mend it and then play


where is the queen
speak softly wake her not

C sar hath sent

too slow a messenger

O come apace dispatch I partly feel thee

approach ho All's not well C sar's beguil'd

there's Dolabella sent from C sar call him

what work is here Charmian is this well done

it is well done and fitting for a princess
descended of so many royal kings
Ah soldier

how goes it here
all dead

C sar thy thoughts
touch their effects in this thyself art coming
to see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
so sought'st to hinder

O sir you are too sure an augurer
that you did fear is done

bravest at the last
she levell'd at our purposes and being royal
took her own way The manner of their deaths
I do not see them bleed

who was last with them

a simple countryman that brought her figs
this was his basket
poison'd then

O C sar
this Charmian liv'd but now she stood and spake
I found her trimming up the diadem
on her dead mistress tremblingly she stood
and on the sudden dropp'd

O noble weakness
if they had swallow'd poison twould appear
by external swelling but she looks like sleep
as she would catch another Antony
in her strong toil of grace

here on her breast
there is a vent of blood and something blown
the like is on her arm

this is an aspic's trail and these fig-leaves
upon the caves of Nile

most probable
that so she died for her physician tells me
she hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
of easy ways to die Take up her bed
and bear her women from the monument
she shall be buried by her Antony
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it
a pair so famous High events as these
strike those that make them and their story is
no less in pity than his glory which
brought them to be lamented Our army shall
in solemn show attend this funeral
and then to Rome Come Dolabella see
high order in this great solemnity

CORIOLANUS


speak speak

you are all resolved rather to die than to famish

resolved resolved

first you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people

we know't we know't

let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price Is't a verdict

no more talking on't let it be done
away away

one word good citizens

we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good What authority surfeits on would relieve us If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius

against him first he's a very dog to the commonalty

consider you what services he has done for his country

very well and could be content to give him good report for't but that he pays himself with being proud

nay but speak not maliciously

I say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue

what he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him You must in no way say he is covetous

if I must not I need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition

what shouts are these The other side o' the city is risen why stay we prating here to the Capitol

come come
soft who comes here


worthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always loved the people

he's one honest enough would all the rest were so

what work's my countrymen in hand Where go you
with bats and clubs The matter Speak I pray you

our business is not unknown to the senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we'll show em in deeds They say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too

why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
will you undo yourselves

we cannot sir we are undone already

I tell you friends most charitable care
have the patricians of you For your wants
strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
against the Roman state whose course will on
the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
of more strong link asunder than can ever
appear in your impediment For the dearth
the gods not the patricians make it and
your knees to them not arms must help Alack
you are transported by calamity
thither where more attends you and you slander
the helms o' the state who care for you like fathers
when you curse them as enemies

care for us True indeed They ne'er cared for us yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor If the wars eat us not up they will and there's all the love they bear us

either you must
confess yourselves wondrous malicious
or be accus'd of folly I shall tell you
a pretty tale it may be you have heard it
but since it serves my purpose I will venture

well I'll hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but an't please you deliver

there was a time when all the body's members
rebell'd against the belly thus accus'd it
that only like a gulf it did remain
i' the midst o' the body idle and unactive
still cupboarding the viand never bearing
like labour with the rest where the other instruments
did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
and mutually participate did minister
unto the appetite and affection common
of the whole body The belly answer'd

well sir what answer made the belly

sir I shall tell you With a kind of smile
which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus
for look you I may make the belly smile
to the discontented members the mutinous parts
that envied his receipt even so most fitly
as you malign our senators for that
they are not such as you

your belly's answer What
the kingly crowned head the vigilant eye
the counsellor heart the arm our soldier
our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
with other muniments and petty helps
in this our fabric if that they

what then
'Fore me this fellow speaks what then what then

should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd
who is the sink o' the body

well what then
the former agents if they did complain
what could the belly answer

I will tell you
if you'll bestow a small of what you have little
patience a while you'll hear the belly's answer

you're long about it

note me this good friend
your most grave belly was deliberate
not rash like his accusers and thus answer'd
'True is it my incorporate friends quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
which you do live upon and fit it is
because I am the store-house and the shop
of the whole body but if you do remember
I send it through the rivers of your blood
even to the court the heart to the seat o' the brain
the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
from me receive that natural competency
whereby they live And though that all at once
you my good friends this says the belly mark me

ay sir well well

'Though all at once cannot
see what I do deliver out to each
yet I can make my audit up that all
from me do back receive the flour of all
and leave me but the bran What say you to't

it was an answer how apply you this

the senators of Rome are this good belly
and you the mutinous members for examine
their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
touching the weal o' the common you shall find
but it proceeds or comes from them to you
and no way from yourselves What do you think
you the great toe of this assembly

I the great toe Why the great toe

for that being one o' the lowest basest poorest
of this most wise rebellion thou go'st foremost
thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
lead'st first to win some vantage
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle
the one side must have bale

hail noble Marcius

thanks What's the matter you dissentious rogues
that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
make yourselves scabs
we have ever your good word

he that will give good words to thee will flatter
beneath abhorring What would you have you curs
that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
the other makes you proud He that trusts to you
where he should find you lions finds you hares
where foxes geese you are no surer no
than is the coal of fire upon the ice
or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is
to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
and curse that justice did it Who deserves greatness
deserves your hate and your affections are
a sick man's appetite who desires most that
which would increase his evil He that depends
upon your favours swims with fins of lead
and hews down oaks with rushes Hang ye Trust ye
with every minute you do change a mind
and call him noble that was now your hate
that in these several places of the city
you cry against the noble senate who
under the gods keep you in awe which else
would feed on one another What's their seeking

for corn at their own rates whereof they say
the city is well stor'd

hang em They say
they'll sit by the fire and presume to know
what's done i' the Capitol who's like to rise
who thrives and who declines side factions and give out
conjectural marriages making parties strong
and feebling such as stand not in their liking
below their cobbled shoes They say there's grain enough
would the nobility lay aside their ruth
and let me use my sword I'd make a quarry
with thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high
as I could pick my lance
nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
for though abundantly they lack discretion
yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you
what says the other troop

they are dissolv'd hang em
they said they were an-hungry sigh'd forth proverbs
that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
corn for the rich men only With these shreds
they vented their complainings which being answer'd
and a petition granted them a strange one
to break the heart of generosity
and make bold power look pale they threw their caps
as they would hang them on the horns o' the moon
shouting their emulation

what is granted them

of their own choice one's Junius Brutus
Sicinius Velutus and I know not Sdeath
the rabble should have first unroof'd the city
ere so prevail'd with me it will in time
win upon power and throw forth greater themes
for insurrection's arguing

this is strange

go get you home you fragments


where's Caius Marcius

here what's the matter

the news is sir the Volsces are in arms

I am glad on't then we shall ha' means to vent


Marcius tis true that you have lately told us
the Volsces are in arms

they have a leader
Tullus Aufidius that will put you to't
I sin in envying his nobility
and were I anything but what I am
I would wish me only he

you have fought together

were half to half the world by the ears and he
upon my party I'd revolt to make
only my wars with him he is a lion
that I am proud to hunt

then worthy Marcius

it is your former promise

sir it is
and I am constant Titus Lartius thou
shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face
what art thou stiff stand'st out

no Caius Marcius
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
ere stay behind this business

O true-bred

your company to the Capitol where I know
our greatest friends attend us

lead you on

follow Cominius we must follow you
right worthy you priority

noble Marcius

hence to your homes be gone

nay let them follow
the Volsces have much corn take these rats thither
to gnaw their garners Worshipful mutiners
your valour puts well forth pray follow


was ever man so proud as is this Marcius

he has no equal

when we were chosen tribunes for the people


nay but his taunts

being mov'd he will not spare to gird the gods

bemock the modest moon

the present wars devour him he is grown
too proud to be so valiant

such a nature
tickled with good success disdains the shadow
which he treads on at noon But I do wonder
his insolence can brook to be commanded
under Cominius

fame at the which he aims
in whom already he is well grac'd cannot
better be held nor more attain'd than by
shall be the general's fault though he perform
to the utmost of a man and giddy censure
will then cry out of Marcius O if he
had borne the business

besides if things go well
opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
of his demerits rob Cominius

come
half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius
though Marcius earn'd them not and all his faults
to Marcius shall be honours though indeed
in aught he merit not

let's hence and hear
how the dispatch is made and in what fashion
more than his singularity he goes
upon this present action
let's along


so your opinion is Aufidius
that they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels
and know how we proceed

is it not yours
what ever have been thought on in this state
that could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
had circumvention Tis not four days gone
since I heard thence these are the words I think
I have the letter here yes here it is
they have press'd a power but it is not known
whether for east or west the dearth is great
the people mutinous and it is rumour'd
Cominius Marcius your old enemy
who is of Rome worse hated than of you
and Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman
whither tis bent most likely tis for you
consider of it

our army's in the field
we never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
to answer us

nor did you think it folly
to keep your great pretences veil'd till when
they needs must show themselves which in the hatching
it seem'd appear'd to Rome By the discovery
we shall be shorten'd in our aim which was
to take in many towns ere almost Rome
should know we were afoot

noble Aufidius
take your commission hie you to your bands
let us alone to guard Corioli
if they set down before's for the remove
they've not prepared for us

O doubt not that
I speak from certainties Nay more
some parcels of their power are forth already
and only hitherward I leave your honours
if we and Caius Marcius chance to meet
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
till one can do no more

the gods assist you

and keep your honours safe

farewell

farewell

farewell

I pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort If my son were my husband I would freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding I considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame To a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak I tell thee daughter I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man

but had he died in the business madam how then

then his good report should have been my son I therein would have found issue Hear me profess sincerely had I a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action


madam the Lady Valeria is come to visit you

beseech you give me leave to retire myself

indeed you shall not
methinks I hear hither your husband's drum
see him pluck Aufidius down by the hair
as children from a bear the Volsces shunning him
methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus
'Come on you cowards you were got in fear
though you were born in Rome His bloody brow
like to a harvestman that's task'd to mow
or all or lose his hire

his bloody brow O Jupiter no blood

away you fool it more becomes a man
than gilt his trophy the breasts of Hecuba
when she did suckle Hector look'd not lovelier
than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
at Grecian swords contemning Tell Valeria
we are fit to bid her welcome


heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius

he'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
and tread upon his neck



sweet madam

I am glad to see your ladyship

how do you both you are manifest housekeepers What are you sewing here A fine spot in good faith How does your little son

I thank your ladyship well good madam

he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster

o' my word the father's son I'll swear tis a very pretty boy O' my troth I looked upon him o' Wednesday half an hour together he has such a confirmed countenance I saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes and up again catched it again or whether his fall enraged him or how twas he did so set his teeth and tear it O I warrant how he mammocked it

one on's father's moods

indeed la tis a noble child

a crack madam


no good madam I will not out of doors

not out of doors

she shall she shall

indeed no by your patience I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars

fie you confine yourself most unreasonably Come you must go visit the good lady that lies in

I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers but I cannot go thither

why I pray you

'Tis not to save labour nor that I want love

you would be another Penelope yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths Come I would your cambric were sensible as your finger that you might leave pricking it for pity Come you shall go with us


in truth la go with me and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband

O good madam there can be none yet

verily I do not jest with you there came news from him last night

indeed madam

in earnest it's true I heard a senator speak it Thus it is The Volsces have an army forth against whom Cominius the general is gone with one part of our Roman power your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars This is true on mine honour and so I pray go with us

give me excuse good madam I will obey you in every thing hereafter

let her alone lady as she is now she will but disease our better mirth

in troth I think she would Fare you well then Come good sweet lady Prithee Virgilia turn thy solemness out o' door and go along with us

no at a word madam indeed I must not I wish you much mirth



yonder comes news a wager they have met

my horse to yours no

'Tis done

agreed

say has our general met the enemy

they lie in view but have not spoke as yet

so the good horse is mine

I'll buy him of you

no I'll nor sell nor give him lend you him I will

how far off lie these armies

within this mile and half

then shall we hear their larum and they ours
now Mars I prithee make us quick in work
that we with smoking swords may march from hence
to help our fielded friends Come blow thy blast

Tullus Aufidius is he within your walls

no nor a man that fears you less than he
that's lesser than a little Hark our drums

are bringing forth our youth we'll break our walls
rather than they shall pound us up our gates
which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes
they'll open of themselves Hark you far off
there is Aufidius list what work he makes
amongst your cloven army

O they are at it

their noise be our instruction Ladders ho


they fear us not but issue forth their city
now put your shields before your hearts and fight
with hearts more proof than shields Advance brave Titus
they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
which makes me sweat with wrath Come on my fellows
he that retires I'll take him for a Volsce
and he shall feel mine edge


all the contagion of the south light on you
you shames of Rome you herd of Boils and plagues
further than seen and one infect another
against the wind a mile You souls of geese
that bear the shapes of men how have you run
from slaves that apes would beat Pluto and hell
all hurt behind backs red and faces pale
with flight and agu'd fear Mend and charge home
or by the fires of heaven I'll leave the foe
and make my wars on you look to t come on
if you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives
as they us to our trenches follow'd


so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds
'Tis for the followers Fortune widens them
not for the fliers mark me and do the like


foolhardiness not I



see they have shut him in

to the pot I warrant him

what is become of Marcius

slain sir doubtless

following the fliers at the very heels
with them he enters who upon the sudden
clapp'd-to their gates he is himself alone
to answer all the city

O noble fellow
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
and when it bows stands up Thou art left Marcius
a carbuncle entire as big as thou art
even to Cato's wish not fierce and terrible
only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
the thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
thou mad'st thine enemies shake as if the world
were feverous and did tremble


look sir

O tis Marcius
let's fetch him off or make remain alike


this will I carry to Rome

and I this

a murrain on't I took this for silver

at a crack'd drachme Cushions leaden spoons
irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
bury with those that wore them these base slaves
ere yet the fight be done pack up Down with them
and hark what noise the general makes To him
there is the man of my soul's hate Aufidius
piercing our Romans then valiant Titus take
convenient numbers to make good the city
whilst I with those that have the spirit will haste
to help Cominius

worthy sir thou bleed'st
thy exercise hath been too violent
for a second course of fight

sir praise me not
my work hath yet not warm'd me fare you well
the blood I drop is rather physical
than dangerous to me to Aufidius thus

now the fair goddess Fortune
fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
misguide thy opposers' swords Bold gentleman
prosperity be thy page

thy friend no less
than those she places highest So farewell

thou worthiest Marcius

go sound thy trumpet in the market-place
call thither all the officers of the town
where they shall know our mind Away


breathe you my friends well fought we are come off
like Romans neither foolish in our stands
nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs
by interims and conveying gusts we have heard
the charges of our friends Ye Roman gods
lead their successes as we wish our own
that both our powers with smiling fronts encountering
may give you thankful sacrifice

thy news

the citizens of Corioli have issu'd
and given to Lartius and to Marcius battle
I saw our party to their trenches driven
and then I came away

though thou speak'st truth
methinks thou speak'st not well How long is't since

above an hour my lord

'Tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums
and bring thy news so late

spies of the Volsces
held me in chase that I was forc'd to wheel
three or four miles about else had I sir
half an hour since brought my report

who's yonder
that does appear as he were flay'd O gods
he has the stamp of Marcius and I have
before-time seen him thus

come I too late

the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
more than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
from every meaner man



ay if you come not in the blood of others
but mantled in your own

O let me clip ye
in arms as sound as when I woo'd in heart
as merry as when our nuptial day was done
and tapers burn'd to bedward

flower of warriors
how is't with Titus Lartius

as with a man busied about decrees
condemning some to death and some to exile
ransoming him or pitying threat'ning the other
holding Corioli in the name of Rome
even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
to let him slip at will

which told me they had beat you to your trenches
where is he Call him hither

let him alone
he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen
the common file a plague tribunes for them
the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
from rascals worse than they

but how prevail'd you

will the time serve to tell I do not think
where is the enemy Are you lords o' the field
if not why cease you till you are so

Marcius we have at disadvantage fought
and did retire to win our purpose

how lies their battle Know you on which side

as I guess Marcius
their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates
of their best trust o'er them Aufidius
their very heart of hope

I do beseech you
by all the battles wherein we have fought
by the blood we have shed together by the vows
we have made to endure friends that you directly
set me against Aufidius and his Antiates
and that you not delay the present but
filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts
we prove this very hour

though I could wish
you were conducted to a gentle bath
and balms applied to you yet dare I never
deny your asking take your choice of those

those are they
that most are willing If any such be here
as it were sin to doubt that love this painting
wherein you see me smear'd if any fear
lesser his person than an ill report
if any think brave death outweighs bad life
and that his country's dearer than himself
let him alone or so many so minded
wave thus to express his disposition
and follow Marcius

O me alone Make you a sword of me
if these shows be not outward which of you
but is four Volsces None of you but is
able to bear against the great Aufidius
a shield as hard as his A certain number
though thanks to all must I select from all the rest
shall bear the business in some other fight
and four shall quickly draw out my command
which men are best inclin'd

march on my fellows
make good this ostentation and you shall
divide in all with us


so let the ports be guarded keep your duties
as I have set them down If I do send dispatch
those centuries to our aid the rest will serve
for a short holding if we lose the field
we cannot keep the town

fear not our care sir

hence and shut your gates upon us
our guider come to the Roman camp conduct us

I'll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee
worse than a promise-breaker

we hate alike
not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
more than thy fame and envy Fix thy foot

let the first budger die the other's slave
and the gods doom him after

if I fly Marcius
halloo me like a hare

within these three hours Tullus
alone I fought in your Corioli walls
and made what work I pleas'd tis not my blood
wherein thou seest me mask'd for thy revenge
wrench up thy power to the highest

that was the whip of your bragg'd progeny
thou shouldst not scape me here

officious and not valiant you have sham'd me
in your condemned seconds


if I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work
thou'lt not believe thy deeds but I'll report it
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
where great patricians shall attend and shrug
i' the end admire where ladies shall be frighted
and gladly quak'd hear more where the dull Tribunes
that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
shall say against their hearts
'We thank the gods our Rome hath such a soldier
yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast
having fully din'd before

O general
here is the steed we the caparison
hadst thou beheld

pray now no more my mother
who has a charter to extol her blood
when she does praise me grieves me I have done
as you have done that's what I can induc'd
as you have been that's for my country
he that has but effected his good will
hath overta'en mine act

you shall not be
the grave of your deserving Rome must know
the value of her own twere a concealment
worse than a theft no less than a traducement
to hide your doings and to silence that
which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd
would seem but modest Therefore I beseech you
what you have done before our army hear me

I have some wounds upon me and they smart
to hear themselves remember'd

should they not
well might they fester gainst ingratitude
and tent themselves with death Of all the horses
whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all
the treasure in this field achiev'd and city
we render you the tenth to be ta'en forth
before the common distribution
at your only choice

I thank you general
but cannot make my heart consent to take
a bribe to pay my sword I do refuse it
and stand upon my common part with those
that have beheld the doing
may these same instruments which you profane
never sound more When drums and trumpets shall
i' the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
made all of false-fac'd soothing
when steel grows soft as is the parasite's silk
let him be made a coverture for the wars
no more I say For that I have not wash'd
my nose that bled or foil'd some debile wretch
which without note here's many else have done
you shout me forth
in acclamations hyperbolical
as if I lov'd my little should be dieted
in praises sauc'd with lies

too modest are you
more cruel to your good report than grateful
to us that give you truly By your patience
if gainst yourself you be incens'd we'll put you
like one that means his proper harm in manacles
as to us to all the world that Caius Marcius
wears this war's garland in token of the which
my noble steed known to the camp I give him
with all his trim belonging and from this time
for what he did before Corioli call him
with all the applause and clamour of the host
the addition nobly ever

Caius Marcius Coriolanus


I will go wash
and when my face is fair you shall perceive
whether I blush or no howbeit I thank you
I mean to stride your steed and at all times
to undercrest your good addition
to the fairness of my power

so to our tent
to Rome of our success You Titus Lartius
must to Corioli back send us to Rome
the best with whom we may articulate
for their own good and ours

I shall my lord

the gods begin to mock me I that now
refus'd most princely gifts am bound to beg
of my lord general

take it tis yours What is't

I sometime lay here in Corioli
at a poor man's house he us'd me kindly
he cried to me I saw him prisoner
but then Aufidius was within my view
and wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity I request you
to give my poor host freedom
O well begg'd
were he the butcher of my son he should
be free as is the wind Deliver him Titus

Marcius his name

by Jupiter forgot
I am weary yea my memory is tir'd
have we no wine here

go we to our tent
the blood upon your visage dries tis time
it should be look'd to come

the town is ta'en

'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition

condition
being a Volsce be that I am Condition
what good condition can a treaty find
i' the part that is at mercy Five times Marcius
I have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me
and wouldst do so I think should we encounter
as often as we eat By the elements
if e'er again I meet him beard to beard
he is mine or I am his mine emulation
hath not that honour in't it had for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force
true sword to sword I'll potch at him some way
or wrath or craft may get him

he's the devil

bolder though not so subtle My valour's poison'd
with only suffering stain by him for him
shall fly out of itself Nor sleep nor sanctuary
being naked sick nor fane nor Capitol
embarquements all of fury shall lift up
their rotten privilege and custom gainst
my hate to Marcius Where I find him were it
at home upon my brother's guard even there
against the hospitable canon would I
wash my fierce hand in s heart Go you to the city
learn how tis held and what they are that must
be hostages for Rome

will not you go

I am attended at the cypress grove I pray you
'Tis south the city mills bring me word thither
how the world goes that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey

I shall sir

the augurer tells me we shall have news to-night
good or bad

not according to the prayer of the people for they love not Marcius

nature teaches beasts to know their friends

pray you who does the wolf love

the lamb

ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius

he's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear

he's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb You two are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you

well sir

well sir
in what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance

he's poor in no one fault but stored with all

especially in pride

and topping all others in boasting

this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city I mean of us o' the right hand file Do you

why how are we censured

because you talk of pride now Will you not be angry

well well sir well

why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame Marcius for being proud

we do it not alone sir
I know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone You talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O that you could

what then sir

why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in Rome

Menenius you are known well enough too

I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath Meeting two such wealsmen as you are I cannot call you Lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces If you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough too

come sir come we know you well enough

you know neither me yourselves nor anything You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller and then rejourn the controversy of three-pence to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber-pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves You are a pair of strange ones

come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol

our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen Good den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you



honourable Menenius my boy Marcius approaches for the love of Juno let's go

ha Marcius coming home

ay worthy Menenius and with most prosperous approbation

take my cap Jupiter and I thank thee Hoo Marcius coming home

nay tis true

nay tis true

look here's a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and I think there's one at home for you

I will make my very house reel to-night A letter for me

yes certain there's a letter for you I saw it


O no no no

O he is wounded I thank the gods for't

so do I too if it be not too much Brings a' victory in his pocket The wounds become him

on s brows Menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland

has he disciplined Aufidius soundly

Titus Lartius writes they fought together but Aufidius got off

and twas time for him too I'll warrant him that an he had stayed by him I would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them Is the senate possessed of this

good ladies let's go Yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war He hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly

in troth there's wondrous things spoke of him


the gods grant them true

true pow wow

true I'll be sworn they are true Where is he wounded


where is he wounded

i' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' the body

one i' the neck and two i' the thigh there's nine that I know

he had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds upon him

now it's twenty-seven every gash was an enemy's grave

hark the trumpets
these are the ushers of Marcius before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears
death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie
which being advanc'd declines and then men die


know Rome that all alone Marcius did fight
within Corioli gates where he hath won
with fame a name to Caius Marcius these
in honour follows Coriolanus
welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus


welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus

no more of this it does offend my heart
pray now no more

look sir your mother

you have I know petition'd all the gods
for my prosperity


nay my good soldier up
my gentle Marcius worthy Caius and
by deed-achieving honour newly nam'd
what is it Coriolanus must I call thee
but O thy wife

my gracious silence hail
wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home
that weep'st to see me triumph Ah my dear
such eyes the widows in Corioli wear
and mothers that lack sons

now the gods crown thee

and live you yet
O my sweet lady pardon

I know not where to turn O welcome home
and welcome general and ye're welcome all

a hundred thousand welcomes I could weep
and I could laugh I am light and heavy Welcome
a curse begnaw at very root on s heart
that is not glad to see thee You are three
that Rome should dote on yet by the faith of men
we have some old crab-trees here at home that will not
be grafted to your relish Yet welcome warriors
we call a nettle but a nettle and
the faults of fools but folly

ever right

Menenius ever ever


your hand and yours
ere in our own house I do shade my head
the good patricians must be visited
from whom I have receiv'd not only greetings
but with them change of honours

I have liv'd
to see inherited my very wishes
and the buildings of my fancy only
there's one thing wanting which I doubt not but
our Rome will cast upon thee

know good mother
I had rather be their servant in my way
than sway with them in theirs

on to the Capitol

all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse
into a rapture lets her baby cry
while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
her richest lockram bout her reechy neck
clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows
are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
with variable complexions all agreeing
in earnestness to see him seld-shown flamens
do press among the popular throngs and puff
to win a vulgar station our veil'd dames
commit the war of white and damask in
their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
of Ph bus' burning kisses such a pother
as if that whatsoever god who leads him
were slily crept into his human powers
and gave him graceful posture

on the sudden

then our office may
during his power go sleep

he cannot temperately transport his honours
from where he should begin and end but will
lose those he hath won

in that there's comfort

doubt not the commoners for whom we stand
but they upon their ancient malice will
forget with the least cause these his new honours
which that he'll give them make I as little question
as he is proud to do't

I heard him swear
were he to stand for consul never would he
appear i' the market-place nor on him put
nor showing as the manner is his wounds
to the people beg their stinking breaths

'Tis right

it was his word O he would miss it rather
than carry it but by the suit o' the gentry to him
and the desire of the nobles

I wish no better
than have him hold that purpose and to put it
in execution

'Tis most like he will

it shall be to him then as our good wills
a sure destruction

so it must fall out
we must suggest the people in what hatred
he still hath held them that to his power he would
have made them mules silenc'd their pleaders and
dispropertied their freedoms holding them
in human action and capacity
of no more soul nor fitness for the world
than camels in the war who have their provand
only for bearing burdens and sore blows
for sinking under them

this as you say suggested
at some time when his soaring insolence
shall teach the people which time shall not want
if he be put upon t and that's as easy
as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire
to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
shall darken him for ever



you are sent for to the Capitol Tis thought
that Marcius shall be consul
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves
ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended
as to Jove's statue and the commons made
a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
I never saw the like

let's to the Capitol
and carry with us ears and eyes for the time
but hearts for the event

have with you


come come they are almost here

three they say but tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it

that's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common people

faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't

if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love

he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it

no more of him he is a worthy man make way they are coming

having determin'd of the Volsces and
to send for Titus Lartius it remains
as the main point of this our after-meeting
to gratify his noble service that
hath thus stood for his country therefore please you
most reverend and grave elders to desire
in our well-found successes to report
a little of that worthy work perform'd
by Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom
we meet here both to thank and to remember
with honours like himself

speak good Cominius
leave nothing out for length and make us think
rather our state's defective for requital
than we to stretch it out

masters o' the people
we do request your kindest ears and after
your loving motion toward the common body
to yield what passes here

we are convented
upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
inclinable to honour and advance

which the rather
we shall be bless'd to do if he remember
a kinder value of the people than
he hath hereto priz'd them at

that's off that's off
I would you rather had been silent Please you
to hear Cominius speak

most willingly
but yet my caution was more pertinent
than the rebuke you give it

he loves your people
but tie him not to be their bedfellow
worthy Cominius speak

nay keep your place
sit Coriolanus never shame to hear
what you have nobly done

your honours' pardon
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
than hear say how I got them

sir I hope
my words disbench'd you not

no sir yet oft
when blows have made me stay I fled from words
you sooth'd not therefore hurt not But your people
I love them as they weigh

pray now sit down

I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
when the alarum were struck than idly sit


masters of the people
your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
that's thousand to one good one when you now see
he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
than one on s ears to hear it Proceed Cominius

I shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus
should not be utter'd feebly It is held
that valour is the chiefest virtue and
most dignifies the haver if it be
the man I speak of cannot in the world
be singly counterpois'd At sixteen years
when Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought
beyond the mark of others our then dictator
whom with all praise I point at saw him fight
when with his Amazonian chin he drove
the bristled lips before him He bestrid
slew three opposers Tarquin's self he met
and struck him on his knee in that day's feats
when he might act the woman in the scene
he prov'd best man i' the field and for his meed
was brow-bound with the oak His pupil age
man-enter'd thus he waxed like a sea
and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
he lurch'd all swords of the garland For this last
before and in Corioli let me say
I cannot speak him home he stopp'd the fliers
and by his rare example made the coward
turn terror into sport as weeds before
a vessel under sail so men obey'd
and fell below his stem his sword death's stamp
where it did mark it took from face to foot
he was a thing of blood whose every motion
was tim'd with dying cries alone he enter'd
the mortal gate of the city which he painted
with shunless destiny aidless came off
Corioli like a planet Now all's his
when by and by the din of war gan pierce
his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate
and to the battle came he where he did
run reeking o'er the lives of men as if
'Twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd
both field and city ours he never stood
to ease his breast with panting

worthy man

he cannot but with measure fit the honours
which we devise him

our spoils he kick'd at
and look'd upon things precious as they were
the common muck o' the world he covets less
than misery itself would give rewards
to spend the time to end it

he's right noble
let him be call'd for

call Coriolanus

he doth appear


the senate Coriolanus are well pleas'd
to make thee consul

I do owe them still
my life and services

it then remains
that you do speak to the people

let me o'erleap that custom for I cannot
put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage please you
that I may pass this doing

sir the people
must have their voices neither will they bate
one jot of ceremony

put them not to t
pray you go fit you to the custom and
take to you as your predecessors have
your honour with your form

it is a part
that I shall blush in acting and might well
be taken from the people

mark you that
to brag unto them thus I did and thus
show them the unaching scars which I should hide
as if I had receiv'd them for the hire
of their breath only

do not stand upon't
we recommend to you tribunes of the people
our purpose to them and to our noble consul
wish we all joy and honour

to Coriolanus come all joy and honour


you see how he intends to use the people

may they perceive s intent He will require them
as if he did contemn what he requested
should be in them to give

of our proceedings here on the market-place
I know they do attend us


once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him

we may sir if we will

we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members

and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude

we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' the compass

think you so Which way do you judge my wit would fly

nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's will tis strongly wedged up in a block-head but if it were at liberty twould sure southward

why that way
to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience' sake to help to get thee a wife

you are never without your tricks you may you may

are you all resolved to give your voices But that's no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man

here he comes and in a gown of humility mark his behaviour We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes He's to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and I'll direct you how you shall go by him

content content


O sir you are not right have you not known
the worthiest men have done't

what must I say
'I pray sir Plague upon't I cannot bring
my tongue to such a pace Look sir my wounds
I got them in my country's service when
some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran

O me the gods
you must not speak of that you must desire them
to think upon you

think upon me Hang em
I would they would forget me like the virtues
which our divines lose by em

you'll mar all
I'll leave you Pray you speak to em I pray you
in wholesome manner

bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean

so here comes a brace

you know the cause sir of my standing here
we do sir tell us what hath brought you to t

mine own desert

your own desert

ay not mine own desire

how not your own desire

no sir twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging

you must think if we give you any thing we hope to gain by you

well then I pray your price o' the consulship

the price is to ask it kindly

kindly sir I pray let me ha t I have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private Your good voice sir what say you
you shall ha t worthy sir

a match sir There is in all two worthy voices begged I have your alms adieu

but this is something odd

an twere to give again but tis no matter

pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown

you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly

your enigma

you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people

you should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountifully to the desirers Therefore beseech you I may be consul

we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily
you have received many wounds for your country

I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further

the gods give you joy sir heartily


most sweet voices
better it is to die better to starve
than crave the hire which first we do deserve
why in this woolvish toge should I stand here
to beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
their needless vouches Custom calls me to t
what custom wills in all things should we do t
the dust on antique time would lie unswept
and mountainous error be too highly heap'd
for truth to o'er-peer Rather than fool it so
let the high office and the honour go
to one that would do thus I am half through
here come more voices


your voices for your voices I have fought
watch'd for your voices for your voices bear
of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of for your voices have
done many things some less some more your voices

indeed I would be consul

he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest man's voice

therefore let him be consul The gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people

amen amen
God save thee noble consul




you have stood your limitation and the tribunes
endue you with the people's voice remains
that in the official marks invested you
anon do meet the senate

is this done

the custom of request you have discharg'd
the people do admit you and are summon'd
to meet anon upon your approbation

where at the senate-house

there Coriolanus

may I change these garments


that I'll straight do and knowing myself again
repair to the senate-house

I'll keep you company Will you along

we stay here for the people

fare you well

he has it now and by his looks methinks
'Tis warm at's heart

with a proud heart he wore
his humble weeds Will you dismiss the people


how now my masters have you chose this man


we pray the gods he may deserve your love

amen sir To my poor unworthy notice
he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices

certainly
he flouted us downright

no tis his kind of speech he did not mock us

not one amongst us save yourself but says
he used us scornfully he should have show'd us
his marks of merit wounds receiv'd for's country

why so he did I am sure

no no no man saw em

and with his hat thus waving it in scorn
'I would be consul says he aged custom
but by your voices will not so permit me
your voices therefore when we granted that
here was I thank you for your voices thank you
your most sweet voices now you have left your voices
I have no further with you Was not this mockery

why either were you ignorant to see t
or seeing it of such childish friendliness
to yield your voices

could you not have told him
as you were lesson'd when he had no power
but was a petty servant to the state
he was your enemy ever spake against
your liberties and the charters that you bear
i' the body of the weal and now arriving
a place of potency and sway o' the state
fast foe to the plebeii your voices might
be curses to yourselves You should have said
that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
than what he stood for so his gracious nature
would think upon you for your voices and
translate his malice towards you into love
standing your friendly lord

thus to have said
as you were fore-advis'd had touch'd his spirit
and tried his inclination from him pluck'd
either his gracious promise which you might
as cause had call'd you up have held him to
or else it would have gall'd his surly nature
which easily endures not article
tying him to aught so putting him to rage
you should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
and pass'd him unelected

he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves and do you think
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush Why had your bodies
no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
against the rectorship of judgment

have you
ere now denied the asker and now again
of him that did not ask but mock bestow
your su'd-for tongues

he's not confirm'd we may deny him yet

and will deny him
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound

ay twice five hundred and their friends to piece em

they have chose a consul that will from them take
their liberties make them of no more voice
than dogs that are as often beat for barking
as therefore kept to do so

let them assemble
and on a safer judgment all revoke
your ignorant election Enforce his pride
and his old hate unto you besides forget not
with what contempt he wore the humble weed
how in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves
thinking upon his services took from you
the apprehension of his present portance
which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
after the inveterate hate he bears you

lay
a fault on us your tribunes that we labour'd
no impediment between but that you must

say you chose him
more after our commandment than as guided
by your own true affections and that your minds
pre-occupied with what you rather must do
than what you should made you against the grain
to voice him consul lay the fault on us

ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you
how youngly he began to serve his country
how long continu'd and what stock he springs of
the noble house o' the Marcians from whence came
that Ancus Marcius Numa's daughter's son
who after great Hostilius here was king
of the same house Publius and Quintus were
that our best water brought by conduits hither
and Censorinus that was so surnam'd
and nobly nam'd so twice being censor
was his great ancestor
one thus descended
that hath beside well in his person wrought
to be set high in place we did commend
to your remembrances but you have found
scaling his present bearing with his past
that he's your fixed enemy and revoke
your sudden approbation

say you ne'er had done t
harp on that still but by our putting on
and presently when you have drawn your number
repair to the Capitol

we will so almost all
repent in their election


let them go on
this mutiny were better put in hazard
if as his nature is he fall in rage
with their refusal both observe and answer
the vantage of his anger

to the Capitol come
we will be there before the stream o' the people
and this shall seem as partly tis their own
which we have goaded onward

Tullus Aufidius then had made new head

he had my lord and that it was which caus'd
our swifter composition

so then the Volsces stand but as at first
ready when time shall prompt them to make road
upon s again

they are worn lord consul so
their banners wave again

saw you Aufidius

on safe-guard he came to me and did curse
against the Volsces for they had so vilely
yielded the town he is retir'd to Antium

spoke he of me

he did my lord

how what

how often he had met you sword to sword
that of all things upon the earth he hated
your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
to hopeless restitution so he might
be call'd your vanquisher
at Antium lives he

at Antium

I wish I had a cause to seek him there
to oppose his hatred fully Welcome home


behold these are the tribunes of the people
the tongues o' the common mouth I do despise them
for they do prank them in authority

against all noble sufferance

pass no further

ha what is that

it will be dangerous to go on no further
what makes this change

the matter

hath he not pass'd the noble and the common

Cominius no

have I had children's voices

tribunes give way he shall to the market-place

the people are incens'd against him

stop
or all will fall in broil

are these your herd
must these have voices that can yield them now
you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
have you not set them on

be calm be calm

it is a purpos'd thing and grows by plot
to curb the will of the nobility
suffer't and live with such as cannot rule
nor ever will be rul'd

call't not a plot
the people cry you mock'd them and of late
when corn was given them gratis you repin'd
scandall'd the suppliants for the people call'd them
time-pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness

why this was known before

not to them all
have you inform'd them sithence

how I inform them

you are like to do such business

not unlike
each way to better yours

why then should I be consul By yond clouds
let me deserve so ill as you and make me
your fellow tribune

you show too much of that
for which the people stir if you will pass
to where you are bound you must inquire your way
which you are out of with a gentler spirit
or never be so noble as a consul
nor yoke with him for tribune
let's be calm

the people are abus'd set on This paltering
becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus
deserv'd this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely
i' the plain way of his merit

tell me of corn
this was my speech and I will speak't again

not now not now

not in this heat sir now

now as I live I will My nobler friends
I crave their pardons
for the mutable rank-scented many let them
regard me as I do not flatter and
therein behold themselves I say again
the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd
by mingling them with us the honour'd number
who lack'd not virtue no nor power but that
which they have given to beggars

well no more

no more words we beseech you

how no more
as for my country I have shed my blood
not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
coin words till they decay against those measles
which we disdain should tetter us yet sought
the very way to catch them

you speak o' the people
as if you were a god to punish not

'Twere well
we let the people know't

what what his choler

choler
were I as patient as the midnight sleep
by Jove twould be my mind

it is a mind
that shall remain a poison where it is
not poison any further

shall remain
hear you this Triton of the minnows mark you
his absolute shall

'Twas from the canon
'Shall
O good but most unwise patricians why
you grave but reckless senators have you thus
given Hydra here to choose an officer
that with his peremptory shall being but
the horn and noise o' the monster's wants not spirit
to say he'll turn your current in a ditch
and make your channel his If he have power
then vail your ignorance if none awake
your dangerous lenity If you are learned
be not as common fools if you are not
let them have cushions by you You are plebeians
if they be senators and they are no less
when both your voices blended the great'st taste
most palates theirs They choose their magistrate
and such a one as he who puts his shall
his popular shall against a graver bench
than ever frown'd in Greece By Jove himself
it makes the consuls base and my soul aches
neither supreme how soon confusion
may enter twixt the gap of both and take
the one by the other

well on to the market-place

whoever gave that counsel to give forth
the corn o' the store-house gratis as twas us'd
sometime in Greece

well well no more of that

though there the people had more absolute power
I say they nourish'd disobedience fed
the ruin of the state

why shall the people give
one that speaks thus their voice

more worthier than their voices They know the corn
was not our recompense resting well assur'd
they ne'er did service for t Being press'd to the war
even when the navel of the state was touch'd
they would not thread the gates this kind of service
did not deserve corn gratis Being i' the war
their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd
most valour spoke not for them The accusation
which they have often made against the senate
all cause unborn could never be the motive
of our so frank donation Well what then
how shall this bisson multitude digest
the senate's courtesy Let deeds express
what's like to be their words We did request it
we are the greater poll and in true fear
they gave us our demands Thus we debase
the nature of our seats and make the rabble
call our cares fears which will in time break ope
the locks o' the senate and bring in the crows

come enough

enough with over-measure

no take more
what may be sworn by both divine and human
seal what I end withal This double worship
where one part does disdain with cause the other
insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
cannot conclude but by the yea and no
of general ignorance it must omit
real necessities and give way the while
to unstable slightness purpose so barr'd it follows
nothing is done to purpose Therefore beseech you
you that will be less fearful than discreet
that love the fundamental part of state
more than you doubt the change on t that prefer
a noble life before a long and wish
that's sure of death without it at once pluck out
the multitudinous tongue let them not lick
the sweet which is their poison Your dishonour
mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
of that integrity which should become it
not having the power to do the good it would
for the ill which doth control t

he has said enough

he has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
as traitors do

thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee
what should the people do with these bald tribunes
on whom depending their obedience fails
to the greater bench In a rebellion
when what's not meet but what must be was law
then were they chosen in a better hour
and throw their power i' the dust

manifest treason

this a consul no

the diles ho Let him be apprehended


go call the people

in whose name myself
attach thee as a traitorous innovator
a foe to the public weal obey I charge thee
and follow to thine answer

hence old goat

we'll surety him
aged sir hands off

hence rotten thing or I shall shake thy bones
out of thy garments

help ye citizens


on both sides more respect

here's he that would take from you all your power

seize him diles

down with him down with him

weapons weapons weapons

what is about to be I am out of breath
to the people Coriolanus patience
speak good Sicinius

hear me people peace

let's hear our tribune Peace Speak speak speak

you are at point to lose your liberties
Marcius would have all from you Marcius
whom late you have nam'd for consul

fie fie fie
this is the way to kindle not to quench

to unbuild the city and to lay all flat

what is the city but the people

true

by the consent of all we were establish'd
the people's magistrates

you so remain

and so are like to do

that is the way to lay the city flat
to bring the roof to the foundation
and bury all which yet distinctly ranges
in heaps and piles of ruin

this deserves death

or let us stand to our authority
or let us lose it We do here pronounce
upon the part o' the people in whose power
we were elected theirs Marcius is worthy

therefore lay hold of him
bear him to the rock Tarpeian and from thence
into destruction cast him

diles seize him

yield Marcius yield

hear me one word
beseech you tribunes hear me but a word

peace peace

be that you seem truly your country's friends
and temperately proceed to what you would
thus violently redress

sir those cold ways
where the disease is violent Lay hands upon him
and bear him to the rock

no I'll die here

there's some among you have beheld me fighting
come try upon yourselves what you have seen me

down with that sword Tribunes withdraw awhile

lay hands upon him

help Marcius help
you that be noble help him young and old

down with him down with him


go get you to your house be gone away

get you gone

stand fast
we have as many friends as enemies

shall it be put to that

the gods forbid
I prithee noble friend home to thy house
leave us to cure this cause

for tis a sore upon us
you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you

come sir along with us

I would they were barbarians as they are
though in Rome litter'd not Romans as they are not

be gone
put not your worthy rage into your tongue
one time will owe another

on fair ground
I could beat forty of them

I could myself
take up a brace o' the best of them yea the two tribunes

but now tis odds beyond arithmetic
and manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
against a falling fabric Will you hence
before the tag return whose rage doth rend
like interrupted waters and o'erbear
what they are us'd to bear

pray you be gone
with those that have but little this must be patch'd
with cloth of any colour

nay come away


this man has marr'd his fortune

his nature is too noble for the world
he would not flatter Neptune for his trident
or Jove for s power to thunder His heart's his mouth
what his breast forges that his tongue must vent
and being angry does forget that ever
he heard the name of death

here's goodly work

I would they were a-bed

could he not speak em fair


where is this viper
that would depopulate the city and
be every man himself

you worthy tribunes

he shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
with rigorous hands he hath resisted law
and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
than the severity of the public power
which he so sets at nought

he shall well know
the noble tribunes are the people's mouths
and we their hands


sir sir

peace

do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
with modest warrant

sir how comes t that you
have holp to make this rescue

hear me speak
as I do know the consul's worthiness
so can I name his faults

consul what consul

the Consul Coriolanus


no no no no no

if by the tribunes' leave and yours good people
I may be heard I would crave a word or two
the which shall turn you to no further harm
than so much loss of time

speak briefly then
for we are peremptory to dispatch
this viperous traitor To eject him hence
were but one danger and to keep him here
our certain death therefore it is decreed
he dies to-night

now the good gods forbid
that our renowned Rome whose gratitude
towards her deserved children is enroll'd
in Jove's own book like an unnatural dam

he's a disease that must be cut away

O he's a limb that has but a disease
mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
what has he done to Rome that's worthy death
killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
by many an ounce he dropp'd it for his country
and what is left to lose it by his country
were to us all that do't and suffer it
a brand to th' end o' the world

this is clean kam

merely awry when he did love his country
it honour'd him

the service of the foot
for what before it was

we'll hear no more
pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
lest his infection being of catching nature
spread further

one word more one word
this tiger-footed rage when it shall find
the harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late
tie leaden pounds to's heels Proceed by process
lest parties as he is belov'd break out
and sack great Rome with Romans

if twere so

what do ye talk
have we not had a taste of his obedience
our diles smote ourselves resisted Come
consider this he has been bred i' the wars
since he could draw a sword and is ill school'd
in bolted language meal and bran together
he throws without distinction Give me leave
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him
where he shall answer by a lawful form
in peace to his utmost peril

noble tribunes
it is the humane way the other course
will prove too bloody and the end of it
unknown to the beginning

noble Menenius
be you then as the people's officer
masters lay down your weapons

go not home

where if you bring not Marcius we'll proceed
in our first way

I'll bring him to you


let me desire your company He must come
or what is worst will follow

pray you let's to him


let them pull all about mine ears present me
death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels
or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock
that the precipitation might down stretch
below the beam of sight yet will I still
be thus to them


I muse my mother
does not approve me further who was wont
to call them woollen vassals things created
to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
in congregations to yawn be still and wonder
when one but of my ordinance stood up
to speak of peace or war


I talk of you
why did you wish me milder Would you have me
false to my nature Rather say I play

the man I am

O sir sir sir
I would have had you put your power well on
before you had worn it out
let go

you might have been enough the man you are
with striving less to be so lesser had been
the thwarting of your dispositions if
you had not show'd them how you were dispos'd
ere they lack'd power to cross you

let them hang

ay and burn too


come come you have been too rough something too rough
you must return and mend it

there's no remedy
unless by not so doing our good city
cleave in the midst and perish
pray be counsell'd
I have a heart of mettle apt as yours
but yet a brain that leads my use of anger
to better vantage

well said noble woman
before he should thus stoop to the herd but that
the violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
for the whole state I would put mine armour on
which I can scarcely bear

what must I do

return to the tribunes

well what then what then

repent what you have spoke

must I then do't to them

you are too absolute
though therein you can never be too noble
but when extremities speak I have heard you say
honour and policy like unsever'd friends
i' the war do grow together grant that and tell me
in peace what each of them by th' other lose
that they combine not there

tush tush

a good demand

if it be honour in your wars to seem
the same you are not which for your best ends
you adopt your policy how is it less or worse
that it shall hold companionship in peace
with honour as in war since that to both

why force you this

because that now it lies you on to speak
to the people not by your own instruction
nor by the matter which your heart prompts you
but with such words that are but rooted in
your tongue though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosom's truth
now this no more dishonours you at all
than to take in a town with gentle words
which else would put you to your fortune and
the hazard of much blood
I would dissemble with my nature where
my fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
I should do so in honour I am in this
your wife your son these senators the nobles
and you will rather show our general louts
how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em
of what that want might ruin

noble lady
come go with us speak fair you may salve so
not what is dangerous present but the loss
of what is past

I prithee now my son
go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
and thus far having stretch'd it here be with them
thy knee bussing the stones for in such business
action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant
more learned than the ears waving thy head
which often thus correcting thy stout heart
now humble as the ripest mulberry
that will not hold the handling or say to them
thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
were fit for thee to use as they to claim
thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
as thou hast power and person

this but done
even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
for they have pardons being ask'd as free
as words to little purpose

prithee now
go and be rul'd although I know thou hadst rather
follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
than flatter him in a bower Here is Cominius


I have been i' the market-place and sir tis fit
you make strong party or defend yourself
by calmness or by absence all's in anger

only fair speech
I think twill serve if he
can thereto frame his spirit

he must and will
prithee now say you will and go about it

must I go show them my unbarbed sconce
must I with my base tongue give to my noble heart
a lie that it must bear Well I will do't
yet were there but this single plot to lose
this mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it
and throw t against the wind To the market-place
you have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life

come come we'll prompt you

I prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
my praises made thee first a soldier so
thou hast not done before

well I must do t
away my disposition and possess me
some harlot's spirit My throat of war be turn'd
which quired with my drum into a pipe
small as a eunuch or the virgin voice
that babies lulls asleep The smiles of knaves
tent in my cheeks and school-boys' tears take up
the glasses of my sight A beggar's tongue
make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees
who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his
that hath receiv'd an alms I will not do t
lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
and by my body's action teach my mind
a most inherent baseness

at thy choice then
to beg of thee it is my more dishonour
thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death
with as big heart as thou Do as thou list
thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me
but owe thy pride thyself

pray be content
mother I am going to the market-place
chide me no more I'll mountebank their loves
cog their hearts from them and come home belov'd
of all the trades in Rome Look I am going
commend me to my wife I'll return consul
or never trust to what my tongue can do
i' the way of flattery further

do your will


away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself
with accusations as I hear more strong
than are upon you yet

the word is mildly

pray you let us go
let them accuse me by invention I
will answer in mine honour

ay but mildly

well mildly be it then Mildly


in this point charge him home that he affects
tyrannical power if he evade us there
enforce him with his envy to the people
and that the spoil got on the Antiates
was ne'er distributed
what will he come

he's coming

how accompanied

with old Menenius and those senators
that always favour'd him

have you a catalogue
of all the voices that we have procur'd
set down by the poll

I have tis ready

have you collected them by tribes

I have

and when they hear me say It shall be so
i' the right and strength o' the commons be it either
for death for fine or banishment then let them
if I say fine cry fine if death cry death
insisting on the old prerogative
and power i' the truth o' the cause

I shall inform them

and when such time they have begun to cry
let them not cease but with a din confus'd
enforce the present execution
of what we chance to sentence

very well

make them be strong and ready for this hint
when we shall hap to give t them


put him to choler straight He hath been us'd
ever to conquer and to have his worth
of contradiction being once chaf'd he cannot
be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks
what's in his heart and that is there which looks
with us to break his neck

well here he comes


calmly I do beseech you

ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece
will bear the knave by the volume The honour'd gods
keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice
supplied with worthy men plant love among us
throng our large temples with the shows of peace
and not our streets with war
amen amen

a noble wish


draw near ye people

list to your tribunes audience peace I say

first hear me speak

well say Peace ho

shall I be charg'd no further than this present
must all determine here

I do demand
if you submit you to the people's voices
allow their officers and are content
as shall be prov'd upon you

I am content

lo citizens he says he is content
the war-like service he has done consider think
upon the wounds his body bears which show
like graves i' the holy churchyard

scratches with briers
scars to move laughter only

consider further
that when he speaks not like a citizen
you find him like a soldier do not take
his rougher accents for malicious sounds
but as I say such as become a soldier
rather than envy you


what is the matter
that being pass'd for consul with full voice
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
you take it off again

answer to us

say then tis true I ought so

we charge you that you have contriv'd to take
from Rome all season'd office and to wind
yourself into a power tyrannical
for which you are a traitor to the people

how Traitor

nay temperately your promise

call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
in thy hands clutch'd as many millions in
thy lying tongue both numbers I would say
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
as I do pray the gods

mark you this people

to the rock to the rock with him

peace
we need not put new matter to his charge
what you have seen him do and heard him speak
beating your officers cursing yourselves
opposing laws with strokes and here defying
those whose great power must try him even this
so criminal and in such capital kind
deserves the extremest death
but since he hath
serv'd well for Rome

what do you prate of service

I talk of that that know it

you

is this the promise that you made your mother

know I pray you

I'll know no further
let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death
vagabond exile flaying pent to linger
but with a grain a day I would not buy
their mercy at the price of one fair word
nor check my courage for what they can give

for that he has
as much as in him lies from time to time
envied against the people seeking means
to pluck away their power as now at last
given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
of dreaded justice but on the ministers
that do distribute it in the name o' the people
and in the power of us the tribunes we
even from this instant banish him our city
in peril of precipitation
from off the rock Tarpeian never more
to enter our Rome gates i' the people's name
I say it shall be so

it shall be so It shall be so Let him away
he's banish'd and it shall be so

hear me my masters and my common friends
he's sentenc'd no more hearing

let me speak
I have been consul and can show for Rome
her enemies' marks upon me I do love
my country's good with a respect more tender
more holy and profound than mine own life
my dear wife's estimate her womb's increase
and treasure of my loins then if I would
speak that

we know your drift speak what

there's no more to be said but he is banish'd
as enemy to the people and his country
it shall be so

it shall be so it shall be so

as reek o' the rotten fens whose loves I prize
as the dead carcases of unburied men
that do corrupt my air I banish you
and here remain with your uncertainty
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
your enemies with nodding of their plumes
fan you into despair Have the power still
to banish your defenders till at length
your ignorance which finds not till it feels
making but reservation of yourselves
still your own foes deliver you as most
abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows Despising
for you the city thus I turn my back
there is a world elsewhere


the people's enemy is gone is gone



go see him out at gates and follow him
as he hath follow'd you with all despite
give him deserv'd vexation Let a guard
attend us through the city

come come let us see him out at gates come
the gods preserve our noble tribunes Come

come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast
with many heads butts me away Nay mother
where is your ancient courage you were us'd
to say extremity was the trier of spirits
that common chances common men could bear
that when the sea was calm all boats alike
show'd mastership in floating fortune's blows
when most struck home being gentle wounded craves
a noble cunning you were us'd to load me
the heart that conn'd them

O heavens O heavens

nay I prithee woman

now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome
and occupations perish

what what what
I shall be lov'd when I am lack'd Nay mother
resume that spirit when you were wont to say
if you had been the wife of Hercules
six of his labours you'd have done and sav'd
your husband so much sweat Cominius
droop not adieu Farewell my wife my mother
I'll do well yet Thou old and true Menenius
thy tears are salter than a younger man's
and venomous to thine eyes My sometime general
heart-hardening spectacles tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
as tis to laugh at them My mother you wot well
my hazards still have been your solace and
believe t not lightly though I go alone
like to a lonely dragon that his fen
makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen your son
will or exceed the common or be caught
with cautelous baits and practice

my first son
whither wilt thou go Take good Cominius
with thee awhile determine on some course
more than a wild exposture to each chance
that starts i' the way before thee

O the gods

I'll follow thee a month devise with thee
and we of thee so if the time thrust forth
a cause for thy repeal we shall not send
o'er the vast world to seek a single man
and lose advantage which doth ever cool
i' the absence of the needer

fare ye well
thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one
that's yet unbruis'd bring me but out at gate
come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
my friends of noble touch when I am forth
bid me farewell and smile I pray you come
while I remain above the ground you shall
hear from me still and never of me aught
but what is like me formerly

that's worthily
as any ear can hear Come let's not weep
from these old arms and legs by the good gods
I'd with thee every foot

give me thy hand
come


bid them all home he's gone and we'll no further
the nobility are vex'd whom we see have sided
in his behalf

now we have shown our power
let us seem humbler after it is done
than when it was a-doing

bid them home
say their great enemy is gone and they
stand in their ancient strength



here comes his mother

let's not meet her

why

they say she's mad

they have ta'en note of us keep on your way

O you're well met The hoarded plague o' the gods
requite your love

peace peace be not so loud

if that I could for weeping you should hear
nay and you shall hear some
will you be gone

you shall stay too I would I had the power
to say so to my husband

are you mankind

ay fool is that a shame Note but this fool
was not a man my father Hadst thou foxship
to banish him that struck more blows for Rome
than thou hast spoken words

O blessed heavens

more noble blows than ever thou wise words
and for Rome's good I'll tell thee what yet go
nay but thou shalt stay too I would my son
were in Arabia and thy tribe before him
his good sword in his hand
what then

what then
he'd make an end of thy posterity

bastards and all
good man the wounds that he does bear for Rome

come come peace

I would he had continu'd to his country
as he began and not unknit himself
the noble knot he made

I would he had

'I would he had Twas you incens'd the rabble
cats that can judge as fitly of his worth
as I can of those mysteries which heaven

pray let us go

now pray sir get you gone
you have done a brave deed Ere you go hear this
as far as doth the Capitol exceed
the meanest house in Rome so far my son
this lady's husband here this do you see
whom you have banish'd does exceed you all

well well we'll leave you

why stay we to be baited
with one that wants her wits

take my prayers with you

I would the gods had nothing else to do
but to confirm my curses Could I meet em
of what lies heavy to t

you have told them home
and by my troth you have cause You'll sup with me

anger's my meat I sup upon myself
and so shall starve with feeding Come let's go
leave this faint puling and lament as I do
in anger Juno-like Come come come

fie fie fie


I know you well sir and you know me your name I think is Adrian

it is so sir truly I have forget you

I am a Roman and my services are as you are against em know you me yet


the same sir

you had more beard when I last saw you but your favour is well approved by your tongue What's the news in Rome I have a note from the Volscian state to find you out there you have well saved me a day's journey

there hath been in Rome strange insurrections the people against the senators patricians and nobles

hath been Is it ended then Our state thinks not-so they are in a most war-like preparation and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division

the main blaze of it is past but a small thing would make it flame again For the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever This lies glowing I can tell you and is almost mature for the violent breaking out

Coriolanus banished

banished sir

you will be welcome with this intelligence Nicanor

the day serves well for them now I have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fallen out with her husband Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars his great opposer Coriolanus being now in no request of his country


I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from Rome all tending to the good of their adversaries Have you an army ready say you

a most royal one the centurions and their charges distinctly billeted already in the entertainment and to be on foot at an hour's warning

I am joyful to hear of their readiness and am the man I think that shall set them in present action So sir heartily well met and most glad of your company

you take my part from me sir I have the most cause to be glad of yours

well let us go together


a goodly city is this Antium City
'Tis I that made thy widows many an heir
of these fair edifices fore my wars
have I heard groan and drop then know me not
lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
in puny battle slay me


and you

direct me if it be your will
where great Aufidius lies Is he in Antium

he is and feasts the nobles of the state
at his house this night

which is his house beseech you

this here before you

thank you sir Farewell

O world thy slippery turns Friends now fast sworn
whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart
whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise
are still together who twin as twere in love
on a dissension of a doit break out
to bitterest enmity so fellest foes
whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
to take the one the other by some chance
some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends
and interjoin their issues So with me
my birth-place hate I and my love's upon
this enemy town I'll enter if he slay me
he does fair justice if he give me way
I'll do his country service


wine wine wine What service is here I think our fellows are asleep

where's Cotus my master calls for him Cotus

a goodly house the feast smells well but I
appear not like a guest

what would you have friend Whence are you Here's no place for you pray go to the door


I have deserv'd no better entertainment
in being Coriolanus


whence are you sir Has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions Pray get you out

away

'Away Get you away

now thou art troublesome

are you so brave I'll have you talked with anon


what fellow's this
a strange one as ever I looked on
I cannot get him out o' the house prithee call my master to him

what have you to do here fellow Pray you avoid the house

let me but stand I will not hurt your hearth

what are you

a gentleman

a marvellous poor one

true so I am

pray you poor gentleman take up some other station here's no place for you pray you avoid come

follow your function go and batten on cold bits

what you will not Prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here

and I shall


where dwell'st thou

under the canopy

'Under the canopy

ay

where's that

i' the city of kites and crows

'I' the city of kites and crows What an ass it is Then thou dwell'st with daws too


how sir Do you meddle with my master

ay tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress
thou prat'st and prat'st serve with thy trencher Hence

where is this fellow

here sir I'd have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords within

whence com'st thou what wouldst thou Thy name
why speak'st not Speak man what's thy name

if Tullus
not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not
think me for the man I am necessity
commands me name myself

what is thy name

a name unmusical to the Volscians' ears
and harsh in sound to thine

say what's thy name
thou hast a grim appearance and thy face
bears a command in t though thy tackle's torn
thou show'st a noble vessel What's thy name

prepare thy brow to frown Know'st thou me yet

I know thee not Thy name

my name is Caius Marcius who hath done
to thee particularly and to all the Volsces
great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
my surname Coriolanus the painful service
the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
shed for my thankless country are requited
and witness of the malice and displeasure
which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains
the cruelty and envy of the people
permitted by our dastard nobles who
have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest
and suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
whoop'd out of Rome Now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
mistake me not to save my life for if
I had fear'd death of all the men i' the world
I would have voided thee but in mere spite
to be full quit of those my banishers
stand I before thee here Then if thou hast
a heart of wreak in thee that will revenge
thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight
and make my misery serve thy turn so use it
that my revengeful services may prove
as benefits to thee for I will fight
of all the under fiends But if so be
thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes
thou art tir'd then in a word I also am
longer to live most weary and present
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
which not to cut would show thee but a fool
since I have ever follow'd thee with hate
drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast
and cannot live but to thy shame unless
it be to do thee service

O Marcius Marcius
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy If Jupiter
should from yond cloud speak divine things
and say Tis true I'd not believe them more
than thee all noble Marcius Let me twine
mine arms about that body where against
my grained ash a hundred times hath broke
the anvil of my sword and do contest
as hotly and as nobly with thy love
as ever in ambitious strength I did
contend against thy valour Know thou first
I lov'd the maid I married never man
sigh'd truer breath but that I see thee here
thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
than when I first my wedded mistress saw
bestride my threshold Why thou Mars I tell thee
we have a power on foot and I had purpose
once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
or lose mine arm for t Thou hast beat me out
twelve several times and I have nightly since
dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
we have been down together in my sleep
unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat
and wak'd half dead with nothing Worthy Marcius
had we no quarrel else to Rome but that
thou art thence banish'd we would muster all
into the bowels of ungrateful Rome
like a bold flood o'er-bear O come go in
and take our friendly senators by the hands
who now are here taking their leaves of me
who am prepar'd against your territories
though not for Rome itself

you bless me gods

therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
the leading of thine own revenges take
the one half of my commission and set down
as best thou art experienc'd since thou know'st
thy country's strength and weakness thine own ways
whether to knock against the gates of Rome
or rudely visit them in parts remote
to fright them ere destroy But come in
let me commend thee first to those that shall
say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes
yet Marcius that was much Your hand most welcome


here's a strange alteration

by my hand I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him

what an arm he has He turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top

nay I knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought I cannot tell how to term it

he had so looking as it were would I were hanged but I thought there was more in him than I could think

so did I I'll be sworn he is simply the rarest man i' the world

I think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on

who my master


worth six on him

nay not so neither but I take him to be the greater soldier

faith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent

ay and for an assault too


O slaves I can tell you news news you rascals

what what what let's partake

what what what let's partake

I would not be a Roman of all nations I had as lief be a condemned man

wherefore wherefore
wherefore wherefore

why here's he that was wont to thwack our general Caius Marcius

why do you say thwack our general

I do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him

come we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him I have heard him say so himself

he was too hard for him directly to say the truth on t before Corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado

an he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too

but more of thy news

why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars set at upper end o' the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him Our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with s hand and turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse But the bottom of the news is our general is out i' the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table He'll go he says and sowle the porter of Rome gates by the ears he will mow down all before him and leave his passage polled

and he's as like to do t as any man I can imagine
do t he will do t for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he's in directitude

directitude what's that

but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like comes after rain and revel all with him

but when goes this forward

to-morrow to-day presently You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips

why then we shall have a stirring world again This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad-makers

let me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as day does night it's spritely waking audible and full of vent Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men

'Tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds

ay and it makes men hate one another

reason because they then less need one another The wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians They are rising they are rising
in in in in


we hear not of him neither need we fear him
his remedies are tame i' the present peace
and quietness o' the people which before
were in wild hurry Here do we make his friends
blush that the world goes well who rather had
though they themselves did suffer by t behold
dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
our tradesmen singing in their shops and going
about their functions friendly


we stood to t in good time Is this Menenius

'Tis he tis he O he is grown most kind
of late Hail sir


your Coriolanus is not much miss'd
but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand
and so would do were he more angry at it

all's well and might have been much better if
he could have temporiz'd

where is he hear you

nay I hear nothing his mother and his wife
hear nothing from him


the gods preserve you both

good den our neighbours

good den to you all good den to you all
ourselves our wives and children on our knees
are bound to pray for you both

live and thrive

farewell kind neighbours we wish'd Coriolanus
had lov'd you as we did

now the gods keep you

farewell farewell


farewell farewell

this is a happier and more comely time
than when these fellows ran about the streets
crying confusion

a worthy officer i' the war but insolent
o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
self-loving

and affecting one sole throne
without assistance

I think not so

we should by this to all our lamentation
if he had gone forth consul found it so

the gods have well prevented it and Rome
sits safe and still without him


worthy tribunes
there is a slave whom we have put in prison
reports the Volsces with two several powers
and with the deepest malice of the war
destroy what lies before them

'Tis Aufidius
who hearing of our Marcius' banishment
thrusts forth his horns again into the world
which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome
and durst not once peep out

come what talk you of Marcius

go see this rumourer whipp'd It cannot be
the Volsces dare break with us

cannot be
we have record that very well it can
and three examples of the like have been
within my age But reason with the fellow
before you punish him where he heard this
and beat the messenger who bids beware
of what is to be dreaded

tell not me
I know this cannot be

not possible


the nobles in great earnestness are going
all to the senate-house some news is come
that turns their countenances

'Tis this slave
go whip him fore the people's eyes his raising
nothing but his report

yes worthy sir
the slave's report is seconded and more

what more fearful

it is spoke freely out of many mouths
how probable I do not know that Marcius
join'd with Aufidius leads a power gainst Rome
and vows revenge as spacious as between
the young'st and oldest thing

this is most likely

rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
good Marcius home again

the very trick on t

this is unlikely
he and Aufidius can no more atone
than violentest contrariety

you are sent for to the senate
a fearful army led by Caius Marcius
associated with Aufidius rages
upon our territories and have already
o'erborne their way consum'd with fire and took
what lay before them


O you have made good work

what news what news

you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
to melt the city leads upon your pates
to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses

what's the news what's the news

your franchises whereon you stood confin'd
into an auger's bore

pray now your news
you have made fair work I fear me Pray your news
if Marcius should be join'd with Volscians

if
he is their god he leads them like a thing
made by some other deity than Nature
that shapes man better and they follow him
against us brats with no less confidence
than boys pursuing summer butterflies
or butchers killing flies

you have made good work
you and your apron-men you that stood so much
upon the voice of occupation and
the breath of garlic-eaters
he will shake
your Rome about your ears

as Hercules
did shake down mellow fruit You have made fair work

but is this true sir

ay and you'll look pale
before you find it other All the regions
do smilingly revolt and who resist
are mock'd for valiant ignorance
and perish constant fools Who is't can blame him
your enemies and his find something in him

we are all undone unless
the noble man have mercy

who shall ask it
deserve such pity of him as the wolf
does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
should say Be good to Rome they charg'd him even
as those should do that had deserv'd his hate
and therein show'd like enemies

'Tis true
if he were putting to my house the brand
that should consume it I have not the face
to say Beseech you cease You have made fair hands
you and your crafts you have crafted fair

you have brought
a trembling upon Rome such as was never
so incapable of help

say not we brought it

say not we brought it
how Was it we We lov'd him but like beasts
and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
who did hoot him out o' the city

but I fear
they'll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius
the second name of men obeys his points
as if he were his officer desperation
is all the policy strength and defence
that Rome can make against them


here come the clusters
and is Aufidius with him You are they
that made the air unwholesome when you cast
your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
coriolanus' exile Now he's coming
and not a hair upon a soldier's head
which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
and pay you for your voices Tis no matter
if he could burn us all into one coal
we have deserv'd it

faith we hear fearful news

for mine own part
when I said banish him I said twas pity

and so did I

and so did I and to say the truth so did very many of us That we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will

you're goodly things you voices

you have made
good work you and your cry Shall's to the Capitol

O ay what else

go masters get you home be not dismay'd
these are a side that would be glad to have
this true which they so seem to fear Go home
and show no sign of fear

the gods be good to us Come masters let's home I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished him

so did we all But come let's home


I do not like this news

nor I

let's to the Capitol Would half my wealth
would buy this for a lie

pray let us go

do they still fly to the Roman

I do not know what witchcraft's in him but
your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
their talk at table and their thanks at end
and you are darken'd in this action sir
even by your own

I cannot help it now
unless by using means I lame the foot
of our design He bears himself more proudlier
even to my person than I thought he would
when first I did embrace him yet his nature
in that's no changeling and I must excuse
what cannot be amended

yet I wish sir
I mean for your particular you had not
had borne the action of yourself or else
to him had left it solely

I understand thee well and be thou sure
when he shall come to his account he knows not
what I can urge against him Although it seems
and so he thinks and is no less apparent
to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
and shows good husbandry for the Volscian state
fights dragon-like and does achieve as soon
as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
that which shall break his neck or hazard mine
whene'er we come to our account

sir I beseech you think you he'll carry Rome

all places yield to him ere he sits down
and the nobility of Rome are his
the senators and patricians love him too
will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
to expel him thence I think he'll be to Rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by sovereignty of nature First he was
a noble servant to them but he could not
carry his honours even whether twas pride
which out of daily fortune ever taints
the happy man whether defect of judgment
to fail in the disposing of those chances
which he was lord of or whether nature
not to be other than one thing not moving
from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace
even with the same austerity and garb
as he controll'd the war but one of these
as he hath spices of them all not all
for I dare so far free him made him fear'd
so hated and so banish'd but he has a merit
to choke it in the utterance So our virtues
lie in the interpretation of the time
hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
to extol what it hath done
one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
come let's away When Caius Rome is thine
thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine

no I'll not go you hear what he hath said
which was sometime his general who lov'd him
in a most dear particular He call'd me father
but what o' that Go you that banish'd him
a mile before his tent fall down and knee
the way into his mercy Nay if he coy'd
to hear Cominius speak I'll keep at home

he would not seem to know me

do you hear

I urg'd our old acquaintance and the drops
that we have bled together Coriolanus
he would not answer to forbad all names
he was a kind of nothing titleless
till he had forg'd himself a name o' the fire
of burning Rome

why so you have made good work
a pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome
to make coals cheap a noble memory

I minded him how royal twas to pardon
when it was less expected he replied
it was a bare petition of a state
to one whom they had punish'd

very well
could he say less

for's private friends his answer to me was
he could not stay to pick them in a pile
of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly
for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
and still to nose the offence

for one poor grain or two
I am one of those his mother wife his child
and this brave fellow too we are the grains
you are the musty chaff and you are smelt
above the moon We must be burnt for you

nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
in this so-never-needed help yet do not
upbraid's with our distress But sure if you
would be your country's pleader your good tongue
more than the instant army we can make
might stop our countryman


pray you go to him

what should I do

only make trial what your love can do
for Rome towards Marcius

well and say that Marcius
return me as Cominius is return'd
unheard what then
but as a discontented friend grief-shot
with his unkindness say t be so

yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
as you intended well

I'll undertake it
and hum at good Cominius much unhearts me
he was not taken well he had not din'd
the veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then
we pout upon the morning are unapt
to give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd
these pipes and these conveyances of our blood
with wine and feeding we have suppler souls
than in our priest-like fasts therefore I'll watch him
till he be dieted to my request
and then I'll set upon him

you know the very road into his kindness
and cannot lose your way

good faith I'll prove him
speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge
of my success



not

I tell you he does sit in gold his eye
red as twould burn Rome and his injury
the gaoler to his pity I kneel'd before him
'Twas very faintly he said Rise dismiss'd me
thus with his speechless hand what he would do
he sent in writing after me what he would not
bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
so that all hope is vain
unless his noble mother and his wife
who as I hear mean to solicit him
for mercy to his country Therefore let's hence
and with our fair entreaties haste them on


stay whence are you


you guard like men tis well but by your leave
I am an officer of state and come
to speak with Coriolanus

from whence

from Rome

you may not pass you must return our general
will no more hear from thence

you'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before
you'll speak with Coriolanus

good my friends
if you have heard your general talk of Rome
and of his friends there it is lots to blanks
my name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius
be it so go back the virtue of your name
is not here passable

I tell thee fellow
thy general is my lover I have been
the book of his good acts whence men have read
his fame unparallel'd haply amplified
for I have ever glorified my friends
of whom he's chief with all the size that verity
would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes
like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
have almost stamp'd the leasing Therefore fellow
I must have leave to pass

faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely Therefore go back

prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius always factionary on the party of your general


has he dined canst thou tell for I would not speak with him till after dinner

you are a Roman are you

I am as thy general is

then you should hate Rome as he does Can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this No you are deceived therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon

sirrah if thy captain know I were here he would use me with estimation

come my captain knows you not

I mean thy general

my general cares not for you
back I say go lest I let forth your half-pint of blood back that's the utmost of your having back

nay but fellow fellow

what's the matter

now you companion I'll say an errand for you you shall know now that I am in estimation you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i' the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swound for what's to come upon thee

the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does O my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen The good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee

away

how away

wife mother child I know not My affairs
are servanted to others though I owe
my revenge properly my remission lies
in Volscian breasts That we have been familiar
ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
than pity note how much Therefore be gone
mine ears against your suits are stronger than
your gates against my force Yet for I lov'd thee

and would have sent it Another word Menenius
I will not hear thee speak This man Aufidius
was my belov'd in Rome yet thou behold'st

you keep a constant temper


now sir is your name Menenius

'Tis a spell you see of much power You know the way home again

do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back

what cause do you think I have to swound

I neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you I can scarce think there's any ye're so slight He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another Let your general do his worst For you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age I say to you as I was said to Away



the worthy fellow is our general he is the rock the oak not to be wind-shaken


we will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
set down our host My partner in this action
you must report to the Volscian lords how plainly
I have borne this business

only their ends
you have respected stopp'd your ears against
the general suit of Rome never admitted
a private whisper no not with such friends
that thought them sure of you

this last old man
whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome
lov'd me above the measure of a father
nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge
though I show'd sourly to him once more offer'd
the first conditions which they did refuse
and cannot now accept to grace him only
that thought he could do more A very little
I have yielded to fresh embassies and suits
nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
will I lend ear to

ha what shout is this
shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
in the same time tis made I will not


my wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould
wherein this trunk was fram'd and in her hand
the grandchild to her blood But out affection
all bond and privilege of nature break
let it be virtuous to be obstinate
what is that curtsy worth or those doves' eyes
of stronger earth than others My mother bows
as if Olympus to a molehill should
in supplication nod and my young boy
hath an aspect of intercession which
great nature cries Deny not Let the Volsces
plough Rome and harrow Italy I'll never
be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
as if a man were author of himself

and knew no other kin

my lord and husband

these eyes are not the same I wore in Rome

the sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd
makes you think so

like a dull actor now
even to a full disgrace Best of my flesh
forgive my tyranny but do not say
for that Forgive our Romans O a kiss
long as my exile sweet as my revenge
now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
I carried from thee dear and my true lip
hath virgin'd it e'er since You gods I prate
and the most noble mother of the world
leave unsaluted Sink my knee i' the earth

of thy deep duty more impression show
than that of common sons

O stand up bless'd
whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
I kneel before thee and unproperly
show duty as mistaken all this while
between the child and parent

what is this
your knees to me to your corrected son
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun
murd'ring impossibility to make
what cannot be slight work

thou art my warrior
I holp to frame thee Do you know this lady

the noble sister of Publicola
the moon of Rome chaste as the icicle
that's curdied by the frost from purest snow
and hangs on Dian's temple dear Valeria

this is a poor epitome of yours

which by the interpretation of full time

the god of soldiers
with the consent of supreme Jove inform
thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
to shame unvulnerable and stick i' the wars
like a great sea-mark standing every flaw
and saving those that eye thee

your knee sirrah

that's my brave boy

even he your wife this lady and myself
are suitors to you

I beseech you peace
or if you'd ask remember this before
the things I have forsworn to grant may never
be held by you denials Do not bid me
again with Rome's mechanics tell me not
wherein I seem unnatural desire not
to allay my rages and revenges with
your colder reasons

O no more no more
you have said you will not grant us any thing
for we have nothing else to ask but that
which you deny already yet we will ask
that if you fail in our request the blame
may hang upon your hardness Therefore hear us

Aufidius and you Volsces mark for we'll
hear nought from Rome in private Your request

should we be silent and not speak our raiment
and state of bodies would bewray what life
we have led since thy exile Think with thyself
how more unfortunate than all living women
make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts
constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
making the mother wife and child to see
the son the husband and the father tearing
his country's bowels out And to poor we
thine enmity's most capital thou barr'st us
our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
that all but we enjoy for how can we
alas how can we for our country pray
whereto we are bound together with thy victory
whereto we are bound Alack or we must lose
the country our dear nurse or else thy person
our comfort in the country We must find
an evident calamity though we had
our wish which side should win for either thou
must as a foreign recreant be led
with manacles through our streets or else
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin
and bear the palm for having bravely shed
I purpose not to wait on Fortune till
these wars determine if I cannot persuade thee
rather to show a noble grace to both parts
than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
march to assault thy country than to tread
trust to't thou shalt not on thy mother's womb
that brought thee to this world

ay and mine
that brought you forth this boy to keep your name
living to time

a' shall not tread on me
I'll run away till I am bigger but then I'll fight

not of a woman's tenderness to be
requires nor child nor woman's face to see
I have sat too long

nay go not from us thus
if it were so that our request did tend
to save the Romans thereby to destroy
the Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
as poisonous of your honour no our suit
is that you reconcile them while the Volsces
may say This mercy we have show'd the Romans
'This we receiv'd and each in either side
give the all-hail to thee and cry Be bless'd
for making up this peace Thou know'st great son
the end of war's uncertain but this certain
that if thou conquer Rome the benefit
which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses
whose chronicle thus writ The man was noble
but with his last attempt he wip'd it out
destroy'd his country and his name remains
to the ensuing age abhorr'd Speak to me son
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air
and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
that should but rive an oak Why dost not speak
think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
still to remember wrongs Daughter speak you
he cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy
perhaps thy childishness will move him more
than can our reasons There is no man in the world
more bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate
like one i' the stocks Thou hast never in thy life
show'd thy dear mother any courtesy
when she poor hen fond of no second brood
has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home
loaden with honour Say my request's unjust
and spurn me back but if it be not so
thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
that thou restrain'st from me the duty which
to a mother's part belongs He turns away
down ladies let us shame him with our knees
than pity to our prayers Down an end
this is the last so we will home to Rome
and die among our neighbours Nay behold us
this boy that cannot tell what he would have
but kneels and holds up hands for fellowship
does reason our petition with more strength
than thou hast to deny t Come let us go
this fellow had a Volscian to his mother
his wife is in Corioli and his child
like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire
and then I'll speak a little


O mother mother
what have you done Behold the heavens do ope
the gods look down and this unnatural scene
they laugh at O my mother mother O
you have won a happy victory to Rome
most dangerously you have with him prevail'd
if not most mortal to him But let it come
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars
I'll frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius
were you in my stead would you have heard
a mother less or granted less Aufidius

I was mov'd withal

I dare be sworn you were
and sir it is no little thing to make
mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir
what peace you'll make advise me for my part
I'll not to Rome I'll back with you and pray you
stand to me in this cause O mother wife

I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour
at difference in thee out of that I'll work
myself a former fortune

ay by and by
but we will drink together and you shall bear
a better witness back than words which we
on like conditions would have counter-seal'd
come enter with us Ladies you deserve
to have a temple built you all the swords
in Italy and her confederate arms
could not have made this peace


see you yond coign o' the Capitol yond corner-stone

why what of that

if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of Rome especially his mother may prevail with him But I say there is no hope in t Our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution

is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man


he loved his mother dearly

so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander What he bids be done is finished with his bidding He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in

yes mercy if you report him truly

I paint him in the character Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you

the gods be good unto us

no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us When we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us


sir if you'd save your life fly to your house
the plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
and hale him up and down all swearing if
the Roman ladies bring not comfort home
they'll give him death by inches

what's the news

good news good news the ladies have prevail'd
the Volscians are dislodg'd and Marcius gone
a merrier day did never yet greet Rome
no not the expulsion of the Tarquins

friend
art thou certain this is true is it most certain

as certain as I know the sun is fire
where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it
ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide
as the recomforted through the gates Why hark you

the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes
tabors and cymbals and the shouting Romans
make the sun dance Hark you

this is good news
I will go meet the ladies This Volumnia
is worth of consuls senators patricians
a city full of tribunes such as you
a sea and land full You have pray'd well to-day
this morning for ten thousand of your throats
I'd not have given a doit Hark how they joy


first the gods bless you for your tidings next
accept my thankfulness

sir we have all
great cause to give great thanks

they are near the city

almost at point to enter
we will meet them
and help the joy

behold our patroness the life of Rome
call all your tribes together praise the gods
and make triumphant fires strew flowers before them
unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius
repeal him with the welcome of his mother
cry Welcome ladies welcome

welcome ladies
welcome


go tell the lords o' the city I am here
deliver them this paper having read it
bid them repair to the market-place where I
even in theirs and in the commons' ears
will vouch the truth of it Him I accuse
intends to appear before the people hoping
to purge himself with words dispatch


most welcome

how is it with our general

even so
as with a man by his own alms empoison'd
and with his charity slain

most noble sir
if you do hold the same intent wherein
you wish'd us parties we'll deliver you
of your great danger

sir I cannot tell
we must proceed as we do find the people
the people will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all

I know it
and my pretext to strike at him admits
a good construction I rais'd him and I pawn'd
mine honour for his truth who being so heighten'd
he water'd his new plants with dews of flattery
seducing so my friends and to this end
he bow'd his nature never known before
but to be rough unswayable and free

sir his stoutness
when he did stand for consul which he lost
by lack of stooping

that I would have spoke of
being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth
made him joint-servant with me gave him way
in all his own desires nay let him choose
out of my files his projects to accomplish
my best and freshest men serv'd his designments
in mine own person holp to reap the fame
which he did end all his and took some pride
to do myself this wrong till at the last
I seem'd his follower not partner and
he wag'd me with his countenance as if
I had been mercenary

so he did my lord
the army marvell'd at it and in the last
when we had carried Rome and that we look'd
for no less spoil than glory

there was it
for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him
at a few drops of women's rheum which are
of our great action therefore shall he die
and I'll renew me in his fall But hark


your native town you enter'd like a post
and had no welcomes home but he returns
splitting the air with noise

and patient fools
whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
with giving him glory

therefore at your vantage
ere he express himself or move the people
with what he would say let him feel your sword
which we will second When he lies along
after your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
his reasons with his body

here come the lords


you are most welcome home

I have not deserv'd it
but worthy lords have you with heed perus'd
what I have written to you

we have

and grieve to hear t
what faults he made before the last I think
might have found easy fines but there to end
where he was to begin and give away
the benefit of our levies answering us
with our own charge making a treaty where
there was a yielding this admits no excuse



hail lords I am return'd your soldier
no more infected with my country's love
than when I parted hence but still subsisting
under your great command You are to know
that prosperously I have attempted and
with bloody passage led your wars even to
the gates of Rome Our spoils we have brought home
do more than counterpoise a full third part
the charges of the action We have made peace
with no less honour to the Antiates
than shame to the Romans and we here deliver
subscrib'd by the consuls and patricians
together with the seal o' the senate what
we have compounded on

read it not noble lords
but tell the traitor in the highest degree

traitor How now

ay traitor Marcius

Marcius

ay Marcius Caius Marcius Dost thou think
I'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli
you lords and heads of the state perfidiously
he has betray'd your business and given up
for certain drops of salt your city Rome
I say your city to his wife and mother
breaking his oath and resolution like
a twist of rotten silk never admitting
counsel o' the war but at his nurse's tears
he whin'd and roar'd away your victory
that pages blush'd at him and men of heart

hear'st thou Mars

name not the god thou boy of tears

ha

no more

measureless liar thou hast made my heart
too great for what contains it Boy O slave
pardon me lords tis the first time that ever
I was forc'd to scold Your judgments my grave lords
must give this cur the lie and his own notion
who wears my stripes impress'd upon him that
must bear my beating to his grave shall join
to thrust the lie unto him

peace both and hear me speak
cut me to pieces Volsces men and lads
stain all your edges on me Boy False hound
if you have writ your annals true tis there
that like an eagle in a dove-cote I
flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli
alone I did it Boy

why noble lords
will you be put in mind of his blind fortune
which was your shame by this unholy braggart
'Fore your own eyes and ears

let him die for t

tear him to pieces Do it presently He killed my son My daughter He killed my cousin Marcus He killed my father

peace ho no outrage peace
the man is noble and his fame folds in
this orb o' the earth His last offences to us
and trouble not the peace

O that I had him
with six Aufidiuses or more his tribe
to use my lawful sword

insolent villain

kill kill kill kill kill him


hold hold hold hold

my noble masters hear me speak

O Tullus

thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep

put up your swords

my lords when you shall know as in this rage
provok'd by him you cannot the great danger
which this man's life did owe you you'll rejoice
that he is thus cut off Please it your honours
to call me to your senate I'll deliver
myself your loyal servant or endure
your heaviest censure

bear from hence his body
and mourn you for him Let him be regarded
as the most noble corse that ever herald
did follow to his urn

his own impatience
takes from Aufidius a great part of blame
let's make the best of it

and I am struck with sorrow Take him up
help three o' the chiefest soldiers I'll be one
beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully
trail your steel pikes Though in this city he
hath widow'd and unchilded many a one
which to this hour bewail the injury
yet he shall have a noble memory
assist

and let us hear Bernardo speak of this

last night of all
when yond same star that's westward from the pole
had made his course to illume that part of heaven
where now it burns Marcellus and myself
the bell then beating one

peace break thee off look where it comes again


in the same figure like the king that's dead

thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio


most like it harrows me with fear and wonder

it would be spoke to

question it Horatio

what art thou that usurp'st this time of night
together with that fair and war-like form
in which the majesty of buried Denmark
did sometimes march by heaven I charge thee speak

it is offended

see it stalks away

stay speak speak I charge thee speak



how now Horatio you tremble and look pale
is not this something more than fantasy
what think you on t

before my God I might not this believe
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes

is it not like the king

as thou-art to thyself
such was the very armour he had on
when he the ambitious Norway combated
so frown'd he once when in an angry parle
he smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
'Tis strange

thus twice before and jump at this dead hour

in what particular thought to work I know not
but in the gross and scope of my opinion
this bodes some strange eruption to our state

good now sit down and tell me he that knows
why this same strict and most observant watch
so nightly toils the subject of the land
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
and foreign mart for implements of war
why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
does not divide the Sunday from the week
what might be toward that this sweaty haste
doth make the night joint-labourer with the day
who is t that can inform me

that can I
at least the whisper goes so Our last king
whose image even but now appear'd to us
thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride
dar'd to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet
for so this side of our known world esteem'd him
did slay this Fortinbras who by a seal'd compact
well ratified by law and heraldry
did forfeit with his life all those his lands
which he stood seiz'd of to the conqueror
against the which a moiety competent
was gaged by our king which had return'd
to the inheritance of Fortinbras
had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant
and carriage of the article design'd
his fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
of unimproved mettle hot and full
hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes
for food and diet to some enterprise
that hath a stomach in t which is no other
as it doth well appear unto our state
and terms compulsative those foresaid lands
so by his father lost And this I take it
is the main motive of our preparations
the source of this our watch and the chief head
of this post-haste and romage in the land

I think it be no other but e'en so
well may it sort that this portentous figure
comes armed through our watch so like the king
that was and is the question of these wars

a mote it is to trouble the mind's eye
in the most high and palmy state of Rome
a little ere the mightiest Julius fell
the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
disasters in the sun and the moist star
upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
and even the like precurse of fierce events
as harbingers preceding still the fates
and prologue to the omen coming on
have heaven and earth together demonstrated
unto our climatures and countrymen
but soft behold lo where it comes again


I'll cross it though it blast me Stay illusion
if thou hast any sound or use of voice
speak to me
if there be any good thing to be done
that may to thee do ease and grace to me
speak to me
if thou art privy to thy country's fate
which happily foreknowing may avoid
O speak
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
extorted treasure in the womb of earth


speak of it stay and speak Stop it Marcellus

shall I strike at it with my partisan

do if it will not stand

'Tis here

'Tis here


'Tis gone
we do it wrong being so majestical
to offer it the show of violence
for it is as the air invulnerable
and our vain blows malicious mockery


and then it started like a guilty thing
upon a fearful summons I have heard
the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
awake the god of day and at his warning
whether in sea or fire in earth or air
the extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine and of the truth herein
this present object made probation

it faded on the crowing of the cock
some say that ever gainst that season comes
wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated
the bird of dawning singeth all night long
and then they say no spirit can walk abroad
the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
so hallow'd and so gracious is the time
so have I heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in russet mantle clad
walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill
break we our watch up and by my advice
let us impart what we have seen to-night
unto young Hamlet for upon my life
this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
as needful in our loves fitting our duty

let's do't I pray and I this morning know
where we shall find him most conveniently


though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
the memory be green and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
together with remembrance of ourselves
therefore our sometime sister now our queen
the imperial jointress of this war-like state
have we as twere with a defeated joy
with one auspicious and one dropping eye
with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
in equal scale weighing delight and dole
taken to wife nor have we herein barr'd
your better wisdoms which have freely gone
with this affair along for all our thanks
now follows that you know young Fortinbras
holding a weak supposal of our worth
or thinking by our late dear brother's death
our state to be disjoint and out of frame
colleagued with the dream of his advantage
he hath not fail'd to pester us with message
importing the surrender of those lands
lost by his father with all bands of law
to our most valiant brother So much for him
thus much the business is we have here writ
to Norway uncle of young Fortinbras
who impotent and bed-rid scarcely hears
of this his nephew's purpose to suppress
his further gait herein in that the levies
the lists and full proportions are all made
out of his subject and we here dispatch
you good Cornelius and you Voltimand
for bearers of this greeting to old Norway
giving to you no further personal power
to business with the king more than the scope
of these delated articles allow
farewell and let your haste commend your duty

in that and all things will we show our duty

in that and all things will we show our duty

we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
and now Laertes what's the news with you
you told us of some suit what is't Laertes
you cannot speak of reason to the Dane
and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg Laertes
that shall not be my offer not thy asking
the head is not more native to the heart
the hand more instrumental to the mouth
than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
what wouldst thou have Laertes

dread my lord
your leave and favour to return to France
from whence though willingly I came to Denmark
to show my duty in your coronation
yet now I must confess that duty done
my thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon

have you your father's leave What says Polonius
he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
by laboursome petition and at last
upon his will I seal'd my hard consent
I do beseech you give him leave to go

take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine
and thy best graces spend it at thy will
but now my cousin Hamlet and my son

a little more than kin and less than kind

how is it that the clouds still hang on you

not so my lord I am too much i' the sun

good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
and let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
do not for ever with thy vailed lids
seek for thy noble father in the dust
passing through nature to eternity

ay madam it is common

if it be
why seems it so particular with thee

seems madam Nay it is I know not seems
'Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
nor customary suits of solemn black
nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath
no nor the fruitful river in the eye
nor the dejected haviour of the visage
together with all forms modes shows of grief
that can denote me truly these indeed seem
for they are actions that a man might play
but I have that within which passeth show
these but the trappings and the suits of woe

to give these mourning duties to your father
but you must know your father lost a father
that father lost lost his and the survivor bound
in filial obligation for some term
to do obsequious sorrow but to persever
in obstinate condolement is a course
of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
it shows a will most incorrect to heaven
a heart unfortified a mind impatient
an understanding simple and unschool'd
for what we know must be and is as common
as any the most vulgar thing to sense
why should we in our peevish opposition
take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaven
a fault against the dead a fault to nature
to reason most absurd whose common theme
is death of fathers and who still hath cried
from the first corse till he that died to-day
'This must be so We pray you throw to earth
as of a father for let the world take note
you are the most immediate to our throne
and with no less nobility of love
than that which dearest father bears his son
do I impart toward you For your intent
in going back to school in Wittenberg
it is most retrograde to our desire
and we beseech you bend you to remain
here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
our chiefest courtier cousin and our son

let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg

I shall in all my best obey you madam

why tis a loving and a fair reply
be as ourself in Denmark Madam come
this gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
no jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
and the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again
re-speaking earthly thunder Come away


O that this too too solid flesh would melt
thaw and resolve itself into a dew
or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
his canon gainst self-slaughter O God O God
how weary stale flat and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of this world
fie on t O fie tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely That it should come to this
but two months dead nay not so much not two
so excellent a king that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
must I remember why she would hang on him
as if increase of appetite had grown
by what it fed on and yet within a month
let me not think on't Frailty thy name is woman
a little month or ere those shoes were old
with which she follow'd my poor father's body
like Niobe all tears why she even she
O God a beast that wants discourse of reason
would have mourn'd longer married with mine uncle
my father's brother but no more like my father
than I to Hercules within a month
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
had left the flushing in her galled eyes
she married O most wicked speed to post
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
it is not nor it cannot come to good
but break my heart for I must hold my tongue



I am glad to see you well
Horatio or I do forget myself

the same my lord and your poor servant ever

sir my good friend I'll change that name with you
and what make you from Wittenberg Horatio
Marcellus

my good lord

I am very glad to see you

good even sir
but what in faith make you from Wittenberg

a truant disposition good my lord

nor shall you do mine ear that violence
to make it truster of your own report
against yourself I know you are no truant
but what is your affair in Elsinore
we'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart

my lord I came to see your father's funeral

I pray thee do not mock me fellow-student
I think it was to see my mother's wedding

indeed my lord it follow'd hard upon

thrift thrift Horatio the funeral bak'd meats
did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
ere I had ever seen that day Horatio
my father methinks I see my father


in my mind's eye Horatio

I saw him once he was a goodly king

he was a man take him for all in all
I shall not look upon his like again

my lord I think I saw him yesternight

saw who

my lord the king your father

the king my father

season your admiration for a while
with an attent ear till I may deliver
upon the witness of these gentlemen

for God's love let me hear

two nights together had these gentlemen
Marcellus and Bernardo on their watch
in the dead vast and middle of the night
been thus encounter'd a figure like your father
armed at points exactly cap-a-pe
appears before them and with solemn march
goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk'd
by their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes
within his truncheon's length whilst they distill'd
almost to jelly with the act of fear
stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
in dreadful secrecy impart they did
and I with them the third night kept the watch
where as they had deliver'd both in time
form of the thing each word made true and good
the apparition comes I knew your father

but where was this

my lord upon the platform where we watch'd

did you not speak to it

my lord I did
but answer made it none yet once methought
it lifted up its head and did address
itself to motion like as it would speak
but even then the morning cock crew loud
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanish'd from our sight

'Tis very strange

as I do live my honour'd lord tis true
and we did think it writ down in our duty

indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
hold you the watch to-night

we do my lord

we do my lord

arm'd say you

arm'd my lord

arm'd my lord

from top to toe

my lord from head to foot

my lord from head to foot
then saw you not his face

O yes my lord he wore his beaver up

what look'd he frowningly

a countenance more in sorrow than in anger

pale or red

nay very pale

and fix'd his eyes upon you

most constantly

I would I had been there

it would have much amaz'd you
very like very like Stay'd it long

while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred

longer longer

longer longer

not when I saw it

his beard was grizzled no

it was as I have seen it in his life
a sable silver'd

I will watch to-night
perchance twill walk again

I warrant it will
if it assume my noble father's person
I'll speak to it though hell itself should gape
and bid me hold my peace I pray you all
if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight
let it be tenable in your silence still
and whatsoever else shall hap to-night
give it an understanding but no tongue
I will requite your loves So fare you well
upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve
I'll visit you

our duty to your honour

your loves as mine to you Farewell

my father's spirit in arms all is not well
I doubt some foul play would the night were come
till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes

my necessaries are embark'd farewell
and sister as the winds give benefit
and convoy is assistant do not sleep
but let me hear from you

do you doubt that

for Hamlet and the trifling of his favour
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
a violet in the youth of primy nature
forward not permanent sweet not lasting
the perfume and suppliance of a minute
no more

no more but so

think it no more
for nature crescent does not grow alone
the inward service of the mind and soul
grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now
and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtue of his will but you must fear
his greatness weigh'd his will is not his own
for he himself is subject to his birth
he may not as unvalu'd persons do
carve for himself for on his choice depends
the safety and the health of the whole state
and therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
unto the voice and yielding of that body
whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
as he in his particular act and place
may give his saying deed which is no further
than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
if with too credent ear you list his songs
or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister
and keep you in the rear of your affection
out of the shot and danger of desire
the chariest maid is prodigal enough
if she unmask her beauty to the moon
virtue herself scapes not calumnious strokes
the canker galls the infants of the spring
too oft before their buttons be disclos'd
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
contagious blastments are most imminent
be wary then best safety lies in fear
youth to itself rebels though none else near

I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart But good my brother
do not as some ungracious pastors do
show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
whiles like a puff'd and reckless libertine
himself the primrose path of dalliance treads

O fear me not
I stay too long but here my father comes


a double blessing is a double grace

occasion smiles upon a second leave

yet here Laertes aboard aboard for shame
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
and you are stay'd for There my blessing with thee
and these few precepts in thy memory
look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue
nor any unproportion'd thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
the friends thou hast and their adoption tried
grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of entrance to a quarrel but being in
bear t that th' opposed may beware of thee
give every man thine ear but few thy voice
take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
but not express'd in fancy rich not gaudy
for the apparel oft proclaims the man
and they in France of the best rank and station
are most select and generous chief in that
neither a borrower nor a lender be
for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all to thine own self be true
and it must follow as the night the day
thou canst not then be false to any man
farewell my blessing season this in thee

most humbly do I take my leave my lord


farewell Ophelia and remember well
what I have said to you

'Tis in my memory lock'd
and you yourself shall keep the key of it

farewell


what is t Ophelia he hath said to you

so please you something touching the Lord Hamlet

marry well bethought
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
given private time to you and you yourself
have of your audience been most free and bounteous
if it be so as so tis put on me
you do not understand yourself so clearly
as it behoves my daughter and your honour
what is between you give me up the truth

he hath my lord of late made many tenders
of his affection to me

affection pooh you speak like a green girl
unsifted in such perilous circumstance
do you believe his tenders as you call them

I do not know my lord what I should think

marry I'll teach you think yourself a baby
that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly
or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
running it thus you'll tender me a fool

in honourable fashion

ay fashion you may call it go to go to

and hath given countenance to his speech my lord
with almost all the holy vows of heaven

ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know
when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
giving more light than heat extinct in both
even in their promise as it is a-making
you must not take for fire From this time
be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence
set your entreatments at a higher rate
than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet
believe so much in him that he is young
and with a larger tether may he walk
than may be given you in few Ophelia
not of that dye which their investments show
but mere implorators of unholy suits
breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
the better to beguile This is for all
I would not in plain terms from this time forth
have you so slander any moment's leisure
as to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
look to t I charge you come your ways

I shall obey my lord


the air bites shrewdly it is very cold

it is a nipping and an eager air

what hour now

I think it lacks of twelve
no it is struck

indeed I heard it not then it draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk

what does this mean my lord

the king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse
keeps wassail and the swaggering up-spring reels
and as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
the triumph of his pledge

is it a custom

ay marry is t
but to my mind though I am native here
and to the manner born it is a custom
more honour'd in the breach than the observance
makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations
they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
soil our addition and indeed it takes
from our achievements though perform'd at height
the pith and marrow of our attribute
so oft it chances in particular men
that for some vicious mole of nature in them
as in their birth wherein they are not guilty
since nature cannot choose his origin
by the o'ergrowth of some complexion
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
the form of plausive manners that these men
carrying I say the stamp of one defect
being nature's livery or fortune's star
their virtues else be they as pure as grace
as infinite as man may undergo
shall in the general censure take corruption
from that particular fault the dram of eale
to his own scandal


look my lord it comes

angels and ministers of grace defend us
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
be thy intents wicked or charitable
thou com'st in such a questionable shape
that I will speak to thee I'll call thee Hamlet
king father royal Dane O answer me
let me not burst in ignorance but tell
why thy canoniz'd bones hearsed in death
have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd
hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
to cast thee up again What may this mean
that thou dead corse again in complete steel
making night hideous and we fools of nature
so horridly to shake our disposition
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
say why is this wherefore what should we do


it beckons you to go away with it
as if it some impartment did desire
to you alone

look with what courteous action
it waves you to a more removed ground
but do not go with it

no by no means

it will not speak then will I follow it

do not my lord
why what should be the fear
I do not set my life at a pin's fee
and for my soul what can it do to that
being a thing immortal as itself
it waves me forth again I'll follow it

what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles o'er his base into the sea
and there assume some other horrible form
which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
and draw you into madness think of it
the very place puts toys of desperation
without more motive into every brain
that looks so many fathoms to the sea
and hears it roar beneath

it waves me still Go on I'll follow thee


hold off your hands

be rul'd you shall not go

my fate cries out
and makes each petty artery in this body
as hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve

still am I call'd Unhand me gentlemen

by heaven I'll make a ghost of him that lets me
I say away Go on I'll follow thee


he wares desperate with imagination

let's follow tis not fit thus to obey him


something is rotten in the state of Denmark

heaven will direct it

nay let's follow him


whither wilt thou lead me speak I'll go no further

mark me

I will

my hour is almost come
when I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
must render up myself

alas poor ghost
pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold

speak I am bound to hear

so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear

what

I am thy father's spirit
doom'd for a certain term to walk the night
and for the day confin'd to fast in fires
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
are burnt and purg'd away But that I am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison-house
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
thy knotted and combined locks to part
like quills upon the fretful porpentine
but this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and blood List list O list
if thou didst ever thy dear father love

O God

revenge his foul and most unnatural murder

murder

murder most foul as in the best it is
but this most foul strange and unnatural

haste me to know't that I with wings as swift
as meditation or the thoughts of love
may sweep to my revenge

I find thee apt
that rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear
'Tis given out that sleeping in mine orchard
a serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmark
is by a forged process of my death
rankly abus'd but know thou noble youth
the serpent that did sting thy father's life
now wears his crown

O my prophetic soul
my uncle

ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
so to seduce won to his shameful lust
the will of my most seeming-virtuous queen
O Hamlet what a falling-off was there
from me whose love was of that dignity
I made to her in marriage and to decline
upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
to those of mine
but virtue as it never will be mov'd
though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
so lust though to a radiant angel link'd
will sate itself in a celestial bed
and prey on garbage
but soft methinks I scent the morning air
brief let me be Sleeping within mine orchard
my custom always in the afternoon
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
with juice of cursed hebona in a vial
and in the porches of mine ears did pour
the leperous distilment whose effect
holds such an enmity with blood of man
that swift as quicksilver it courses through
the natural gates and alleys of the body
and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
and a most instant tetter bark'd about
most lazar-like with vile and loathsome crust
all my smooth body
thus was I sleeping by a brother's hand
of life of crown of queen at once dispatch'd
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
unhousel'd disappointed unanel'd
no reckoning made but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head
O horrible O horrible most horrible
if thou hast nature in thee bear it not
let not the royal bed of Denmark be
a couch for luxury and damned incest
but howsoever thou pursu'st this act
taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
to prick and sting her Fare thee well at once
and gins to pale his uneffectual fire
adieu adieu Hamlet remember me


O all you host of heaven O earth What else
and shall I couple hell O fie Hold hold my heart
and you my sinews grow not instant old
but bear me stiffly up Remember thee
ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe Remember thee
yea from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records
all saws of books all forms all pressures past
that youth and observation copied there
and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the book and volume of my brain
unmix'd with baser matter yes by heaven
O most pernicious woman
O villain villain smiling damned villain
that one may smile and smile and be a villain
at least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark

so uncle there you are Now to my word
it is Adieu adieu remember me
I have sworn t

my lord my lord

lord Hamlet

heaven secure him

so be it

hillo ho ho my lord

hillo ho ho boy come bird come

how is't my noble lord

what news my lord

O wonderful

good my lord tell it

no you will reveal it

not I my lord by heaven

nor I my lord

how say you then would heart of man once think it
but you'll be secret

ay by heaven my lord


there's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
but he's an arrant knave

there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
to tell us this

why right you are i' the right
and so without more circumstance at all
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
you as your business and desire shall point you
for every man hath business and desire
such as it is and for mine own poor part
look you I'll go pray

these are but wild and whirling words my lord

I am sorry they offend you heartily
yes faith heartily
there's no offence my lord

yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio
and much offence too Touching this vision here
it is an honest ghost that let me tell you
for your desire to know what is between us
o'ermaster't as you may And now good friends
as you are friends scholars and soldiers
give me one poor request

what is't my lord we will

never make known what you have seen to-night

my lord we will not

my lord we will not

nay but swear't
in faith
my lord not I

nor I my lord in faith

upon my sword

we have sworn my lord already

indeed upon my sword indeed

swear

Ah ha boy sayst thou so art thou there true-penny
come on you hear this fellow in the cellar-age
consent to swear

propose the oath my lord

swear by my sword

swear

hic et ubique then we'll shift our ground
come hither gentlemen
and lay your hands again upon my sword
never to speak of this that you have heard
swear by my sword

swear

well said old mole canst work i' the earth so fast
a worthy pioner once more remove good friends

O day and night but this is wondrous strange

and therefore as a stranger give it welcome
there are more things in heaven and earth Horatio
but come
here as before never so help you mercy
how strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
as I perchance hereafter shall think meet
to put an antic disposition on
that you at such times seeing me never shall
with arms encumber'd thus or this head-shake
or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
as Well well we know or We could an if we would
or If we list to speak or There be an if they might
or such ambiguous giving out to note
that you know aught of me this not to do
so grace and mercy at your most need help you
swear

swear


rest rest perturbed spirit So gentlemen
and what so poor a man as Hamlet is
may do to express his love and friending to you
God willing shall not lack Let us go in together
and still your fingers on your lips I pray
the time is out of joint O cursed spite
that ever I was born to set it right
nay come let's go together

give him this money and these notes Reynaldo

I will my lord

you shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo
before you visit him to make inquiry
of his behaviour

my lord I did intend it

marry well said very well said Look you sir
and how and who what means and where they keep
what company at what expense and finding
by this encompassment and drift of question
that they do know my son come you more nearer
than your particular demands will touch it
take you as twere some distant knowledge of him
as thus I know his father and his friends
and in part him do you mark this Reynaldo

ay very well my lord

'And in part him but you may say not well
but if't be he I mean he's very wild
addicted so and so and there put on him
what forgeries you please marry none so rank
as may dishonour him take heed of that
but sir such wanton wild and usual slips
as are companions noted and most known
to youth and liberty
as gaming my lord

ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
drabbing you may go so far

my lord that would dishonour him

faith no as you may season it in the charge
you must not put another scandal on him
that he is open to incontinency
that's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
that they may seem the taints of liberty
the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
a savageness in unreclaimed blood
of general assault

but my good lord

wherefore should you do this
ay my lord
I would know that

marry sir here's my drift
and I believe it is a fetch of warrant
you laying these slight sullies on my son
as twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working
mark you
your party in converse him you would sound
having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
the youth you breathe of guilty be assur'd
he closes with you in this consequence
'Good sir or so or friend or gentleman
according to the phrase or the addition
of man and country

very good my lord

and then sir does he this he does what was I about to say By the mass I was about to say something where did I leave
at closes in the consequence
at friend or so and gentleman

at closes in the consequence ay marry
he closes with you thus I know the gentleman
I saw him yesterday or t' other day
or then or then with such or such and as you say
there was a' gaming there o'ertook in s rouse
there falling out at tennis or perchance
'I saw him enter such a house of sale
videlicet a brothel or so forth
see you now
your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
and thus do we of wisdom and of reach
with windlasses and with assays of bias
by indirections find directions out
so by my former lecture and advice
shall you my son You have me have you not


God be wi' you fare you well

good my lord

observe his inclination in yourself

I shall my lord

and let him ply his music

well my lord

farewell


how now Ophelia what's the matter

alas my lord I have been so affrighted
with what in the name of God

my lord as I was sewing in my closet
lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbrac'd
no hat upon his head his stockings foul'd
ungarter'd and down-gyved to his ancle
pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
and with a look so piteous in purport
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors he comes before me

mad for thy love

my lord I do not know
but truly I do fear it

what said he

he took me by the wrist and held me hard
and with his other hand thus o'er his brow
he falls to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it Long stay'd he so
at last a little shaking of mine arm
and thrice his head thus waving up and down
he rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
that it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being That done he lets me go
and with his head over his shoulder turn'd
he seem'd to find his way without his eyes
for out o' doors he went without their help
and to the last bended their light on me

come go with me I will go seek the king
this is the very ecstasy of love
whose violent property fordoes itself
and leads the will to desperate undertakings
as oft as any passion under heaven
that does afflict our natures I am sorry

no my good lord but as you did command
I did repel his letters and denied
his access to me

that hath made him mad
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him I fear'd he did but trifle
and meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy
by heaven it is as proper to our age
to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
as it is common for the younger sort
to lack discretion Come go we to the king
this must be known which being kept close might move
more grief to hide than hate to utter love
come


welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
the need we have to use you did provoke
our hasty sending Something have you heard
of Hamlet's transformation so I call it
since nor the exterior nor the inward man
resembles that it was What it should be
more than his father's death that thus hath put him
so much from the understanding of himself
I cannot dream of I entreat you both
that being of so young days brought up with him
and since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour
that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
some little time so by your companies
to draw him on to pleasures and to gather
so much as from occasion you may glean
whe'r aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
that open'd lies within our remedy

good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you
and sure I am two men there are not living
to show us so much gentry and good will
as to expend your time with us awhile
for the supply and profit of our hope
your visitation shall receive such thanks
as fits a king's remembrance

both your majesties
might by the sovereign power you have of us
put your dread pleasures more into command
than to entreaty

but we both obey
and here give up ourselves in the full bent
to lay our service freely at your feet
to be commanded

thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern

thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
my too much changed son Go some of you
and bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is

heavens make our presence and our practices
pleasant and helpful to him

ay amen

the ambassadors from Norway my good lord
are joyfully return'd

thou still hast been the father of good news

have I my lord Assure you my good liege
I hold my duty as I hold my soul
both to my God and to my gracious king
and I do think or else this brain of mine
hunts not the trail of policy so sure
as it hath us'd to do that I have found

O speak of that that do I long to hear

give first admittance to the ambassadors
my news shall be the fruit to that great feast

thyself do grace to them and bring them in

he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found
the head and source of all your son's distemper

I doubt it is no-other but the main
his father's death and our o'erhasty marriage

well we shall sift him


welcome my good friends


most fair return of greetings and desires
upon our first he sent out to suppress
his nephew's levies which to him appear'd
to be a preparation gainst the Polack
but better look'd into he truly found
it was against your highness whereat griev'd
that so his sickness age and impotence
was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
on Fortinbras which he in brief obeys
receives rebuke from Norway and in fine
makes vow before his uncle never more
to give the assay of arms against your majesty
whereon old Norway overcome with joy
gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
and his commission to employ those soldiers
so levied as before against the Polack
with an entreaty herein further shown

through your dominions for this enterprise
on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down

it likes us well
and at our more consider'd time we'll read
answer and think upon this business
meantime we thank you for your well-took labour
go to your rest at night we'll feast together
most welcome home


this business is well ended
my liege and madam to expostulate
what majesty should be what duty is
why day is day night night and time is time
were nothing but to waste night day and time
therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
mad call I it for to define true madness
what is t but to be nothing else but mad
but let that go

more matter with less art

madam I swear I use no art at all
that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
and pity tis tis true a foolish figure
but farewell it for I will use no art
mad let us grant him then and now remains
that we find out the cause of this effect
or rather say the cause of this defect
for this effect defective comes by cause
thus it remains and the remainder thus
perpend
I have a daughter have while she is mine
who in her duty and obedience mark
hath given me this now gather and surmise
that's an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified'
is a vile phrase but you shall hear Thus
in her excellent white bosom these &c

came this from Hamlet to her

good madam stay awhile I will be faithful

"Doubt thou the stars are fire
doubt that the sun doth move
doubt truth to be a liar
but never doubt I love

O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not art to reckon my groans but that I love thee best O most best believe it Adieu
thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him HAMLET "

this in obedience hath my daughter shown me
and more above hath his solicitings
as they fell out by time by means and place

but how hath she
receiv'd his love

what do you think of me

as of a man faithful and honourable

I would fain prove so But what might you think
when I had seen this hot love on the wing
as I perceiv'd it I must tell you that
before my daughter told me what might you
or my dear majesty your queen here think
if I had play'd the desk or table-book
or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
or look'd upon this love with idle sight
what might you think No I went round to work
and my young mistress thus I did bespeak
'Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star
that she should lock herself from his resort
admit no messengers receive no tokens
which done she took the fruits of my advice
and he repulsed a short tale to make
fell into a sadness then into a fast
thence to a watch thence into a weakness
thence to a lightness and by this declension
into the madness wherein now he raves
and all we wail for

do you think tis this

it may be very likely

hath there been such a time I'd fain know that
that I have positively said Tis so
when it prov'd otherwise

not that I know
take this from this if this be otherwise

if circumstances lead me I will find
where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
within the centre

how may we try it further

you know sometimes he walks four hours together
here in the lobby

so he does indeed

at such a time I'll loose my daughter to him
be you and I behind an arras then
mark the encounter if he love her not
and be not from his reason fallen thereon
let me be no assistant for a state
but keep a farm and carters
we will try it

but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading

away I do beseech you both away
I'll board him presently

O give me leave

how does my good Lord Hamlet

well God a-mercy

do you know me my lord

excellent well you are a fishmonger

not I my lord


honest my lord

ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand

that's very true my lord

for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion Have you a daughter

I have my lord

let her not walk i' the sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive Friend look to t

how say you by that Still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said I was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love very near this I'll speak to him again What do you read my lord

words words words

what is the matter my lord


I mean the matter that you read my lord

slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab you could go backward

though this be madness yet there is method in t Will you walk out of the air my lord

into my grave

indeed that is out o' the air

how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter My honourable lord I will most humbly take my leave of you

you cannot sir take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life

fare you well my lord


these tedious old fools

you go to seek the Lord Hamlet there he is

God save you sir


mine honoured lord

my most dear lord

my excellent good friends How dost thou Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both

as the indifferent children of the earth

happy in that we are not over happy On Fortune's cap we are not the very button

nor the soles of her shoe

neither my lord
then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours

faith her privates we

in the secret parts of Fortune O most true she is a strumpet What news

none my lord but that the world's grown honest

then is doomsday near but your news is not true Let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither

prison my lord

Denmark's a prison

then is the world one

a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one o' the worst

we think not so my lord
why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison

why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind

O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams

which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream

a dream itself is but a shadow

truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow

then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows Shall we to the court for by my fay I cannot reason

we'll wait upon you

we'll wait upon you

no such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully attended But in the beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore
to visit you my lord no other occasion

beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come come deal justly with me come come nay speak

what should we say my lord

why anything but to the purpose You were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour I know the good king and queen have sent for you

to what end my lord

that you must teach me But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no

what say you

nay then I have an eye of you If you love me hold not off

my lord we were sent for

I will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours What a piece of work is a man How noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form in moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts

why did you laugh then when I said man delights not me

to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service

he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' the sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for't What players are they

even those you were wont to take delight in the tragedians of the city

how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways

I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation

do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city Are they so followed

no indeed they are not

how comes it Do they grow rusty
nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aery of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither

what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession

faith there has been much to-do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question

is it possible

O there has been much throwing about of brains

do the boys carry it away

ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too

it is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out


there are the players


in what my dear lord

I am but mad north-north-west when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw


well be with you gentlemen

hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts

happily he's the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child

I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it You say right sir o' Monday morning twas so indeed

my lord I have news to tell you

my lord I have news to tell you When Roscius was an actor in Rome

the actors are come hither my lord
buzz buzz

upon my honour

then came each actor on his ass

the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical historical-pastoral tragical-historical tragical-comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light For the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men

O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou

what a treasure had he my lord

why

one fair daughter and no more
the which he loved passing well


still on my daughter
am I not i' the right old Jephthah

if you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing well

nay that follows not

what follows then my lord

why
as by lot God wot
and then you know
it came to pass as most like it was
the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comes

you are welcome masters welcome all I am glad to see thee well welcome good friends O my old friend Thy face is valanced since I saw thee last comest thou to beard me in Denmark What my young lady and mistress By r lady your ladyship is nearer heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring Masters you are all welcome We'll e'en to't like French falconers fly at anything we see we'll have a speech straight Come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech

what speech my good lord

I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play I remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as I received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine One speech in it I chiefly loved twas neas' tale to Dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter If it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see
'tis not so it begins with Pyrrhus
the rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arm
black as his purpose did the night resemble
when he lay couched in the ominous horse
hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
with heraldry more dismal head to foot
now is he total gules horridly trick'd
with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
bak'd and impasted with the parching streets
that lend a tyrannous and damned light
to their vile murders rousted in wrath and fire
and thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore
with eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus
old grandsire Priam seeks
so proceed you

'Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion

anon he finds him
rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
repugnant to command Unequal match'd
Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide
but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
the unnerved father falls Then senseless Ilium
seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear for lo his sword
which was declining on the milky head
of rever end Priam seem'd i' the air to stick
so as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
and like a neutral to his will and matter
did nothing
but as we often see against some storm
a silence in the heavens the rack stand still
the bold winds speechless and the orb below
as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus' pause
aroused vengeance sets him new a-work
on Mars's armour forg'd for proof eterne
with less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
now falls on Priam
out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods
in general synod take away her power
break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
as low as to the fiends

this is too long

it shall to the barber's with your beard Prithee say on he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps Say on come to Hecuba

but who O who had seen the mobled queen

'The mobled queen

that's good mobled queen' is good

with bisson rheum a clout upon that head
where late the diadem stood and for a robe
about her lank and all o'er-teemed loins
a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
who this had seen with tongue in venom steep'd
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd
but if the gods themselves did see her then
when she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs
the instant burst of clamour that she made
unless things mortal move them not at all
would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
and passion in the gods

look wh'er he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes Prithee no more

'Tis well I'll have thee speak out the rest soon Good my lord will you see the players well bestowed Do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live

my lord I will use them according to their desert
God's bodikins man much better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping Use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty Take them in

come sirs

follow him friends we'll hear a play to-morrow

dost thou hear me old friend can you play the Murder of Gonzago

ay my lord

we'll ha't to-morrow night You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in't could you not

ay my lord

very well Follow that lord and look you mock him not

my good friends I'll leave you till night you are welcome to Elsinore

good my lord

ay so God be wi' ye Now I am alone
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I
is it not monstrous that this player here
but in a fiction in a dream of passion
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that from her working all his visage wann'd
tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect
a broken voice and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
for Hecuba
what s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
that he should weep for her What would he do
had he the motive and the cue for passion
that I have He would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
make mad the guilty and appal the free
confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears
a dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak
like John-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause
and can say nothing no not for a king
upon whose property and most dear life
a damn'd defeat was made Am I a coward
who calls me villain breaks my pate across
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i' the throat
as deep as to the lungs Who does me this
ha
swounds I should take it for it cannot be
but I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
to make oppression bitter or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
with this slave's offal Bloody bawdy villain
remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
O vengeance
why what an ass am I This is most brave
that I the son of a dear father murder'd
must like a whore unpack my heart with words
and fall a-cursing like a very drab
a scullion
fie upon't foh About my brain I have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul that presently
they have proclaim'd their malefactions
for murder though it have no tongue will speak
with most miraculous organ I'll have these players
play something like the murder of my father
before mine uncle I'll observe his looks
I'll tent him to the quick if he but blench
I know my course The spirit that I have seen
may be the devil and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy
as he is very potent with such spirits
abuses me to damn me I'll have grounds
wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king

and can you by no drift of circumstance
get from him why he puts on this confusion
grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy

he does confess he feels himself distracted
but from what cause he will by no means speak

nor do we find him forward to be sounded
but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
when we would bring him on to some confession
of his true state

did he receive you well

most like a gentleman


niggard of question but of our demands
most free in his reply

did you assay him
to any pastime

madam it so fell out that certain players
we o'er-raught on the way of these we told him
and there did seem in him a kind of joy
to hear of it they are about the court
and as I think they have already order
this night to play before him

'Tis most true
and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter

with all my heart and it doth much content me
good gentlemen give him a further edge
and drive his purpose on to these delights

we shall my lord


sweet Gertrude leave us too
for we have closely sent for Hamlet hither
that he as twere by accident may here
affront Ophelia
her father and myself lawful espials
will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
we may of their encounter frankly judge
and gather by him as he is behav'd
if t be the affliction of his love or no
that thus he suffers for

I shall obey you
and for your part Ophelia I do wish
of Hamlet's wildness so shall I hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again
to both your honours

madam I wish it may


Ophelia walk you here Gracious so please you
we will bestow ourselves

read on this book
that show of such an exercise may colour
your loneliness We are oft to blame in this
'Tis too much prov'd that with devotion's visage
and pious action we do sugar o'er
the devil himself

O tis too true
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
than is my deed to my most painted word
O heavy burden

I hear him coming let's withdraw my lord

to be or not to be that is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them To die to sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish'd To die to sleep
to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause There's the respect
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
the oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely
the pangs of dispriz'd love the law's delay
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of the unworthy takes
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
to grunt and sweat under a weary life
but that the dread of something after death
the undiscover'd country from whose bourn
no traveller returns puzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
and enterprises of great pith and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action Soft you now
be all my sins remember'd

good my lord
how does your honour for this many a day

I humbly thank you well well well

my lord I have remembrances of yours
that I have longed long to re-deliver
I pray you now receive them

no not I
I never gave you aught

my honour'd lord you know right well you did
and with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
as made the things more rich their perfume lost
take these again for to the noble mind
rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind

ha ha are you honest

my lord

are you fair

what means your lordship

that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty

could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty

ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof I did love thee once

indeed my lord you made me believe so

you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you not


get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in What should such fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth We are arrant knaves all believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery Where's your father

at home my lord

let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house Farewell

O help him you sweet heavens

if thou dost marry I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny Get thee to a nunnery go farewell Or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them To a nunnery go and quickly too Farewell

O heavenly powers restore him

I have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig you amble and you lisp and nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance Go to I'll no more on't it hath made me mad I say we will have no more marriages those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are To a nunnery go


O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown
the courtier's soldier's scholar's eye tongue sword
the expectancy and rose of the fair state
the observ'd of all observers quite quite down
and I of ladies most deject and wretched
that suck'd the honey of his music vows
now see that noble and most sovereign reason
like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
blasted with ecstasy O woe is me
to have seen what I have seen see what I see


love his affections do not that way tend
nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little
was not like madness There's something in his soul
o'er which his melancholy sits on brood
and I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
will be some danger which for to prevent
I have in quick determination
thus set it down he shall with speed to England
for the demand of our neglected tribute
with variable objects shall expel
this something-settled matter in his heart
whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
from fashion of himself What think you on't

it shall do well but yet do I believe
the origin and commencement of his grief
sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
you need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
we heard it all My lord do as you please
but if you hold it fit after the play
let his queen mother all alone entreat him
to show his griefs let her be round with him
and I'll be plac'd so please you in the ear
of all their conference If she find him not
to England send him or confine him where
your wisdom best shall think

it shall be so


speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rage to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant it out-herods Herod pray you avoid it

I warrant your honour

be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure Now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others O there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably

I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us

O reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it Go make you ready


how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work

and the queen too and that presently

bid the players make haste


we will my lord

we will my lord


what ho Horatio


here sweet lord at your service

Horatio thou art e'en as just a man
as e'er my conversation cop'd withal

O my dear lord

nay do not think I flatter
for what advancement may I hope from thee
that no revenue hast but thy good spirits
no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
and could of men distinguish her election
hath seal'd thee for herself for thou hast been
as one in suffering all that suffers nothing
a man that fortune's buffets and rewards
hast ta'en with equal thanks and bless'd are those
whose blood and judgment are so well comingled
that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
to sound what stop she please Give me that man
that is not passion's slave and I will wear him
in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart
as I do thee Something too much of this
there is a play to-night before the king
one scene of it comes near the circumstance
which I have told thee of my father's death
I prithee when thou seest that act afoot
observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt
do not itself unkennel in one speech
it is a damned ghost that we have seen
and my imaginations are as foul
as Vulcan's stithy Give him heedful note
for I mine eyes will rivet to his face
and after we will both our judgments join
in censure of his seeming

well my lord
if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
and scape detecting I will pay the theft

they are coming to the play I must be idle
get you a place

how fares our cousin Hamlet

excellent i' faith of the chameleon's dish I eat the air promise-crammed you cannot feed capons so
I have nothing with this answer Hamlet these words are not mine

no nor mine now

my lord you played once i' the university you say

that did I my lord and was accounted a good actor

and what did you enact

I did enact Julius C sar I was killed i' the Capitol Brutus killed me

it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there Be the playcrs ready

ay my lord they stay upon your patience

come hither my good Hamlet sit by me

no good mother here's metal more attractive
O ho do you mark that

lady shall I lie in your lap


no my lord

I mean my head upon your lap

ay my lord

do you think I meant country matters

I think nothing my lord

that's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs

what is my lord


you are merry my lord

who I

ay my lord

O God your only jig-maker What should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within's two hours

nay tis twice two months my lord

so long Nay then let the devil wear black for I'll have a suit of sables O heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year but by'r lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby-horse whose epitaph is For O for O the hobby-horse is forgot


what means this my lord

marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief

belike this show imports the argument of the play

we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel they'll tell all

will he tell us what this show meant

ay or any show that you'll show him be not you ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means

you are naught you are naught I'll mark the play


for us and for our tragedy
here stooping to your clemency
we beg your hearing patiently


is this a prologue or the posy of a ring

'Tis brief my lord



full thirty times hath Ph bus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground
and thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
about the world have times twelve thirties been
since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
unite commutual in most sacred bands

so many journeys may the sun and moon
make us again count o'er ere love be done
but woe is me you are so sick of late
so far from cheer and from your former state
that I distrust you Yet though I distrust
discomfort you my lord it nothing must
for women's fear and love holds quantity
in neither aught or in extremity
now what my love is proof hath made you know
and as my love is siz'd my fear is so
where little fears grow great great love grows there

faith I must leave thee love and shortly too
my operant powers their functions leave to do
and thou shall live in this fair world behind
honour'd belov'd and haply one as kind
for husband shalt thou

O confound the rest
such love must needs be treason in my breast
in second husband let me be accurst
none wed the second but who kill'd the first

wormwood wormwood

the instances that second marriage move
are base respects of thrift but none of love
a second time I kill my husband dead
when second husband kisses me in bed
I do believe you think what now you speak
but what we do determine oft we break
purpose is but the slave to memory
of violent birth but poor validity
which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
but fall unshaken when they mellow be
most necessary tis that we forget
to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
what to ourselves in passion we propose
the passion ending doth the purpose lose
the violence of either grief or joy
their own enactures with themselves destroy
where joy most revels grief doth most lament
grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
this world is not for aye nor tis not strange
that even our love should with our fortunes change
for tis a question left us yet to prove
whe'r love lead fortune or else fortune love
the great man down you mark his favourite flies
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend
for who not needs shall never lack a friend
and who in want a hollow friend doth try
directly seasons him his enemy
but orderly to end where I begun
our wills and fates do so contrary run
that our devices still are overthrown
our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
so think thou wilt no second husband wed
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead

nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
sport and repose lock from me day and night
to desperation turn my trust and hope
an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope
each opposite that blanks the face of joy
meet what I would have well and it destroy
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
if once a widow ever I be wife
if she should break it now

'Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile
my spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile
the tedious day with sleep


sleep rock thy brain
and never come mischance between us twain


madam how like you this play

the lady doth protest too much methinks

O but she'll keep her word

have you heard the argument Is there no offence in t


what do you call the play

the Mouse-trap Marry how Tropically This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna Gonzago is the duke's name his wife Baptista You shall see anon tis a knavish piece of work but what of that your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not let the galled jade wince our withers are unwrung

this is one Lucianus nephew to the king

you are a good chorus my lord

I could interpret between you and your love if I could see the puppets dallying

you are keen my lord you are keen

it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge

still better and worse

so you must take your husbands Begin murderer pox leave thy damnable faces and begin Come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge

confederate season else no creature seeing
thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected
with Hecate's ban thrice blasted thrice infected
thy natural magic and dire property
on wholesome life usurp immediately


he poisons him i' the garden for's estate Hisname's Gonzago the story is extant and writ in very choice Italian You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife

the king rises

what frighted with false fire

how fares my lord

give o'er the play

give me some light away


why let the stricken deer go weep
the hart ungalled play
for some must watch while some must sleep
so runs the world away

would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sir

half a share

a whole one I

for thou dost know O Damon dear
this realm dismantled was
of Jove himself and now reigns here
a very very pajock


you might have rimed
O good Horatio I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound Didst perceive

very well my lord

upon the talk of the poisoning

I did very well note him

Ah ha Come some music come the recorders

for if the king like not the comedy
why then belike he likes it not perdy

come some music


good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you

sir a whole history
the king sir

ay sir what of him

is in his retirement marvellous distempered

with drink sir

no my lord rather with choler

your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler

good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair

I am tame sir pronounce

the queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you

you are welcome
nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do your mother's commandment if not your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business

sir I cannot

what my lord

make you a wholesome answer my wit's diseased but sir such answer as I can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you say

then thus she says your behaviour hath struck her into amasement and admiration

O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration Impart

she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed

we shall obey were she ten times our mother Have you any further trade with us

my lord you once did love me

so I do still by these pickers and stealers
good my lord what is your cause of distemper you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend

sir I lack advancement

how can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark

ay sir but While the grass grows the proverb is something musty

O the recorders let me see one To withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil

O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly

I do not well understand that Will you play upon this pipe

my lord I cannot

I pray you

believe me I cannot
I do beseech you

I know no touch of it my lord

'Tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with your finger and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music Look you these are the stops

but these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony I have not the skill

why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me You would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak Sblood do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe Call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me

God bless you sir

my lord the queen would speak with you and presently

do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel

by the mass and tis like a camel indeed

methinks it is like a weasel
it is backed like a weasel

or like a whale

very like a whale

then I will come to my mother by and by

they fool me to the top of my bent [Aloud ] I will come by and by

I will say so


by and by is easily said Leave me friends

'Tis now the very witching time of night
when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
contagion to this world now could I drink hot blood
and do such bitter business as the day
O heart lose not thy nature let not ever
the soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
let me be cruel not unnatural
I will speak daggers to her but use none
my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
how in my words soever she be shent
to give them seals never my soul consent


I like him not nor stands it safe with us
to let his madness range Therefore prepare you
I your commission will forth with dispatch
and he to England shall along with you
the terms of our estate may not endure
hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
out of his lunacies

we will ourselves provide
most holy and religious fear it is
that live and feed upon your majesty

the single and peculiar life is bound
with all the strength and armour of the mind
to keep itself from noyance but much more
that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
the lives of many The cease of majesty
dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
what's near it with it it is a massy wheel
fix'd on the summit of the highest mount
to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
are mortis'd and adjoin'd which when it falls
each small annexment petty consequence
attends the boisterous ruin Never alone
did the king sigh but with a general groan

arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage
for we will fetters put upon this fear
which now goes too free-footed
we will haste us

we will haste us

my lord he's going to his mother's closet
behind the arras I'll convey myself
to hear the process I'll warrant she'll tax him home
and as you said and wisely was it said
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother
since nature makes them partial should o'erhear
the speech of vantage Fare you well my liege
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
and tell you what I know

thanks dear my lord

O my offence is rank it smells to heaven
it hath the primal eldest curse upon't
a brother's murder Pray can I not
my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
and like a man to double business bound
I stand in pause where I shall first begin
and both neglect What if this cursed hand
were thicker than itself with brother's blood
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
to wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence
and what's in prayer but this two-fold force
to be forestalled ere we come to fall
or pardon'd being down Then I'll look up
my fault is past But O what form of prayer
can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder
that cannot be since I am still possess'd
of those effects for which I did the murder
my crown mine own ambition and my queen
may one be pardon'd and retain the offence
in the corrupted currents of this world
offence's gilded hand may shove by justice
buys out the law but tis not so above
there is no shuffling there the action lies
in his true nature and we ourselves compell'd
even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
to give in evidence What then what rests
try what repentance can what can it not
yet what can it when one can not repent
O wretched state O bosom black as death
O limed soul that struggling to be free
art more engaged Help angels make assay
bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
be soft as sinews of the new-born babe
all may be well

now might I do it pat now he is praying
and now I'll do't and so he goes to heaven
and so am I reveng'd That would be scann'd
a villain kills my father and for that
I his sole son do this same villain send
why this is hire and salary not revenge
he took my father grossly full of bread
with all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
and how his audit stands who knows save heaven
but in our circumstance and course of thought
'Tis heavy with him And am I then reveng'd
to take him in the purging of his soul
when he is fit and season'd for his passage
no
up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
when he is drunk asleep or in his rage
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed
at gaming swearing or about some act
that has no relish of salvation in't
then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
and that his soul may be as damn'd and black
as hell whereto it goes My mother stays
this physic but prolongs thy sickly days

words without thoughts never to heaven go


he will come straight Look you lay home to him
tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
and that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
much heat and him I'll silence me e'en here
pray you be round with him

mother mother mother

I'll warrant you
fear me not Withdraw I hear him coming


now mother what's the matter

Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended


come come you answer with an idle tongue

go go you question with a wicked tongue

why how now Hamlet

what's the matter now

have you forgot me

no by the rood not so
you are the queen your husband's brother's wife
and would it were not so you are my mother

nay then I'll set those to you that can speak

come come and sit you down you shall not budge
you go not till I set you up a glass

what wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me
help help ho

what ho help help help

how now a rat Dead for a ducat dead


O I am slain

O me what hast thou done

nay I know not is it the king

O what a rash and bloody deed is this

a bloody deed almost as bad good mother
as kill a king and marry with his brother
as kill a king

ay lady twas my word

thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
I took thee for thy better take thy fortune
thou find'st to be too busy is some danger
leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
and let me wring your heart for so I shall
if it be made of penetrable stuff
if damned custom have not brass'd it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sense

what have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
in noise so rude against me

such an act
that blurs the grace and blush of modesty
calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
and sets a blister there makes marriage vows
as false as dicers' oaths O such a deed
as from the body of contraction plucks
the very soul and sweet religion makes
a rhapsody of words heaven's face doth glow
yea this solidity and compound mass
with tristful visage as against the doom
is thought-sick at the act

ay me what act
that roars so loud and thunders in the index

look here upon this picture and on this
the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow
Hyperion's curls the front of Jove himself
an eye like Mars to threaten and command
a station like the herald Mercury
new-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill
where every god did seem to set his seal
to give the world assurance of a man
this was your husband look you now what follows
here is your husband like a mildew'd ear
blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
and batten on this moor Ha have you eyes
you cannot call it love for at your age
the hey-day in the blood is tame it's humble
and waits upon the judgment and what judgment
would step from this to this Sense sure you have
else could you not have motion but sure that sense
is apoplex'd for madness would not err
nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
but it reserv'd some quantity of choice
to serve in such a difference What devil was t
that thus hath comen'd you at hoodman-blind
eyes without feeling feeling without sight
ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
could not so mope
O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell
if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
when the compulsive ardour gives the charge
since first itself as actively doth burn
and reason panders will

O Hamlet speak no more
thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul
and there I see such black and grained spots
as will not leave their tinct

nay but to live
in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
stew'd in corruption honeying and making love
over the nasty sty

these words like daggers enter in mine ears
no more sweet Hamlet

a murderer and a villain
a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
of your precedent lord a vice of kings
a cut-purse of the empire and the rule
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
and put it in his pocket

no more

a king of shreds and patches


save me and hover o'er me with your wings

you heavenly guards What would your gracious figure


do you not come your tardy son to chide
that laps'd in time and passion lets go by
the important acting of your dread command
O say

do not forget this visitation
is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
but look amazement on thy mother sits
O step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
speak to her Hamlet

how is it with you lady

alas how is't with you
that you do bend your eye on vacancy
and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
your bedded hair like life in excrements
starts up and stands an end O gentle son
upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look

on him on him Look you how pale he glares
his form and cause conjoin'd preaching to stones
would make them capable Do not look upon me
lest with this piteous action you convert
my stern effects then what I have to do
will want true colour tears perchance for blood

to whom do you speak this

do you see nothing there

nothing at all yet all that is I see

nor did you nothing hear
no nothing but ourselves

why look you there look how it steals away
my father in his habit as he liv'd
look where he goes even now out at the portal


this is the very coinage of your brain
this bodiless creation ecstasy
is very cunning in

ecstasy
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
and makes as healthful music It is not madness
that I have utter'd bring me to the test
and I the matter will re-word which madness
would gambol from Mother for love of grace
lay not that flattering unction to your soul
that not your trespass but my madness speaks
whiles rank corruption mining all within
infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven
repent what's past avoid what is to come
and do not spread the compost on the weeds
to make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue
for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
yea curb and woo for leave to do him good

O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain

O throw away the worser part of it
and live the purer with the other half
good night but go not to mine uncle's bed
assume a virtue if you have it not
that monster custom who all sense doth eat
of habits devil is angel yet in this
that to the use of actions fair and good
he likewise gives a frock or livery
and that shall lend a kind of easiness
to the next abstinence the next more easy
for use almost can change the stamp of nature
and master ev'n the devil or throw him out
with wondrous potency Once more goodnight
and when you are desirous to be bless'd
I'll blessing beg of you For this same lord

I do repent but heaven hath pleas'd it so
to punish me with this and this with me
that I must be their scourge and minister
I will bestow him and will answer well
the death I gave him So again good-night
I must be cruel only to be kind
thus bad begins and worse remains behind
one word more good lady

what shall I do

let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
and let him for a pair of reechy kisses
or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers
make you to ravel all this matter out
that I essentially am not in madness
but mad in craft Twere good you let him know
for who that's but a queen fair sober wise
would from a paddock from a bat a gib
such dear concernings hide who would do so
no in despite of sense and secrecy
unpeg the basket on the house's top
let the birds fly and like the famous ape
to try conclusions in the basket creep
and break your own neck down

be thou assur'd if words be made of breath
and breath of life I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me
I must to England you know that

alack
I had forgot tis so concluded on

there's letters seal'd and my two schoolfellows
whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd
they bear the mandate they must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery Let it work
for tis the sport to have the enginer
hoist with his own petar and it shall go hard
but I will delve one yard below their mines
and blow them at the moon O tis most sweet
when in one line two crafts directly meet
this man shall set me packing
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room
mother good-night Indeed this counsellor
is now most still most secret and most grave
who was in life a foolish prating knave
good-night mother

there's matter in these sighs these profound heaves
you must translate tis fit we understand them
where is your son

bestow this place on us a little while

Ah my good lord what have I seen to-night

what Gertrude How does Hamlet

mad as the sea and wind when both contend
which is the mightier In his lawless fit
behind the arras hearing something stir
whips out his rapier cries A rat a rat
and in his brainish apprehension kills
the unseen good old man

it had been so with us had we been there
his liberty is full of threats to all
to you yourself to us to every one
alas how shall this bloody deed be answer'd
it will be laid to us whose providence
should have kept short restrain'd and out of haunt
this mad young man but so much was our love
we would not understand what was most fit
but like the owner of a foul disease
to keep it from divulging let it feed
even on the pith of life Where is he gone

to draw apart the body he hath kill'd
o'er whom his very madness like some ore
among a mineral of metals base
shows itself pure he weeps for what is done

O Gertrude come away
the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
we must with all our majesty and skill
both countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern


friends both go join you with some further aid
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
and from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him
go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
into the chapel I pray you haste in this

come Gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends
and let them know both what we mean to do
and what's untimely done so haply slander
whose whisper o'er the world's diameter
as level as the cannon to his blank
transports his poison'd shot may miss our name
and hit the woundless air O come away
my soul is full of discord and dismay


Hamlet Lord Hamlet

Hamlet Lord Hamlet

what noise who calls on Hamlet
O here they come


what have you done my lord with the dead body

compounded it with dust whereto tis kin

tell us where tis that we may take it thence
and bear it to the chapel

do not believe it

believe what
that I can keep your counsel and not mine own Besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king

take you me for a sponge my lord

ay sir that soaks up the king's countenance his rewards his authorities But such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again

I understand you not my lord

I am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear

my lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king

the body is with the king but the king is not with the body The king is a thing

a thing my lord

of nothing bring me to him Hide fox and all after


how dangerous is it that this man goes loose
yet must not we put the strong law on him
he's lov'd of the distracted multitude
who like not in their judgment but their eyes
and where tis so the offender's scourge is weigh'd
but never the offence To bear all smooth and even
this sudden sending him away must seem
deliberate pause diseases desperate grown
by desperate appliance are reliev'd
or not at all

how now what hath befall'n

where the dead body is bestow'd my lord
we cannot get from him

but where is he

without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
bring him before us

ho Guildenstern bring in my lord


now Hamlet where's Polonius

at supper

at supper Where

not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him Your worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table that's the end

alas alas

a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm

what dost thou mean by this


where is Polonius

in heaven send thither to see if your messenger find him not there seek him i' the other place yourself But indeed if you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby

go seek him there

he will stay till you come


Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety
which we do tender as we dearly grieve
for that which thou hast done must send thee hence
with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself
the bark is ready and the wind at help
the associates tend and every thing is bent
for England

for England
ay Hamlet

good

so is it if thou knew'st our purposes

I see a cherub that sees them But come for England Farewell dear mother

thy loving father Hamlet

my mother father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother Come for England


follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard
delay it not I'll have him hence to-night
away for every thing is seal'd and done
that else leans on the affair pray you make haste

and England if my love thou hold'st at aught
since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
after the Danish sword and thy free awe
pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set
our sovereign process which imports at full
by letters conjuring to that effect
the present death of Hamlet Do it England
for like the hectic in my blood he rages
and thou must cure me Till I know tis done
howe'er my haps my joys were ne'er begun


go captain from me greet the Danish king
tell him that by his licence Fortinbras
claims the conveyance of a promis'd march
over his kingdom You know the rendezvous
if that his majesty would aught with us
we shall express our duty in his eye
and let him know so


go softly on

good sir whose powers are these

they are of Norway sir

how purpos'd sir I pray you

against some part of Poland

who commands them sir

the nephew to old Norway Fortinbras

goes it against the main of Poland sir
or for some frontier

truly to speak and with no addition
that hath in it no profit but the name
to pay five ducats five I would not farm it
nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
a ranker rate should it be sold in fee

why then the Polack never will defend it

yes tis already garrison'd

two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
will not debate the question of this straw
this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace
that inward breaks and shows no cause without
why the man dies I humbly thank you sir

God be wi' you sir


will t please you go my lord
I'll be with you straight Go a little before

how all occasions do inform against me
and spur my dull revenge What is a man
if his chief good and market of his time
be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
sure he that made us with such large discourse
looking before and after gave us not
that capability and god-like reason
to fust in us unus'd Now whe'r it be
bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
of thinking too precisely on the event
a thought which quarter'd hath but one part wisdom
and ever three parts coward I do not know
why yet I live to say This thing's to do
sith I have cause and will and strength and means
to do t Examples gross as earth exhort me
witness this army of such mass and charge
led by a delicate and tender prince
makes mouths at the invisible event
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune death and danger dare
even for an egg-shell Rightly to be great
is not to stir without great argument
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
when honour's at the stake How stand I then
that have a father kill'd a mother stain'd
excitements of my reason and my blood
and let all sleep while to my shame I see
the imminent death of twenty thousand men
that for a fantasy and trick of fame
go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
which is not tomb enough and continent
to hide the slaim O from this time forth
my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth



she is importunate indeed distract
her mood will needs be pitied

what would she have

she speaks much of her father says she hears
there's tricks i' the world and hems and beats her heart
spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
that carry but half sense her speech is nothing
yet the unshaped use of it doth move
the hearers to collection they aim at it
and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them
indeed would make one think there might be thought
though nothing sure yet much unhappily

'Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds
let her come in

to my sick soul as sin's true nature is
each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
so full of artless jealousy is guilt
it spills itself in fearing to be spilt


where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark

how now Ophelia


how should I your true love know
from another one
by his cockle hat and staff
and his sandal shoon



say you nay pray you mark

he is dead and gone lady
he is dead and gone
at his head a grass-green turf
at his heals a stone

O ho

nay but Ophelia

pray you mark

white his shroud as the mountain snow

alas look here my lord


which bewept to the grave did go
with true-love showers


how do you pretty lady

well God ild you They say the owl was a baker's daughter Lord we know what we are but know not what we may be God be at your table

conceit upon her father

pray you let's have no words of this but when they ask you what it means say you this

to-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
all in the morning betime
and I a maid at your window
to be your Valentine
then up he rose and donn'd his clothes
and dupp'd the chamber door
let in the maid that out a maid


pretty Ophelia

indeed la without an oath I'll make an end on t

by Gis and by Saint Charity
alack and fie for shame
young men will do't if they come to't
by Cock they are to blame
quoth she before you tumbled me
you promis'd me to wed
so would I ha' done by yonder sun
an thou hadst not come to my bed


how long hath she been thus

I hope all will be well We must be patient but I cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him i' the cold ground My brother shall know of it and so I thank you for your good counsel Come my coach Good-night ladies good-night sweet ladies good-night good-night

follow her close give her good watch I pray you

O this is the poison of deep grief it springs
all from her father's death O Gertrude Gertrude
when sorrows come they come not single spies
but in battalions First her father slain
next your son gone but he most violent author
of his own just remove the people muddied
thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
for good Polonius' death and we have done but greenly
in hugger-mugger to inter him poor Ophelia
divided from herself and her fair judgment
without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
last and as much containing as all these
her brother is in secret come from France
feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds
and wants not buzzers to infect his ear
with pestilent speeches of his father's death
will nothing stick our person to arraign
in ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this
like to a murdering-piece in many places
gives me superfluous death


alack what noise is this


where are my Switzers Let them guard the door
what is the matter

save yourself my lord
the ocean overpeering of his list
eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
than young Laertes in a riotous head
o'erbears your officers The rabble call him lord
and as the world were now but to begin
antiquity forgot custom not known
they cry Choose we Laertes shall be king
caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
'Laertes shall be king Laertes king

how cheerfully on the false trail they cry
O this is counter you false Danish dogs

the doors are broke

where is the king Sirs stand you all without

no let's come in

I pray you give me leave

we will we will


I thank you keep the door O thou vile king

calmly good Laertes

that drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard
cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
of my true mother

what is the cause Laertes
that thy rebellion looks so giant-like
let him go Gertrude do not fear our person
there's such divinity doth hedge a king
that treason can but peep to what it would
acts little of his will Tell me Laertes
why thou art thus incens'd Let him go Gertrude
speak man

where is my father


but not by him

let him demand his fill

how came he dead I'll not be juggled with
to hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
I dare damnation To this point I stand
that both the worlds I give to negligence
let come what comes only I'll be reveng'd
most throughly for my father

who shall stay you

my will not all the world
and for my means I'll husband them so well
they shall go far with little

if you desire to know the certainty
of your dear father's death is't writ in your revenge
that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
winner and loser

none but his enemies

will you know them then

to his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
and like the kind life-rendering pelican
repast them with my blood

why now you speak
like a good child and a true gentleman
that I am guiltless of your father's death
and am most sensibly in grief for it
it shall as level to your judgment pierce
as day does to your eye
let her come in

how now what noise is that


O heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt
burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
by heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
till our scale turn the beam O rose of May
dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
O heavens is't possible a young maid's wits
should be as mortal as an old man's life
nature is fine in love and where tis fine
it sends some precious instance of itself

after the thing it loves


they bore him barefac'd on the bier
and in his grave rain'd many a tear

fare you well my dove

hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
it could not move thus


you must sing a-down a-down
and you call him a-down-a

O how the wheel becomes it It is the false steward that stole his master's daughter

this nothing's more than matter

there's rosemary that's for remembrance brance pray love remember and there is pansies that's for thoughts

a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted


for bonny sweet Robin is all my joy


thought and affliction passion hell itself
she turns to favour and to prettiness


and will he not come again
and will he not come again
no no he is dead
go to thy death-bed
he never will come again
his beard was as white as snow
all fiaxen was his poll
he is gone he is gone
and we cast away moan
God ha' mercy on his soul



do you see this O God

Laertes I must common with your grief
or you deny me right Go but apart
make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
and they shall hear and judge twixt you and me
if by direct or by collateral hand
they find us touch'd we will our kingdom give
our crown our life and all that we call ours
to you in satisfaction but if not
be you content to lend your patience to us
and we shall jointly labour with your soul
to give it due content

let this be so
his means of death his obscure burial
no trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones
cry to be heard as twere from heaven to earth
that I must call t in question

so you shall
and where the offence is let the great axe fall
I pray you go with me


what are they that would speak with me

sailors sir they say they have letters for you

let them come in

I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet


God bless you sir
let him bless thee too

he shall sir an't please him There's a letter for you sir it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England if your name be Horatio as I am let to know it is

Horatio when thou shalt have overlooked this give these fellows some means to the king they have letters for him Ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very war-like appointment gave us chase Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valour in the grapple I boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship so I alone became their prisoner They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for them Let the king have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter These good fellows will bring thee where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England of them I have much to tell thee Farewell
he that thou knowest thine
come I will give you way for these your letters
and do t the speedier that you may direct me
to him from whom you brought them


now must your conscience my acquittance seal
and you must put me in your heart for friend
sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
that he which hath your noble father slain
pursu'd my life

it well appears but tell me
why you proceeded not against these feats
as by your safety wisdom all things else
you mainly were stirr'd up

O for two special reasons
which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew'd
but yet to me they are strong The queen his mother
lives almost by his looks and for myself
my virtue or my plague be it either which
she's so conjunctive to my life and soul
that as the star moves not but in his sphere
I could not but by her The other motive
why to a public count I might not go
is the great love the general gender bear him
who dipping all his faults in their affection
would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind
would have reverted to my bow again
and not where I had aim'd them
and so have I a noble father lost
a sister driven into desperate terms
whose worth if praises may go back again
stood challenger on mount of all the age
for her perfections But my revenge will come

break not your sleeps for that you must not think
that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
that we can let our beard be shook with danger
and think it pastime You shortly shall hear more
I lov'd your father and we love ourself
and that I hope will teach you to imagine

how now what news

letters my lord from Hamlet
this to your majesty this to the queen

from Hamlet who brought them
sailors my lord they say I saw them not
they were given me by Claudio he receiv'd them
of him that brought them

Laertes you shall hear them
leave us

high and mighty you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return
what should this mean Are all the rest come back
or is it some abuse and no such thing

know you the hand

'Tis Hamlet's character Naked
and in a postscript here he says alone
can you advise me

I'm lost in it my lord But let him come
it warms the very sickness in my heart
'Thus diddest thou

if it be so Laertes
as how should it be so how otherwise
will you be rul'd by me

ay my lord
so you will not o'er-rule me to a peace

to thine own peace If he be now return'd
as checking at his voyage and that he means
no more to undertake it I will work him
to an exploit now ripe in my device
under the which he shall not choose but fall
and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
but even his mother shall uncharge the practice
and call it accident

my lord I will be rul'd
that I might be the organ

it falls right
you have been talk'd of since your travel much
and that in Hamlet's hearing for a quality
wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
did not together pluck such envy from him
as did that one and that in my regard
of the unworthiest siege

what part is that my lord

a very riband in the cap of youth
yet needful too for youth no less becomes
the light and careless livery that it wears
than settled age his sables and his weeds
importing health and graveness Two months since
here was a gentleman of Normandy
I've seen myself and serv'd against the French
had witchcraft in t he grew unto his seat
and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
as he had been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
with the brave beast so far he topp'd my thought
that I in forgery of shapes and tricks
come short of what he did

a Norman was t

a Norman

upon my life Lamord

the very same

I know him well he is the brooch indeed
and gem of all the nation

he made confession of you
for art and exercise in your defence
and for your rapier most especially
that he cried out twould be a sight indeed
if one could match you the scrimers of their nation
he swore had neither motion guard nor eye
if you oppos'd them Sir this report of his
did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
that he could nothing do but wish and beg
your sudden coming o'er to play with him
now out of this

what out of this my lord

Laertes was your father dear to you
or are you like the painting of a sorrow
a face without a heart

why ask you this

but that I know love is begun by time
and that I see in passages of proof
time qualifies the spark and fire of it
there lives within the very flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
and nothing is at a like goodness still
for goodness growing to a plurisy
dies in his own too-much That we would do
we should do when we would for this would' changes
and hath abatements and delays as many
as there are tongues are hands are accidents
and then this should' is like a spendthrift sigh
that hurts by easing But to the quick o' the ulcer
Hamlet comes back what would you undertake
to show yourself your father's son in deed
more than in words

to cut his throat i' the church

revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes
will you do this keep close within your chamber
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home
we'll put on those shall praise your excellence
and set a double varnish on the fame
the Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
and wager on your heads he being remise
most generous and free from all contriving
will not peruse the foils so that with ease
or with a little shuffling you may choose
a sword unbated and in a pass of practice
requite him for your father

I will do t
and for that purpose I'll anoint my sword
I bought an unction of a mountebank
so mortal that but dip a knife in it
where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
collected from all simples that have virtue
that is but scratch'd withal I'll touch my point
with this contagion that if I gall him slightly
it may be death

let's further think of this
weigh what convenience both of time and means
may fit us to our shape If this should fail
and that our drift look through our bad performance
'Twere better not assay'd therefore this project
should have a back or second that might hold
if this should blast in proof Soft let me see
we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings
I ha't
when in your motion you are hot and dry
as make your bouts more violent to that end
and that he calls for drink I'll have prepar'd him
a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck
our purpose may hold there But stay what noise
how now sweet queen

one woe doth tread upon another's heel
so fast they follow your sister's drown'd Laertes

drown'd O where

there is a willow grows aslant a brook
that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
there with fantastic garlands did she come
of crow-flowers nettles daisies and long purples
that liberal shepherds give a grosser name
but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them
there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
clambering to hang an envious sliver broke
when down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide
and mermaid-like awhile they bore her up
which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
or like a creature native and indu'd
unto that element but long it could not be
till that her garments heavy with their drink
pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
to muddy death

alas then she is drown'd

drown'd drown'd

too much of water hast thou poor Ophelis
and therefore I forbid my tears but yet
it is our trick nature her custom holds
let shame say what it will when these are gone
the woman will be out Adieu my lord
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
but that this folly douts it


how much I had to do to calm his rage
now fear I this will give it start again
therefore let's follow

is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation

I tell thee she is and therefore make her grave straight the crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial

how can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defence

why tis found so

it must be se offendendo it cannot be else For here lies the point if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is to act to do and to perform argal she drowned herself wittingly

nay but hear you goodman delver

give me leave Here lies the water good here stands the man good if the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goes mark you that but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself argal he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life

but is this law
ay marry is t crowner's quest law

will you ha' the truth on t If this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o' Christian burial

why there thou sayest and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian Come my spade There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners ditchers and grave-makers they hold up Adam's profession

was he a gentleman

a' was the first that ever bore arms

why he had none

what art a heathen How dost thou understand the Scripture The Scripture says Adam digged could be dig without arms
I'll put another question to thee if thou answerest me not to the purpose confess thyself

go to

what is he that builds stronger than either the mason the shipwright or the carpenter


I like thy wit well in good faith the gallows does well but how does it well it does well to those that do ill now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church argal the gallows may do well to thee
to t again come

who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a carpenter

ay tell me that and unyoke

marry now I can tell

to t

mass I cannot tell


cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating and when you are asked this question next say a grave-maker the houses that he makes last till doomsday Go get thee to Yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor

first Clown digs and sings

methought it was very sweet
to contract O the time for-a my behove
O methought there was nothing meet


has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave-making

custom hath made it in him a property of easiness

'Tis e'en so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense


but age with his stealing steps
hath claw'd me in his clutch
and hath shipped me intil the land
as if I had never been such

that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were Cain's jaw-bone that did the first murder This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o'er-offices one that would circumvent God might it not


or of a courtier which could say Good morrow sweet lord How dost thou good lord This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it might it not

ay my lord

why e'en so and now my Lady Worm's chapless and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade Here's fine revolution an we had the trick to see t Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with em mine ache to think on t


a pick-axe and a spade a spade
for and a shrouding sheet
O a pit of clay for to be made
for such a guest is meet

there's another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer Where be his quiddities now his quillets his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery Hum This fellow might be in s time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures The very conveyance of his lands will hardly lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha

not a jot more my lord

is not parchment made of sheep-skins


they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that I will speak to this fellow Whose grave's this sir

mine sir

O a pit of clay for to be made
for such a guest is meet


I think it be thine indeed for thou liest in t

you lie out on t sir and therefore it is not yours for my part I do not lie in t and yet it is mine

thou dost lie in t to be in t and say it is thine tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest

'Tis a quick lie sir twill away again from me to you

what man dost thou dig it for


what woman then

for none neither

who is to be buried in t

one that was a woman sir but rest her soul she's dead

how absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us By the Lord Horatio these three years I have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe How long hast thou been a grave-maker

of all the days i' the year I came to t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras

how long is that since

cannot you tell that every fool can tell that it was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into England

ay marry why was he sent into England


why

'Twill not be seen in him there there the men are as mad as he

how came he mad

very strangely they say

how strangely

faith e'en with losing his wits

upon what ground

why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man and boy thirty years

how long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot


why he more than another

why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body Here's a skull now this skull hath lain you i' the earth three-and-twenty years

whose was it

a whoreson mad fellow's it was whose do you think it was

nay I know not

a pestilence on him for a mad rogue a' poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once This same skull sir was Yorick's skull the king's jester

this

e'en that

let me see


what's that my lord

dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth

e'en so

and smelt so pah


e'en so my lord

to what base uses we may return Horatio Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole

'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so

no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus Alexander died Alexander was buried Alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel

imperious C sar dead and turn'd to clay
O that that earth which kept the world in awe
should patch a wall to expal the winter's flaw

but soft but soft aside here comes the king

the queen the courtiers who is that they follow
and with such maimed rites This doth betoken
the corse they follow did with desperate hand
fordo its own life twas of some estate
couch we awhile and mark

what ceremony else

that is Laertes
a very noble youth mark

what ceremony else

her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
and but that great command o'ersways the order
she should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants
her maiden strewments and the bringing home
of bell and burial

must there no more be done

no more be done
we should profane the service of the dead
to sing a requiem and such rest to her
as to peace-parted souls

lay her i' the earth
and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring I tell thee churlish priest
a ministering angel shall my sister be

what the fair Ophelia

sweets to the sweet farewell

I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd sweet maid
and not have strew'd thy grave

O treble woe
fall ten times treble on that cursed head
whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
depriv'd thee of Hold off the earth awhile
till I have caught her once more in mine arms

now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
till of this flat a mountain you have made
to o'er-top old Pelion or the skyish head
of blue Olympus
what is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers this is I
Hamlet the Dane


the devil take thy soul


thou pray'st not well
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat
for though I am not splenetive and rash
yet have I in me something dangerous
which let thy wisdom fear Away thy hand

pluck them asunder

Hamlet Hamlet
gentlemen

good my lord be quiet


why I will fight with him upon this theme
until my eyelids will no longer wag

O my son what theme

I lov'd Ophelia forty thousand brothers
could not with all their quantity of love
make up my sum What wilt thou do for her

O he is mad Laertes

for love of God forbear him

'Swounds show me what thou'lt do
woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile
I'll do't Dost thou come here to whine
to outface me with leaping in her grave
be buried quick with her and so will I
and if thou prate of mountains let them throw
millions of acres on us till our ground
singeing his pate against the burning zone
make Ossa like a wart Nay an thou'lt mouth
I'll rant as well as thou

this is mere madness
and thus a while the fit will work on him
anon as patient as the female dove
when that her golden couplets are disclos'd
his silence will sit drooping

hear you sir
what is the reason that you use me thus
I lov'd you ever but it is no matter
the cat will mew and dog will have his day


I pray you good Horatio wait upon him

strengthen your patience in our last night's speech
we'll put the matter to the present push
good Gertrude set some watch over your son
this grave shall have a living monument
an hour of quiet shortly shall we see
till then in patience our proceeding be


so much for this sir now shall you see the other
you do remember all the circumstance

remember it my lord

sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
worse than the mutines in the bilboes Rashly
and prais'd be rashness for it let us know
our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us
there's a divinity that shapes our ends
rough-hew them how we will

that is most certain

up from my cabin
my sea-gown scarf'd about me in the dark
grop'd I to find out them had my desire
finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again making so bold
my fears forgetting manners to unseal
their grand commission where I found Horatio
O royal knavery an exact command
larded with many several sorts of reasons
importing Denmark's health and England's too
that on the supervise no leisure bated
no not to stay the grinding of the axe
my head should be struck off

is t possible

here's the commission read it at more leisure
but wilt thou hear me how I did proceed

I beseech you

being thus be-netted round with villanies
ere I could make a prologue to my brains
they had begun the play I sat me down
devis'd a new commission wrote it fair
I once did hold it as our statists do
a baseness to write fair and labour'd much
how to forget that learning but sir now
it did me yeoman's service Wilt thou know

ay good my lord

an earnest conjuration from the king
as England was his faithful tributary
as love between them like the palm should flourish
as peace should still her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma tween their amities
and many such-like As'es of great charge
that on the view and knowing of these contents
without debatement further more or less
he should the bearers put to sudden death
not shriving-time allow'd

how was this seal'd

why even in that was heaven ordinant
I had my father's signet in my purse
which was the model of that Danish seal
subscrib'd it gave't th' impression plac'd it safely
the changeling never known Now the next day
was our sea-fight and what to this was sequent
thou know'st already

so Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to t

why man they did make love to this employment
they are not near my conscience their defeat
does by their own insinuation grow
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
between the pass and fell-incensed points
of mighty opposites

why what a king is this

does it not thinks't thee stand me now upon
he that hath kill'd my king and whor'd my mother
popp'd in between the election and my hopes
and with such cozenage is t not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm and is t not to be damn'd
to let this canker of our nature come
in further evil

it must be shortly known to him from England
what is the issue of the business there

it will be short the interim is mine
and a man's life's no more than to say One
but I am very sorry good Horatio
that to Laertes I forgot myself
for by the image of my cause I see
the portraiture of his I'll count his favours
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me
into a towering passion

peace who comes here

your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark

I humbly thank you sir

dost know this water-fly

no my good lord

thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him He hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess tis a chough but as I say spacious in the possession of dirt

sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart a thing to you from his majesty

I will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit Your bonnet to his right use tis for the head

I thank your lordship tis very hot

no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly

it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion

exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as twere I cannot tell how But my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head Sir this is the matter

I beseech you remember


nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see

sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail But in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more

your lordship speaks most infallibly of him

the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath

sir

is t not possible to understand in another tongue You will do t sir really


of Laertes

his purse is empty already all s golden words are spent

of him sir

I know you are not ignorant

I would you did sir in faith if you did it would not much approve me Well sir

you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is

I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself

I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he's unfellowed

what's his weapon


that's two of his weapons but well

the king sir hath wagered with him six Barbary horses against the which he has imponed as I take it six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit

what call you the carriages

I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done

the carriages sir are the hangers

the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then But on six Barbary horses against six French swords their assigns and three liberal-conceited carriages that's the French bet against the Danish Why is this imponed as you call it

the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer

how if I answer no

I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial


shall I re-deliver you so

to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will

I commend my duty to your lordship

yours yours

he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for s turn

this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head

he did comply with his dug before he sucked it Thus has he and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out


my lord his majesty commended him to you by young Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time

I am constant to my purposes they follow the king's pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided I be so able as now
the king and queen and all are coming down

in happy time

the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play

she well instructs me


you will lose this wager my lord

I do not think so since he went into France I have been in continual practice I shall win at the odds But thou wouldst not think how ill all s here about my heart but it is no matter

nay good my lord

it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman

if your mind dislike any thing obey it I will forestal their repair hither and say you are not fit



come Hamlet come and take this hand from me


give me your pardon sir I've done you wrong
but pardon t as you are a gentleman
this presence knows
and you must needs have heard how I am punish'd
with sore distraction What I have done
that might your nature honour and exception
roughly awake I here proclaim was madness
was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes Never Hamlet
if Hamlet from himself be ta'en away
and when he's not himself does wrong Laertes
then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it
who does it then His madness If t be so
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd
his madness is poor Hamlet's enemy
let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
free me so far in your most generous thoughts
that I have shot mine arrow o'er the house
and hurt my brother

I am satisfied in nature
whose motive in this case should stir me most
to my revenge but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof and will no reconcilement
till by some elder masters of known honour
I have a voice and precedent of peace
to keep my name ungor'd But till that time
I do receive your offer'd love like love
and will not wrong it

I embrace it freely
and will this brother's wager frankly play
give us the foils Come on


I'll be your foil Laertes in mine ignorance
your skill shall like a star i' the darkest night
stick fiery off indeed

you mock me sir

no by this hand

give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet
you know the wager

very well my lord
your Grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side

I do not fear it I have seen you both
but since he is better'd we have therefore odds

this is too heavy let me see another
this likes me well These foils have all a length

ay my good lord


set me the stoups of wine upon that table
if Hamlet give the first or second hit
or quit in answer of the third exchange
let all the battlements their ordnance fire
the king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath
and in the cup an union shall he throw
richer than that which four successive kings
in Denmark's crown have worn Give me the cups
and let the kettle to the trumpet speak
the trumpet to the cannoneer without
the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth
'Now the king drinks to Hamlet Come begin
and you the judges bear a wary eye


come my lord


one

no

judgment

a hit a very palpable hit

well again

stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine
here's to thy health Give him the cup


I'll play this bout first set it by awhile

another hit what say you

a touch a touch I do confess

our son shall win

he's fat and scant of breath
here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
the queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet

good madam

Gertrude do not drink

I will my lord I pray you pardon me

it is the poison'd cup it is too late


come let me wipe thy face

my lord I'll hit him now

I do not think t

and yet tis almost gainst my conscience

come for the third Laertes You but dally
I pray you pass with your best violence
I am afeard you make a wanton of me

say you so come on


nothing neither way

have at you now

part them they are incens'd

nay come again


look to the queen there ho

they bleed on both sides How is it my lord

how is it Laertes

why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery

how does the queen

she swounds to see them bleed

the drink the drink I am poison'd


O villany Ho let the door be lock'd
treachery seek it out


it is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain
no medicine in the world can do thee good
in thee there is not half an hour of life
the treacherous instrument is in thy hand
unbated and envenom'd The foul practice
hath turn'd itself on me lo here I lie
never to rise again Thy mother's poison'd
I can no more The king the king's to blame

the point envenom'd tool
then venom to thy work

treason treason

O yet defend me friends I am but hurt

here thou incestuous murderous damned Dane
drink off this potion is thy union here
follow my mother


he is justly serv'd
it is a poison temper'd by himself
exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
mine and my father's death come not upon thee
nor thine on me


heaven make thee free of it I follow thee
I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu
you that look pale and tremble at this chance
had I but time as this fell sergeant death
is strict in his arrest O I could tell you
but let it be Horatio I am dead
thou liv'st report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied

never believe it
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
here's yet some liquor left

as thou'rt a man
give me the cup let go by heaven I'll have t
O God Horatio what a wounded name
things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
absent thee from felicity awhile
and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
to tell my story


young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland
to the ambassadors of England gives
this war-like volley

O I die Horatio
the potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit
I cannot live to hear the news from England
but I do prophesy the election lights
on Fortinbras he has my dying voice
so tell him with the occurrents more and less
which have solicited The rest is silence


now cracks a noble heart Good-night sweet prince
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
why does the drum come hither

where is this sight
what is it ye would see
if aught of woe or wonder cease your search

this quarry cries on havoc O proud death
what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
that thou so many princes at a shot
so bloodily hast struck

the sight is dismal
and our affairs from England come too late
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing
to tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
where should we have our thanks

not from his mouth
had it the ability of life to thank you
he never gave commandment for their death
but since so jump upon this bloody question
are here arriv'd give order that these bodies
high on a stage be placed to the view
and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
how these things came about so shall you hear
of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
of accidental judgments casual slaughters
of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause
and in this upshot purposes mistook
fall'n on the inventors' heads all this can I
truly deliver

let us haste to hear it
and call the noblest to the audience
for me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
which now to claim my vantage doth invite me

of that I shall have also cause to speak
and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance
on plots and errors happen

let four captains
bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
for he was likely had he been put on
to have prov'd most royally and for his passage
the soldiers' music and the rites of war
speak loudly for him
take up the bodies such a sight as this
becomes the field but here shows much amiss
go bid the soldiers shoot

JULIUS CAESAR

hence home you idle creatures get you home
is this a holiday What know you not
being mechanical you ought not walk
upon a labouring day without the sign

why sir a carpenter

where is thy leather apron and thy rule
what dost thou with thy best apparel on
you sir what trade are you

truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but as you would say a cobbler

but what trade art thou Answer me directly

a trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles

what trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade

nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir I can mend you

what meanest thou by that Mend me thou saucy fellow


thou art a cobbler art thou

truly sir all that I live by is with the awl I meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's matters but with awl I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger I recover them As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork

but wherefore art not in thy shop to-day
why dost thou lead these men about the streets

truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work But indeed sir we make holiday to see C sar and to rejoice in his triumph

wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
what tributaries follow him to Rome
to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
have you climb'd up to walls and battlements
to towers and windows yea to chimney-tops
your infants in your arms and there have sat
to see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
and when you saw his chariot but appear
have you not made a universal shout
that Tiber trembled underneath her banks
to hear the replication of your sounds
made in her concave shores
and do you now put on your best attire
and do you now cull out a holiday
and do you now strew flowers in his way
that comes in triumph over Pompey's blood
be gone
run to your houses fall upon your knees
pray to the gods to intermit the plague
that needs must light on this ingratitude

go go good countrymen and for this fault
assemble all the poor men of your sort
draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
into the channel till the lowest stream

see whe'r their basest metal be not mov'd
they vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness
go you down that way towards the Capitol
this way will I Disrobe the images
if you do find them deck'd with ceremonies

may we do so
you know it is the feast of Lupercal

it is no matter let no images
be hung with C sar's trophies I'll about
and drive away the vulgar from the streets
so do you too where you perceive them thick
these growing feathers pluck'd from C sar's wing
will make him fly an ordinary pitch
who else would soar above the view of men
and keep us all in servile fearfulness

Calphurnia

peace ho C sar speaks


Calphurnia

here my lord

stand you directly in Antonius' way
when he doth run his course Antonius

C sar my lord

forget not in your speed Antonius
to touch Calphurnia for our elders say
the barren touched in this holy chase
shake off their sterile curse

when C sar says Do this it is perform'd

set on and leave no ceremony out


C sar

ha Who calls

bid every noise be still peace yet again


who is it in the press that calls on me
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
cry C sar Speak C sar is turn'd to hear

beware the ides of March

what man is that
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March

set him before me let me see his face

fellow come from the throng look upon C sar

what sayst thou to me now Speak once again

beware the ides of March

he is a dreamer let us leave him pass


will you go see the order of the course

not I

I pray you do

of that quick spirit that is in Antony
let me not hinder Cassius your desires
I'll leave you

Brutus I do observe you now of late
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
and show of love as I was wont to have
you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
over your friend that loves you

Cassius
be not deceiv'd if I have veil'd my look
I turn the trouble of my countenance
merely upon myself Vexed I am
of late with passions of some difference
conceptions only proper to myself
which give some soil perhaps to my behaviours
but let not therefore my good friends be griev'd
among which number Cassius be you one
than that poor Brutus with himself at war
forgets the shows of love to other men

then Brutus I have much mistook your passion
by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
tell me good Brutus can you see your face

no Cassius for the eye sees not itself
but by reflection by some other things

'Tis just
and it is very much lamented Brutus
that you have no such mirrors as will turn
your hidden worthiness into your eye
that you might see your shadow I have heard
where many of the best respect in Rome
except immortal C sar speaking of Brutus
and groaning underneath this age's yoke

into what dangers would you lead me Cassius
that you would have me seek into myself
for that which is not in me

therefore good Brutus be prepar'd to hear
and since you know you cannot see yourself
so well as by reflection I your glass
will modestly discover to yourself
that of yourself which you yet know not of
and be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
were I a common laugher or did use
to stale with ordinary oaths my love
to every new protester if you know
that I do fawn on men and hug them hard
and after scandal them or if you know
that I profess myself in banqueting
to all the rout then hold me dangerous

what means this shouting I do fear the people
choose C sar for their king

ay do you fear it
then must I think you would not have it so

I would not Cassius yet I love him well
but wherefore do you hold me here so long
what is it that you would impart to me
if it be aught toward the general good
set honour in one eye and death i' the other
and I will look on both indifferently
for let the gods so speed me as I love
the name of honour more than I fear death

I know that virtue to be in you Brutus
as well as I do know your outward favour
well honour is the subject of my story
I cannot tell what you and other men
I had as lief not be as live to be
in awe of such a thing as I myself
I was born free as C sar so were you
we both have fed as well and we can both
endure the winter's cold as well as he
for once upon a raw and gusty day
the troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
C sar said to me Dar'st thou Cassius now
leap in with me into this angry flood
and swim to yonder point Upon the word
accoutred as I was I plunged in
and bade him follow so indeed he did
the torrent roar'd and we did buffet it
with lusty sinews throwing it aside
and stemming it with hearts of controversy
but ere we could arrive the point propos'd
C sar cried Help me Cassius or I sink
I as neas our great ancestor
did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
did I the tired C sar And this man
is now become a god and Cassius is
a wretched creature and must bend his body
if C sar carelessly but nod on him
he had a fever when he was in Spain
and when the fit was on him I did mark
how he did shake tis true this god did shake
his coward lips did from their colour fly
and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
did lose his lustre I did hear him groan
ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
mark him and write his speeches in their books
alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius
as a sick girl Ye gods it doth amaze me
a man of such a feeble temper should
so get the start of the majestic world
and bear the palm alone


I do believe that these applauses are
for some new honours that are heaped on C sar

why man he doth bestride the narrow world
like a Colossus and we petty men
walk under his huge legs and peep about
to find ourselves dishonourable graves
men at some time are masters of their fates
the fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
but in ourselves that we are underlings
Brutus and C sar what should be in that C sar
why should that name be sounded more than yours
write them together yours is as fair a name
sound them it doth become the mouth as well
weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em
'Brutus' will start a spirit as soon as C sar
now in the names of all the gods at once
upon what meat doth this our C sar feed
that he is grown so great Age thou art sham'd
when went there by an age since the great flood
but it was fam'd with more than with one man
when could they say till now that talk'd of Rome
that her wide walls encompass'd but one man
now is it Rome indeed and room enough
when there is in it but one only man
O you and I have heard our fathers say
there was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
as easily as a king

that you do love me I am nothing jealous
what you would work me to I have some aim
how I have thought of this and of these times
I shall recount hereafter for this present
I would not so with love I might entreat you
be any further mov'd What you have said
I will consider what you have to say
I will with patience hear and find a time
till then my noble friend chew upon this
Brutus had rather be a villager
than to repute himself a son of Rome
under these hard conditions as this time
is like to lay upon us

I am glad
that my weak words have struck but thus much show
of fire from Brutus

the games are done and C sar is returning

as they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
and he will after his sour fashion tell you
what hath proceeded worthy note to-day


I will do so But look you Cassius
the angry spot doth glow on C sar's brow
Calphurnia's cheek is pale and Cicero
looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
as we have seen him in the Capitol
being cross'd in conference by some senators

Casca will tell us what the matter is

Antonius

C sar

let me have men about me that are fat
sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights
yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
he thinks too much such men are dangerous

fear him not C sar he's not dangerous
he is a noble Roman and well given

yet if my name were liable to fear
I do not know the man I should avoid
so soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
he is a great observer and he looks
quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
as thou dost Antony he hears no music
seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
as if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
that could be mov'd to smile at any thing
such men as he be never at heart's ease
whiles they behold a greater than themselves
and therefore are they very dangerous
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
than what I fear for always I am C sar
come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
and tell me truly what thou think'st of him


you pull'd me by the cloak would you speak with me
ay Casca tell us what hath chanc'd to-day
that C sar looks so sad

why you were with him were you not

I should not then ask Casca what had chanc'd

why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a-shouting

what was the second noise for

why for that too

they shouted thrice what was the last cry for

why for that too

was the crown offered him thrice


who offered him the crown

why Antony

tell us the manner of it gentle Casca

I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronets and as I told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement shouted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because C sar refused the crown that it had almost choked C sar for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air

but soft I pray you what did C sar swound

he fell down in the market-place and foamed at mouth and was speechless

'Tis very like he hath the falling-sickness

no C sar hath it not but you and I And honest Casca we have the falling-sickness

I know not what you mean by that but I am sure C sar fell down If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre I am no true man


marry before he fell down when he perceiv'd the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut An I had been a man of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I might go to hell among the rogues And so he fell When he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity Three or four wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but there's no head to be taken of them if C sar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less

and after that he came thus sad away

ay

did Cicero say any thing

ay he spoke Greek

to what effect

nay an I tell you that I'll ne'er look you i' the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs off C sar's images are put to silence Fare you well There was more foolery yet if I could remember it

will you sup with me to-night Casca

no I am promised forth


ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating

good I will expect you

do so Farewell both


what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
he was quick mettle when he went to school

so is he now in execution
of any bold or noble enterprise
however he puts on this tardy form
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
which gives men stomach to digest his words
with better appetite

and so it is For this time I will leave you
I will come home to you or if you will
come home to me and I will wait for you

I will do so till then think of the world

well Brutus thou art noble yet I see
thy honourable metal may be wrought
from that it is dispos'd therefore tis meet
that noble minds keep ever with their likes
for who so firm that cannot be seduc'd
C sar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
if I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
he should not humour me I will this night
in several hands in at his windows throw
as if they came from several citizens
writings all tending to the great opinion
that Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
C sar's ambition shall be glanced at
and after this let C sar seat him sure


good even Casca brought you C sar home
why are you breathless and why stare you so

are not you mov'd when all the sway of earth
shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
have riv'd the knotty oaks and I have seen
the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
to be exalted with the threat'ning clouds
but never till to-night never till now
did I go through a tempest dropping fire
either there is a civil strife in heaven
or else the world too saucy with the gods
incenses them to send destruction

why saw you any thing more wonderful

held up his left hand which did flame and burn
like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand
not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd
besides I have not since put up my sword
against the Capitol I met a hon
who glar'd upon me and went surly by
without annoying me and there were drawn
upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
transformed with their fear who swore they saw
men all in fire walk up and down the streets
and yesterday the bird of night did sit
even at noon-day upon the market-place
hooting and shrieking When these prodigies
do so conjointly meet let not men say
'These are their reasons they are natural
for I believe they are portentous things
unto the climate that they point upon

indeed it is a strange-disposed time
clean from the purpose of the things themselves
comes C sar to the Capitol to-morrow

he doth for he did bid Antonius
send word to you he would be there to-morrow

good-night then Casca this disturbed sky
is not to walk in

farewell Cicero

who's there

a Roman

Casca by your voice

your ear is good Cassius what night is this


who ever knew the heavens menace so

those that have known the earth so full of faults
for my part I have walk'd about the streets
submitting me unto the perilous night
and thus unbraced Casca as you see
have bar'd my bosom to the thunder-stone
and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
the breast of heaven I did present myself
even in the aim and very flash of it

but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
it is the part of men to fear and tremble
when the most mighty gods by tokens send
such dreadful heralds to astonish us

you are dull Casca and those sparks of life
that should be in a Roman you do want
and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
to see the strange impatience of the heavens
but if you would consider the true cause
why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
why birds and beasts from quality and kind
why old men fools and children calculate
why all these things change from their ordinance
their natures and pre-formed faculties
to monstrous quality why you shall find
that heaven hath infus'd them with these spirits
to make them instruments of fear and warning
unto some monstrous state
now could I Casca name to thee a man
most like this dreadful night
that thunders lightens opens graves and roars
as doth the lion in the Capitol
a man no mightier than thyself or me
in personal action yet prodigious grown
and fearful as these strange eruptions are
'Tis C sar that you mean is it not Cassius

let it be who it is for Romans now
have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
but woe the while our fathers' minds are dead
and we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish

indeed they say the senators to-morrow
mean to establish C sar as a king
and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
in every place save here in Italy

I know where I will wear this dagger then
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
but life being weary of those worldly bars
never lacks power to dismiss itself
if I know this know all the world besides
that part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure


so can I
so every bondman in his own hand bears
the power to cancel his captivity

and why should C sar be a tyrant then
poor man I know he would not be a wolf
but that he sees the Romans are but sheep
he were no lion were not Romans hinds
those that with haste will make a mighty fire
begin it with weak straws what trash is Rome
what rubbish and what offal when it serves
for the base matter to illuminate
where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
before a willing bondman then I know
my answer must be made but I am arm'd
and dangers are to me indifferent

you speak to Casca and to such a man
that is no fleering tell-tale Hold my hand
be factious for redress of all these griefs
and I will set this foot of mine as far
as who goes furthest

there's a bargain made
now know you Casca I have mov'd already
some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
to undergo with me an enterprise
of honourable-dangerous consequence
and I do know by this they stay for me
in Pompey's porch for now this fearful night
there is no stir or walking in the streets
in favour's like the work we have in hand
most bloody fiery and most terrible

stand close awhile for here comes one in haste

'Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait
he is a friend

Cinna where haste you so

to find out you Who's that Metellus Cimber

no it is Casca one incorporate
to our attempts Am I not stay'd for Cinna

I am glad on t What a fearful night is this
there's two or three of us have seen strange sights

am I not stay'd for Tell me
yes you are
O Cassius if you could
but win the noble Brutus to our party

be you content Good Cinna take this paper
and look you lay it in the pr tor's chair
where Brutus may but find it and throw this
in at his window set this up with wax
upon old Brutus' statue all this done
repair to Pompey's porch where you shall find us
is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there

all but Metellus Cimber and he's gone
to seek you at your house Well I will hie
and so bestow these papers as you bade me

that done repair to Pompey's theatre

come Casca you and I will yet ere day
is ours already and the man entire
upon the next encounter yields him ours

O he sits high in all the people's hearts
and that which would appear offence in us
his countenance like richest alchemy
will change to virtue and to worthiness

him and his worth and our great need of him
you have right well conceited Let us go
for it is after midnight and ere day
we will awake him and be sure of him

what Lucius ho
I cannot by the progress of the stars
give guess how near to day Lucius I say
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
when Lucius when Awake I say what Lucius

call'd you my lord

get me a taper in my study Lucius
when it is lighted come and call me here

I will my lord


it must be by his death and for my part
I know no personal cause to spurn at him
but for the general He would be crown'd
how that might change his nature there's the question
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder
and that craves wary walking Crown him that
and then I grant we put a sting in him
that at his will he may do danger with
the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
remorse from power and to speak truth of C sar
I have not known when his affections sway'd
that lowliness is young ambition's ladder
whereto the climber-upward turns his face
but when he once attains the upmost round
he then unto the ladder turns his back
looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend So C sar may
then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
will bear no colour for the thing he is
fashion it thus that what he is augmented
would run to these and these extremities
and therefore think him as a serpent's egg
which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous
and kill him in the shell


the taper burneth in your closet sir
searching the window for a flint I found
this paper thus seal'd up and I am sure
it did not lie there when I went to bed
get you to bed again it is not day
is not to-morrow boy the ides of March

I know not sir

look in the calendar and bring me word

I will sir


the exhalations whizzing in the air
give so much light that I may read by them

Brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself
shall Rome &c Speak strike redress
Brutus thou sleep'st awake
such instigations have been often dropp'd
where I have took them up
'Shall Rome &c Thus must I piece it out
my ancestors did from the streets of Rome
the Tarquin drive when he was call'd a king
'Speak strike redress Am I entreated
to speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
if the redress will follow thou receiv'st
thy full petition at the hand of Brutus


sir March is wasted fourteen days


'Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks

since Cassius first did whet me against C sar
I have not slept
between the acting of a dreadful thing
and the first motion all the interim is
like a phantasma or a hideous dream
the genius and the mortal instruments
like to a little kingdom suffers then
the nature of an insurrection


sir tis your brother Cassius at the door
who doth desire to see you

is he alone

no sir there are more with him

do you know them

no sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears
and half their faces buried in their cloaks
that by no means I may discover them
by any mark of favour

let em enter
they are the faction O conspiracy
sham'st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
when evils are most free O then by day
where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
to mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracy
hide it in smiles and affability
for if thou path thy native semblance on
not Erebus itself were dim enough
to hide thee from prevention


I think we are too bold upon your rest
good morrow Brutus do we trouble you

I have been up this hour awake all night
know I these men that come along with you

yes every man of them and no man here
but honours you and every one doth wish
which every noble Roman bears of you
this is Trebonius

he is welcome hither

this Decius Brutus

he is welcome too

this Casca this Cinna
and this Metellus Cimber

they are all welcome
what watchful cares do interpose themselves
betwixt your eyes and night

shall I entreat a word



no

O pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines
that fret the clouds are messengers of day

you shall confess that you are both deceiv'd
here as I point my sword the sun arises
which is a great way growing on the south
weighing the youthful season of the year
some two months hence up higher toward the north
he first presents his fire and the high east
stands as the Capitol directly here

give me your hands all over one by one

and let us swear our resolution

no not an oath if not the face of men
if these be motives weak break off betimes
and every man hence to his idle bed
so let high-sighted tyranny range on
till each man-drop by lottery But if these
as I am sure they do bear fire enough
to kindle cowards and to steel with valour
the melting spirits of women then countrymen
what need we any spur but our own cause
to prick us to redress what other bond
than secret Romans that have spoke the word
and will not palter and what other oath
than honesty to honesty engag'd
that this shall be or we will fall for it
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
the even virtue of our enterprise
nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits
did need an oath when every drop of blood
that every Roman bears and nobly bears
is guilty of a several bastardy
if he do break the smallest particle
of any promise that hath pass'd from him

but what of Cicero Shall we sound him
I think he will stand very strong with us

let us not leave him out

no by no means

O let us have him for his silver hairs
will purchase us a good opinion
and buy men's voices to commend our deeds
it shall be said his judgment rul'd our hands
our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
but all be buried in his gravity
O name him not let us not break with him
for he will never follow any thing
that other men begin

then leave him out

indeed he is not fit

shall no man else be touch'd but only C sar

Decius well urg'd I think it is not meet
mark Antony so well belov'd of C sar
should outlive C sar we shall find of him
a shrewd contriver and you know his means
if he improve them may well stretch so far
as to annoy us all which to prevent
let Antony and C sar fall together

our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
like wrath in death and envy afterwards
for Antony is but a limb of C sar
let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
we all stand up against the spirit of C sar
and in the spirit of men there is no blood
O then that we could come by C sar's spirit
and not dismember C sar But alas
C sar must bleed for it And gentle friends
let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully
let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
and let our hearts as subtle masters do
stir up their servants to an act of rage
and after seem to chide em This shall make
our purpose necessary and not envious
which so appearing to the common eyes
we shall be call'd purgers not murderers
and for Mark Antony think not of him
for he can do no more than C sar's arm

yet I fear him
for in the engrafted love he bears to C sar

alas good Cassius do not think of him
if he love C sar all that he can do
is to himself take thought and die for C sar
and that were much he should for he is given
to sports to wildness and much company

there is no fear in him let him not die
for he will live and laugh at this hereafter


peace count the clock

the clock hath stricken three

'Tis time to part
but it is doubtful yet
whether C sar will come forth to-day or no
for he is superstitious grown of late
quite from the main opinion he held once
of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
it may be these apparent prodigies
the unaccustom'd terror of this night
and the persuasion of his augurers
may hold him from the Capitol to-day

never fear that if he be so resolv'd
I can o'ersway him for he loves to hear
that unicorns may be betray'd with trees
and bears with glasses elephants with holes
lions with toils and men with flatterers
but when I tell him he hates flatterers
he says he does being then most flattered
let me work
for I can give his humour the true bent

nay we will all of us be there to fetch him

by the eighth hour is that the uttermost

be that the uttermost and fail not then

Caius Ligarius doth bear C sar hard
who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder none of you have thought of him

now good Metellus go along by him
he loves me well and I have given him reasons
send him but hither and I'll fashion him

the morning comes upon s we'll leave you Brutus
and friends disperse yourselves but all remember
what you have said and show yourselves true Romans

let not our looks put on our purposes
but bear it as our Roman actors do
with untir'd spirits and formal constancy
and so good morrow to you every one

boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter
enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
which busy care draws in the brains of men
therefore thou sleep'st so sound


Brutus my lord

Portia what mean you Wherefore rise you now
it is not for your health thus to commit
your weak condition to the raw cold morning

nor for yours neither You've ungently Brutus
you suddenly arose and walk'd about
musing and sighing with your arms across
and when I ask'd you what the matter was
you star'd upon me with ungentle looks
I urg'd you further then you scratch'd your head
and too impatiently stamp'd with your foot
yet I insisted yet you answer'd not
but with an angry wafture of your hand
gave sign for me to leave you So I did
fearing to strengthen that impatience
which seem'd too much enkindled and withal
hoping it was but an effect of humour
which sometime hath his hour with every man
it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
and could it work so much upon your shape
as it hath much prevail'd on your condition
I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
make me acquainted with your cause of grief


Brutus is wise and were he not in health
he would embrace the means to come by it

why so I do Good Portia go to bed

is Brutus sick and is it physical
to walk unbraced and suck up the humours
of the dank morning What is Brutus sick
and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
to dare the vile contagion of the night
and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
to add unto his sickness No my Brutus
you have some sick offence within your mind
which by the right and virtue of my place
I ought to know of and upon my knees
I charm you by my once-commended beauty
by all your vows of love and that great vow
which did incorporate and make us one
why are you heavy and what men to-night
have had resort to you for here have been
some six or seven who did hide their faces
even from darkness

kneel not gentle Portia

I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
is it excepted I should know no secrets
that appertain to you Am I yourself
but as it were in sort of limitation
to keep with you at meals comfort your bed
and talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
of your good pleasure If it be no more
Portia is Brutus' harlot not his wife

you are my true and honourable wife
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops

if this were true then should I know this secret
I grant I am a woman but withal
a woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
I grant I am a woman but withal
a woman well-reputed Cato's daughter
think you I am no stronger than my sex
being so father'd and so husbanded
tell me your counsels I will not disclose em
I have made strong proof of my constancy
giving myself a voluntary wound
here in the thigh can I bear that with patience
and not my husband's secrets

O ye gods
render me worthy of this noble wife

hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile
and by and by thy bosom shall partake
all my engagements I will construe to thee
all the charactery of my sad brows
leave me with haste

Lucius who's that knocks


here is a sick man that would speak with you

Caius Ligarius that Metellus spoke of
boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how

vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue

O what a time have you chose out brave Caius
to wear a kerchief Would you were not sick

I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
any exploit worthy the name of honour
such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius
had you a healthful ear to hear of it

by all the gods that Romans bow before
I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome
brave son deriv'd from honourable loins
thou like an exorcist hast conjur'd up
my mortified spirit Now bid me run
and I will strive with things impossible
yea get the better of them What's to do

a piece of work that will make sick men whole

but are not some whole that we must make sick

that must we also What it is my Caius
I shall unfold to thee as we are going
to whom it must be done

and with a heart new-fir'd I follow you
to do I know not what but it sufficeth
that Brutus leads me on

follow me then


nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night
thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out
'Help ho They murder C sar Who's within


my lord

go bid the priests do present sacrifice
and bring me their opinions of success

I will my lord

you shall not stir out of your house to-day

C sar shall forth the things that threaten'd me
ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see
the face of C sar they are vanished

C sar I never stood on ceremonies
yet now they fright me There is one within
besides the things that we have heard and seen
recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
a lioness hath whelped in the streets
and graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead
fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
in ranks and squadrons and right form of war
which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
the noise of battle hurtled in the air
horses did neigh and dying men did groan
and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
O C sar these things are beyond all use

what can be avoided
whose end is purpos'd by the mighty gods
yet C sar shall go forth for these predictions
are to the world in general as to C sar

when beggars die there are no comets seen
the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes

cowards die many times before their deaths
the valiant never taste of death but once
of all the wonders that I yet have heard
it seems to me most strange that men should fear
seeing that death a necessary end
will come when it will come

what say the augurers

they would not have you to stir forth to-day
they could not find a heart within the beast

the gods do this in shame of cowardice
C sar should be a beast without a heart
if he should stay at home to-day for fear
no C sar shall not danger knows full well
that C sar is more dangerous than he
we are two lions litter'd in one day
and I the elder and more terrible
and C sar shall go forth

alas my lord
your wisdom is consum'd in confidence
do not go forth to-day call it my fear
that keeps you in the house and not your own
we'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house
and he shall say you are not well to-day
let me upon my knee prevail in this

and for thy humour I will stay at home

here's Decius Brutus he shall tell them so

C sar all hail Good morrow worthy C sar
I come to fetch you to the senate-house

and you are come in very happy time
to bear my greeting to the senators
and tell them that I will not come to-day
cannot is false and that I dare not falser
I will not come to-day tell them so Decius

say he is sick

shall C sar send a lie
have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
Decius go tell them C sar will not come
most mighty C sar let me know some cause
lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so

the cause is in my will I will not come
that is enough to satisfy the senate
but for your private satisfaction
because I love you I will let you know
Calphurnia here my wife stays me at home
she dreamt to-night she saw my statua
which like a fountain with a hundred spouts
did run pure blood and many lusty Romans
came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
and these does she apply for warnings and portents
and evils imminent and on her knee
hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day

this dream is all amiss interpreted
it was a vision fair and fortunate
your statue spouting blood in many pipes
signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
reviving blood and that great men shall press
for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
this by Calphurnia's dream is signified

and this way have you well expounded it

I have when you have heard what I can say
and know it now the senate have concluded
to give this day a crown to mighty C sar
if you shall send them word you will not come
their minds may change Besides it were a mock
apt to be render'd for some one to say
'Break up the senate till another time
when C sar's wife shall meet with better dreams
if C sar hide himself shall they not whisper
'Lo C sar is afraid
pardon me C sar for my dear dear love
to your proceeding bids me tell you this

how foolish do your fears seem now Calphurnia
I am ashamed I did yield to them
give me my robe for I will go

and look where Publius is come to fetch me

good morrow C sar

welcome Publius
what Brutus are you stirr'd so early too
good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius
C sar was ne'er so much your enemy
as that same ague which hath made you lean
what is't o'clock

C sar tis strucken eight

I thank you for your pains and courtesy

see Antony that revels long o' nights

is notwithstanding up Good morrow Antony

so to most noble C sar

bid them prepare within
I am to blame to be thus waited for
now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius
I have an hour's talk in store for you
remember that you call on me to-day
be near me that I may remember you

C sar I will

and so near will I be
that your best friends shall wish I had been further

and we like friends will straightway go together

that every like is not the same O C sar
the heart of Brutus yearns to think upon


C sar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius There is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against C sar If thou be'st not immortal look about you security gives way to conspiracy The mighty gods defend thee Thy lover
here will I stand till C sar pass along
and as a suitor will I give him this
my heart laments that virtue cannot live
out of the teeth of emulation
if thou read this O C sar thou mayst live
if not the Fates with traitors do contrive


I prithee boy run to the senate-house
stay not to answer me but get thee gone
why dost thou stay


I would have had thee there and here again
ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
O constancy be strong upon my side
set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue
I have a man's mind but a woman's might
how hard it is for women to keep counsel
art thou here yet

madam what shall I do
run to the Capitol and nothing else
and so return to you and nothing else

yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well
for he went sickly forth and take good note
what C sar doth what suitors press to him
hark boy what noise is that

I hear none madam
prithee listen well
I heard a bustling rumour like a fray
and the wind brings it from the Capitol

sooth madam I hear nothing


come hither fellow which way hast thou been

at mine own house good lady

what is t o'clock

about the ninth hour lady

is C sar yet gone to the Capitol

madam not yet I go to take my stand
to see him pass on to the Capitol
thou hast some suit to C sar hast thou not

that I have lady if it will please C sar
to be so good to C sar as to hear me
I shall beseech him to befriend himself

why know'st thou any harm's intended towards him

none that I know will be much that I fear may chance
good morrow to you Here the street is narrow
the throng that follows C sar at the heels
of senators of pr tors common suitors
will crowd a feeble man almost to death
I'll get me to a place more void and there
speak to great C sar as he comes along


I must go in Ay me how weak a thing
the heart of woman is O Brutus
sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit
that C sar will not grant O I grow faint
run Lucius and commend me to my lord
say I am merry come to me again
and bring me word what he doth say to thee

the idea of March are come

ay C sar but not gone

hail C sar Read this schedule

Trebonius doth desire you to o'er-read
at your best leisure this his humble suit

O C sar read mine first for mine's a suit
that touches C sar nearer Read it great C sar

what touches us ourself shall be last serv'd
delay not C sar read it instantly

what is the fellow mad

sirrah give place

what urge you your petitions in the street
come to the Capitol


I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive

what enterprise Popilius

fare you well


what said Popilius Lena

I fear our purpose is discovered

look how he makes to C sar mark him

Casca be sudden for we fear prevention
Brutus what shall be done If this be known
Cassius or C sar never shall turn back
for I will slay myself

Cassius be constant
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes
for look he smiles and C sar doth not change

Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus
he draws Mark Antony out of the way


where is Metellus Cimber Let him go
and presently prefer his suit to C sar
he is address'd press near and second him

Casca you are the first that rears your hand

are we all ready What is now amiss
that C sar and his senate must redress

most high most mighty and most puissant C sar
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
a humble heart


I must prevent thee Cimber
these couchings and these lowly courtesies
might fire the blood of ordinary men
and turn pre-ordinance and first decree
into the law of children Be not fond
to think that C sar bears such rebel blood
that will be thaw'd from the true quality
low-crooked curtsies and base spaniel fawning
thy brother by decree is banished
if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way
know C sar doth not wrong nor without cause
will he be satisfied

is there no voice more worthy than my own
to sound more sweetly in great C sar's ear
for the repealing of my banish'd brother

I kiss thy hand but not in flattery C sar
desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
have an immediate freedom of repeal

what Brutus

pardon C sar C sar pardon
as low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall

I could be well mov'd if I were as you
if I could pray to move prayers would move me
but I am constant as the northern star
of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
there is no fellow in the firmament
the skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks
they are all fire and every one doth shine
but there's but one in all doth hold his place
so in the world tis furnish'd well with men
and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
yet in the number I do know but one
that unassailable holds on his rank
unshak'd of motion and that I am he
let me a little show it even in this
that I was constant Cimber should be banish'd
and constant do remain to keep him so

O C sar
hence Wilt thou lift up Olympus

great C sar

doth not Brutus bootless kneel

speak hands for me


et tu Brute Then fall C sar


liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead
run hence proclaim cry it about the streets

some to the common pulpits and cry out
'Liberty freedom and enfranchisement

people and senators be not affrighted

go to the pulpit Brutus

and Cassius too

where's Publius

here quite confounded with this mutiny

stand fast together lest some friend of C sar's
should chance

talk not of standing Publius good cheer
there is no harm intended to your person
nor to no Roman else so tell them Publius

and leave us Publius lest that the people
rushing on us should do your age some mischief

but we the doers


where's Antony

fled to his house amaz'd
men wives and children stare cry out and run
as it were doomsday

fates we will know your pleasures
that we shall die we know tis but the time
and drawing days out that men stand upon

why he that cuts off twenty years of life
cuts off so many years of fearing death

grant that and then is death a benefit
so are we C sar's friends that have abridg'd
his time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop
up to the elbows and besmear our swords
then walk we forth even to the market-place
and waving our red weapons o'er our heads
let's all cry Peace freedom and liberty

stoop then and wash How many ages hence
shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er
in states unborn and accents yet unknown

how many times shall C sar bleed in sport
that now on Pompey's basis lies along
no worthier than the dust

so oft as that shall be
so often shall the knot of us be call'd
the men that gave their country liberty

what shall we forth

Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
with the most boldest and best hearts of Rome


soft who comes here A friend of Antony's

thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
and being prostrate thus he bade me say
Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
C sar was mighty bold royal and loving
say I love Brutus and I honour him
say I fear'd C sar honour'd him and lov'd him
if Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
may safely come to him and be resolv'd
how C sar hath deserv'd to lie in death
mark Antony shall not love C sar dead
so well as Brutus living but will follow
the fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
with all true faith So says my master Antony

thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
I never thought him worse
tell him so please him come unto this place
he shall be satisfied and by my honour
depart untouch'd

I'll fetch him presently


I know that we shall have him well to friend

I wish we may but yet have I a mind
that fears him much and my misgiving still
falls shrewdly to the purpose


but here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony
O mighty C sar dost thou lie so low
are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well
I know not gentlemen what you intend
who else must be let blood who else is rank
if I myself there is no hour so fit
as C sar's death's hour nor no instrument
of half that worth as those your swords made rich
with the most noble blood of all this world
I do beseech ye if ye bear me hard
now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
fulfil your pleasure Live a thousand years
I shall not find myself so apt to die
no place will please me so no mean of death
as here by C sar and by you cut off
the choice and master spirits of this age

O Antony beg not your death of us
though now we must appear bloody and cruel
you see we do yet see you but our hands
and this the bleeding business they have done
our hearts you see not they are pitiful
and pity to the general wrong of Rome
as fire drives out fire so pity pity
hath done this deed on C sar For your part
to you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
of brothers' temper do receive you in
with all kind love good thoughts and reverence

your voice shall be as strong as any man's
in the disposing of new dignities

only be patient till we have appeas'd
the multitude beside themselves with fear
and then we will deliver you the cause
why I that did love C sar when I struck him
have thus proceeded
I doubt not of your wisdom
let each man render me his bloody hand
first Marcus Brutus will I shake with you
next Caius Cassius do I take your hand
now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus
yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours
though last not least in love yours good Trebonius
gentlemen all alas what shall I say
my credit now stands on such slippery ground
that one of two bad ways you must conceit me
either a coward or a flatterer
that I did love thee C sar O tis true
if then thy spirit look upon us now
shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
to see thy Antony making his peace
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
most noble in the presence of thy corse
had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
in terms of friendship with thine enemies
pardon me Julius Here wast thou bay'd brave hart
here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy leth
O world thou wast the forest to this hart
and this indeed O world the heart of thee
how like a deer strucken by many princes
dost thou here lie

mark Antony

pardon me Caius Cassius
the enemies of C sar shall say this
then in a friend it is cold modesty

I blame you not for praising C sar so
but what compact mean you to have with us
will you be prick'd in number of our friends
or shall we on and not depend on you
therefore I took your hands but was indeed
sway'd from the point by looking down on C sar
friends am I with you all and love you all
upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
why and wherein C sar was dangerous

or else were this a savage spectacle
our reasons are so full of good regard
that were you Antony the son of C sar
you should be satisfied

that's all I seek
and am moreover suitor that I may
produce his body to the market place
and in the pulpit as becomes a friend
speak in the order of his funeral

you shall Mark Antony



you know not what you do do not consent
that Antony speak in his funeral
know you how much the people may be mov'd
by that which he will utter

by your pardon
I will myself into the pulpit first
and show the reason of our C sar's death
what Antony shall speak I will protest
he speaks by leave and by permission
and that we are contented C sar shall
have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
it shall advantage more than do us wrong

I know not what may fall I like it not

mark Antony here take you C sar's body
but speak all good you can devise of C sar
and say you do t by our permission
else shall you not have any hand at all
about his funeral and you shall speak
in the same pulpit whereto I am going
after my speech is ended

be it so
I do desire no more

prepare the body then and follow us


O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
that I am meek and gentle with these butchers
thou art the ruins of the noblest man
that ever lived in the tide of times
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
over thy wounds now do I prophesy
to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
a curse shall light upon the limbs of men
domestic fury and fierce civil strife
shall cumber all the parts of Italy
blood and destruction shall be so in use
and dreadful objects so familiar
that mothers shall but smile when they behold
their infants quarter'd with the hands of war
all pity chok'd with custom of fell deeds
and C sar's spirit ranging for revenge
with Ate by his side come hot from hell
shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war
that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
with carrion men groaning for burial

you serve Octavius C sar do you not

I do Mark Antony
C sar did write for him to come to Rome

he did receive his letters and is coming
and bid me say to you by word of mouth

O C sar

thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
passion I see is catching for mine eyes
seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
began to water Is thy master coming

he lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome

post back with speed and tell him what hath chanc'd
hare is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome
no Rome of safety for Octavius yet
hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile
thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse
in my oration how the people take
the cruel issue of these bloody men
according to the which thou shalt discourse
to young Octavius of the state of things
lead me your hand


we will be satisfied let us be satisfied

then follow me and give me audience friends
Cassius go you into the other street
and part the numbers
those that will hear me speak let em stay here
those that will follow Cassius go with him
and public reasons shall be rendered
of C sar's death

I will hear Brutus speak

when severally we hear them rendered


the noble Brutus is ascended silence

be patient till the last
Romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of C sar's to him I say that Brutus' love to C sar was no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against C sar this is my answer Not that I loved C sar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather C sar were living and die all slaves than that C sar were dead to live all free men As C sar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I slew him There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If any speak for him have I offended I pause for a reply

none Brutus none

then none have I offended I have done no more to C sar than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforced for which he suffered death

here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death

live Brutus live live

bring him with triumph home unto his house

give him a statue with his ancestors
let him be C sar

C sar's better parts
shall be crown'd in Brutus

we'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours

my countrymen

peace silence Brutus speaks

peace ho

good countrymen let me depart alone
and for my sake stay here with Antony
do grace to C sar's corpse and grace his speech
tending to C sar's glories which Mark Antony
by our permission is allow'd to make
I do entreat you not a man depart


stay ho and let us hear Mark Antony

let him go up into the public chair
we'll hear him Noble Antony go up

for Brutus' sake I am beholding to you


what does he say of Brutus

he says for Brutus' sake
he finds himself beholding to us all

'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here

this C sar was a tyrant

we are bless'd that Rome is rid of him

peace let us hear what Antony can say

you gentle Romans

peace ho let us hear him

friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
I come to bury C sar not to praise him
the evil that men do lives after them
the good is oft interred with their bones
so let it be with C sar The noble Brutus
hath told you C sar was ambitious
if it were so it was a grievous fault
and grievously hath C sar answer'd it
here under leave of Brutus and the rest
for Brutus is an honourable man
so are they all all honourable men
he was my friend faithful and just to me
but Brutus says he was ambitious
and Brutus is an honourable man
he hath brought many captives home to Rome
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
did this in C sar seem ambitious
when that the poor have cried C sar hath wept
ambition should be made of sterner stuff
yet Brutus says he was ambitious
and Brutus is an honourable man
you all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown
which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
yet Brutus says he was ambitious
and sure he is an honourable man
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
but here I am to speak what I do know
you all did love him once not without cause
what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
and men have lost their reason Bear with me
my heart is in the coffin there with C sar
and I must pause till it come back to me

methinks there is much reason in his sayings

if thou consider rightly of the matter
C sar has had great wrong

has he masters
I fear there will a worse come in his place

mark'd ye his words He would not take the crown
therefore tis certain he was not ambitious

if it be found so some will dear abide it

poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping


now mark him he begins again to speak

but yesterday the word of C sar might
have stood against the world now lies he there
and none so poor to do him reverence
O masters if I were dispos'd to stir
your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
who you all know are honourable men
I will not do them wrong I rather choose
to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
than I will wrong such honourable men
but here's a parchment with the seal of C sar
I found it in his closet tis his will
let but the commons hear this testament
which pardon me I do not mean to read
and they would go and kiss dead C sar's wounds
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood
and dying mention it within their wills
bequeathing it as a rich legacy
unto their issue

we'll hear the will read it Mark Antony

the will the will we will hear C sar's will

have patience gentle friends I must not read it
it is not meet you know how C sar lov'd you
you are not wood you are not stones but men
and being men hearing the will of C sar
it will inflame you it will make you mad
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs
for if you should O what would come of it

read the will we'll hear it Antony
you shall read us the will C sar's will

I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
I fear I wrong the honourable men
whose daggers have stabb'd C sar I do fear it

they were traitors honourable men

the will the testament

they were villains murderers The will read the will

you will compel me then to read the will
then make a ring about the corpse of C sar
and let me show you him that made the will
shall I descend and will you give me leave

come down

descend

you shall have leave

a ring stand round

stand from the hearse stand from the body

room for Antony most noble Antony

nay press not so upon me stand far off

stand back room bear back

if you have tears prepare to shed them now
you all do know this mantle I remember
the first time ever C sar put it on
'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent
that day he overcame the Nervii
look in this place ran Cassius' dagger through
see what a rent the envious Casca made
and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away
mark how the blood of C sar follow'd it
as rushing out of doors to be resolv'd
if Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no
for Brutus as you know was C sar's angel
judge O you gods how dearly C sar lov'd him
this was the most unkindest cut of all
for when the noble C sar saw him stab
ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms
quite vanquish'd him then burst his mighty heart
and in his mantle muffling up his face
even at the base of Pompey's status
which all the while ran blood great C sar fell
O what a fall was there my countrymen
then I and you and all of us fell down
whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us
O now you weep and I perceive you feel
the dint of pity these are gracious drops
kind souls what weep you when you but behold
here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors

O piteous spectacle

O noble C sar

O woeful day

O traitors villains

O most bloody sight

we will be revenged

revenge About Seek Burn
fire Kill Slay Let not a traitor live

stay countrymen


we'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with him

good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
to such a sudden flood of mutiny
they that have done this deed are honourable
what private griefs they have alas I know not
that made them do it they are wise and honourable
and will no doubt with reasons answer you
I come not friends to steal away your hearts
I am no orator as Brutus is
but as you know me all a plain blunt man
that love my friend and that they know full well
that gave me public leave to speak of him
for I have neither wit nor words nor worth
action nor utterance nor the power of speech
to stir men's blood I only speak right on
I tell you that which you yourselves do know
show you sweet C sar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths
and Brutus Antony there were an Antony
would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
in every wound of C sar that should move
the stones of Rome to rise and mutiny

we'll mutiny

we'll burn the house of Brutus

away then come seek the conspirators

yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak

peace ho Hear Antony most noble Antony

why friends you go to do you know not what
wherein hath C sar thus deserv'd your loves
alas you know not I must tell you then
you have forgot the will I told you of
most true The will let's stay and hear the will

here is the will and under C sar's seal
to every Roman citizen he gives
to every several man seventy-five drachmas

most noble C sar we'll revenge his death

O royal C sar

hear me with patience

peace ho

moreover he hath left you all his walks
his private arbours and new-planted orchards
on this side Tiber he hath left them you
and to your heirs for ever common pleasures
to walk abroad and recreate yourselves

never never Come away away
we'll burn his body in the holy place
and with the brands fire the traitors' houses
take up the body

go fetch fire

pluck down benches

pluck down forms windows any thing


now let it work mischief thou art afoot
take thou what course thou wilt

how now fellow

sir Octavius is already come to Rome
where is he

he and Lepidus are at C sar's house

and thither will I straight to visit him
he comes upon a wish Fortune is merry
and in this mood will give us any thing

I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome

belike they had some notice of the people
how I had mov'd them Bring me to Octavius


I dreamt to-night that I did feast with C sar
and things unlucky charge my fantasy
I have no will to wander forth of doors
yet something leads me forth

what is your name

whither are you going

where do you dwell

are you a married man or a bachelor

answer every man directly

ay and briefly

ay and wisely

ay and truly you were best

what is my name Whither am I going Where do I dwell Am I a married man or a bachelor Then to answer every man directly and briefly wisely and truly wisely I say I am a bachelor


directly I am going to C sar's funeral

as a friend or an enemy

as a friend

that matter is answered directly

for your dwelling briefly

briefly I dwell by the Capitol

your name sir truly

truly my name is Cinna

tear him to pieces he's a conspirator


tear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad verses

I am not Cinna the conspirator

it is no matter his name's Cinna pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going

tear him tear him Come brands ho firebrands To Brutus' to Cassius' burn all Some to Decius' house and some to Casca's some to Ligarius' Away go

these many then shall die their names are prick'd

your brother too must die consent you Lepidus

I do consent

prick him down Antony

upon condition Publius shall not live
who is your sister's son Mark Antony
he shall not live look with a spot I damn him
but Lepidus go you to C sar's house
fetch the will hither and we shall determine
how to cut off some charge in legacies

what shall I find you here

or here or at the Capitol


this is a slight unmeritable man
meet to be sent on errands is it fit
the three-fold world divided he should stand
one of the three to share it

so you thought him
and took his voice who should be prick'd to die
in our black sentence and proscription

and though we lay these honours on this man
to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
to groan and sweat under the business
either led or driven as we point the way
and having brought our treasure where we will
then take we down his load and turn him off
like to the empty ass to shake his ears
and graze in commons

you may do your will
but he's a tried and valiant soldier

so is my horse Octavius and for that
I do appoint him store of provender
it is a creature that I teach to fight
to wind to stop to run directly on
his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit
and in some taste is Lepidus but so
a barren-spirited fellow one that feeds
on abject orts and imitations
which out of use and stal'd by other men
begin his fashion do not talk of him
but as a property And now Octavius
listen great things Brutus and Cassius
are levying powers we must straight make head
therefore let our alliance be combin'd
our best friends made and our best means stretch'd out
and let us presently go sit in council
how covert matters may be best disclos'd
and open perils surest answered

let us do so for we are at the stake
and bay'd about with many enemies
and some that smile have in their hearts I fear
millions of mischiefs



give the word ho and stand

what now Lucilius is Cassius near

he is at hand and Pindarus is come
to do you salutation from his master


he greets me well Your master Pindarus
in his own change or by ill officers
hath given me some worthy cause to wish
things done undone but if he be at hand
I shall be satisfied

I do not doubt
but that my noble master will appear
such as he is full of regard and honour

how he receiv'd you let me be resolv'd

with courtesy and with respect enough
but not with such familiar instances
nor with such free and friendly conference
as he hath us'd of old

thou hast describ'd
a hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius
when love begins to sicken and decay
it useth an enforced ceremony
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith
but hollow men like horses hot at hand
make gallant show and promise of their mettle
but when they should endure the bloody spur
they fall their crests and like deceitful jades
sink in the trial Comes his army on

they mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd
are come with Cassius

hark he is arriv'd

march gently on to meet him


stand ho

stand ho Speak the word along

stand

stand

stand

most noble brother you have done me wrong

and if not so how should I wrong a brother

Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
and when you do them

Cassius be content
speak your griefs softly I do know you well
before the eyes of both our armies here
which should perceive nothing but love from us
let us not wrangle bid them move away
then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
and I will give you audience

Pindarus
bid our commanders lead their charges off
a little from this ground

Lucilius do you the like and let no man
come to our tent till we have done our conference


that you have wrong'd me doth appear in this
you have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
for taking bribes here of the Sardians
wherein my letters praying on his side
because I knew the man were slighted off

you wrong'd yourself to write in such a case

in such a time as this it is not meet
that every nice offence should bear his comment

let me tell you Cassius you yourself
are much condemn'd to have an itching palm
to sell and mart your offices for gold
to undeservera

I an itching palm
or by the gods this speech were else your last

the name of Cassius honours this corruption
and chastisement doth therefore hide his head

chastisement

remember March the ides of March remember
did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake
what villain touch'd his body that did stab
and not for justice What shall one of us
that struck the foremost man of all this world
but for supporting robbers shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes
and sell the mighty space of our large honours
for so much trash as may be grasped thus
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
than such a Roman

I'll not endure it you forget yourself
to hedge me in I am a soldier I
older in practice abler than yourself
to make conditions

go to you are not Cassius

I am

I say you are not

urge me no more I shall forget myself
have mind upon your health tempt me no further

away slight man

is t possible

hear me for I will speak
shall I be frighted when a madman stares

O ye gods ye gods Must I endure all this

all this ay more fret till your proud heart break
go show your slaves how choleric you are
and make your bondmen tremble Must I budge
must I observe you Must I stand and crouch
under your testy humour By the gods
you shall digest the venom of your spleen
though it do split you for from this day forth
I'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
when you are waspish

is it come to this

you say you are a better soldier
let it appear so make your vaunting true
and it shall please me well For mine own part

you wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
I said an elder soldier not a better
did I say better

if you did I care not

when C sar liv'd he durst not thus have mov'd me

peace peace you durst not so have tempted him

I durst not

no

what durst not tempt him

for your life you durst not

I may do that I shall be sorry for

you have done that you should be sorry for
there is no terror Cassius in your threats
for I am arm'd so strong in honesty
that they pass by me as the idle wind
which I respect not I did send to you
for certain sums of gold which you denied me
for I can raise no money by vile means
by heaven I had rather coin my heart
and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
by any indirection I did send
to you for gold to pay my legions
which you denied me was that done like Cassius
should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so
when Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
to lock such rascal counters from his friends
be ready gods with all your thunderbolts

I denied you not

you did

I did not he was but a fool
that brought my answer back Brutus hath riv'd my heart
a friend should bear his friend's infirmities
but Brutus makes mine greater than they are

I do not till you practise them on me

you love me not

I do not like your faults

a friendly eye could never see such faults

a flatterer's would not though they do appear

come Antony and young Octavius come
revenge yourselves alone on Cassius
for Cassius is aweary of the world
hated by one he loves brav'd by his brother
check'd like a bondman all his faults observ'd
set in a note-book learn'd and conn'd by rote
to cast into my teeth O I could weep
my spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger
and here my naked breast within a heart
dearer than Plutus' mine richer than gold
if that thou be'st a Roman take it forth
I that denied thee gold will give my heart
strike as thou didst at C sar for I know
when thou didst hate him worst thou lov'dst him better
than ever thou lov'dst Cassius

sheathe your dagger
be angry when you will it shall have scope
O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb
that carries anger as the flint bears fire
who much enforced shows a hasty spark
and straight is cold again

hath Cassius liv'd
to be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
when grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him

when I spoke that I was ill-temper'd too

do you confess so much Give me your hand

and my heart too

O Brutus

what's the matter

when that rash humour which my mother gave me
makes me forgetful

yes Cassius and from henceforth
when you are over-earnest with your Brutus
he'll think your mother chides and leave you so


let me go in to see the generals
there is some grudge between em tis not meet
they be alone

you shall not come to them

nothing but death shall stay me


how now What's the matter

love and be friends as two such men should be
for I have seen more years I'm sure than ye

ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rime

get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence

bear with him Brutus tis his fashion

I'll know his humour when he knows his time
what should the wars do with these jigging fools
companion hence

away away be gone


Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders
prepare to lodge their companies to-night

immediately to us


Lucius a bowl of wine


I did not think you could have been so angry

O Cassius I am sick of many griefs

of your philosophy you make no use
if you give place to accidental evils

no man bears sorrow better Portia is dead

ha Portia

she is dead

O insupportable and touching loss
upon what sickness

impatient of my absence
and grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
have made themselves so strong for with her death
that tidings came with this she fell distract
and her attendants absent swallow'd fire

and died so

even so

O ye immortal gods


speak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine
in this I bury all unkindness Cassius

my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
fill Lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love


come in Titinius

welcome good Messala
now sit we close about this taper here

and call in question our necessities

Portia art thou gone

no more I pray you
Messala I have here received letters
that young Octavius and Mark Antony
come down upon us with a mighty power
bending their expedition towards Philippi
myself have letters of the self-same tenour

with what addition

that by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius Antony and Lepidus
have put to death an hundred senators

therein our letters do not well agree
mine speak of seventy senators that died
by their proscriptions Cicero being one

Cicero one

Cicero is dead
and by that order of proscription
had you your letters from your wife my lord

no Messala
nor nothing in your letters writ of her

nothing Messala

that methinks is strange

why ask you Hear you aught of her in yours

no my lord

now as you are a Roman tell me true

then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
for certain she is dead and by strange manner

why farewell Portia We must die Messala
with meditating that she must die once
I have the patience to endure it now


I have as much of this in art as you
but yet my nature could not bear it so

well to our work alive What do you think
of marching to Philippi presently

I do not think it good

your reason

this is it
'Tis better that the enemy seek us
so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
doing himself offence whilst we lying still
are full of rest defence and nimbleness

good reasons must of force give place to better
the people twixt Philippi and this ground
for they have grudg'd us contribution
the enemy marching along by them
by them shall make a fuller number up
come on refresh'd new-added and encourag'd
from which advantage shall we cut him off
if at Philippi we do face him there
these people at our back

hear me good brother

under your pardon You must note beside
that we have tried the utmost of our friends
our legions are brim-full our cause is ripe
the enemy increaseth every day
we at the height are ready to decline
there is a tide in the affairs of men
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
omitted all the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries
and we must take the current when it serves
or lose our ventures

then with your will go on
we'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi

the deep of night is crept upon our talk
and nature must obey necessity
which we will niggard with a little rest
there is no more to say

no more Good-night
early to-morrow will we rise and hence

Lucius


my gown

good-night Titinius Noble noble Cassius

good-night and good repose

O my dear brother
this was an ill beginning of the night
never come such division tween our souls
let it not Brutus

every thing is well

good-night my lord

good-night good brother

good-night Lord Brutus

good-night Lord Brutus



give me the gown Where is thy instrument

here in the tent

what thou speak'st drowsily
poor knave I blame thee not thou art o'erwatch'd
call Claudius and some other of my men
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent

Varro and Claudius


calls my lord

I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep
it may be I shall raise you by and by
on business to my brother Cassius
so please you we will stand and watch your pleasure

I will not have it so lie down good sirs
it may be I shall otherwise bethink me
look Lucius here's the book I sought for so
I put it in the pocket of my gown


I was sure your lordship did not give it me

bear with me good boy I am much forgetful
canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile
and touch thy instrument a strain or two

ay my lord an t please you

it does my boy
I trouble thee too much but thou art willing


I should not urge thy duty past thy might
I know young bloods look for a time of rest

I have slept my lord already

it was well done and thou shalt sleep again
I will not hold thee long if I do live
I will be good to thee

this is a sleepy tune O murderous slumber
lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
that plays thee music Gentle knave good-night
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee
if thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument
I'll take it from thee and good boy good-night
let me see let me see is not the leaf turn'd down
where I left reading Here it is I think

how ill this taper burns Ha who comes here
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
that shapes this monstrous apparition
it comes upon me Art thou any thing
art thou some god some angel or some devil
that mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare

speak to me what thou art

thy evil spirit Brutus

why com'st thou

to tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi

well then I shall see thee again

ay at Philippi


now I have taken heart thou vanishest
ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee
boy Lucius Varro Claudius Sirs awake
Claudius

the strings my lord are false

he thinks he still is at his instrument
Lucius awake

my lord

didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out

my lord I do not know that I did cry

yes that thou didst Didst thou see any thing


sleep again Lucius Sirrah Claudius
fellow thou awake

my lord

my lord

why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep

did we my lord

did we my lord

ay saw you any thing

no my lord I saw nothing

nor I my lord
go and commend me to my brother Cassius
bid him set on his powers betimes before
and we will follow

it shall be done my lord

it shall be done my lord

now Antony our hopes are answered
you said the enemy would not come down
but keep the hills and upper regions
it proves not so their battles are at hand
they mean to warn us at Philippi here
answering before we do demand of them

tut I am in their bosoms and I know
wherefore they do it they could be content
to visit other places and come down
with fearful bravery thinking by this face
but tis not so


prepare you generals
the enemy comes on in gallant show
their bloody sign of battle is hung out
and something to be done immediately

Octavius lead your battle softly on
upon the left hand of the even field

upon the right hand I keep thou the left

why do you cross me in this exigent

I do not cross you but I will do so

they stand and would have parley


mark Antony shall we give sign of battle

no C sar we will answer on their charge
make forth the generals would have some words

stir not until the signal

words before blows is it so countrymen

not that we love words better as you do

good words are better than bad strokes Octavius

in your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
witness the hole you made in C sar's heart
crying Long live hail C sar

Antony
but for your words they rob the Hybla bees
and leave them honeyless

not stingless too

O yes and soundless too
for you have stol'n their buzzing Antony
and very wisely threat before you sting

villains you did not so when your vile daggers
hack'd one another in the sides of C sar
how show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds
and bow'd like bondmen kissing C sar's feet
whilst damned Casca like a cur behind
struck C sar on the neck O you flatterers

flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
this tongue had not offended so to-day
if Cassius might have rul'd
come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
the proof of it will turn to redder drops
look
I draw a sword against conspirators
when think you that the sword goes up again
never till C sar's three-and-thirty wounds
be well aveng'd or till another C sar
have added slaughter to the sword of traitors

C sar thou canst not die by traitors' hands
unless thou bring'st them with thee

so I hope
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword

O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
young man thou couldst not die more honourable

a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour

old Cassius still

come Antony away
defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
if you dare fight to-day come to the field
if not when you have stomachs


why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
the storm is up and all is on the hazard

ho
Lucilius hark a word with you

my lord


Messala
what says my general

Messala
this is my birth-day as this very day
was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
be thou my witness that against my will
as Pompey was am I compell'd to set
upon one battle all our liberties
you know that I held Epicurus strong
and his opinion now I change my mind
and partly credit things that do presage
coming from Sardis on our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd
gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands
who to Philippi here consorted us
this morning are they fled away and gone
and in their stead do ravens crows and kites
fly o'er our heads and downward look on us
as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
our army lies ready to give up the ghost

believe not so

I but believe it partly
for I am fresh of spirit and resolv'd
to meet all perils very constantly

even so Lucilius

now most noble Brutus
the gods to-day stand friendly that we may
lovers in peace lead on our days to age
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain
let's reason with the worst that may befall
if we do lose this battle then is this
the very last time we shall speak together
what are you then determined to do

by which I did blame Cato for the death
which he did give himself I know not how
but I do find it cowardly and vile
for fear of what might fall so to prevent
the time of life arming myself with patience
to stay the providence of some high powers
that govern us below

then if we lose this battle
you are contented to be led in triumph
thorough the streets of Rome

no Cassius no think not thou noble Roman
that ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
he bears too great a mind but this same day
must end that work the ides of March begun
and whether we shall meet again I know not
therefore our everlasting farewell take
for ever and for ever farewell Cassius
if not why then this parting was well made

for ever and for ever farewell Brutus
if we do meet again we'll smile indeed
if not tis true this parting was well made

why then lead on O that a man might know
the end of this day's business ere it come
but it sufficeth that the day will end
and then the end is known Come ho away


ride ride Messala ride and give these bills
unto the legions on the other side

let them set on at once for I perceive
but cold demeanour in Octavius' wing
and sudden push gives them the overthrow
ride ride Messala let them all come down

O look Titinius look the villains fly
myself have to mine own turn'd enemy
this ensign here of mine was turning back
I slew the coward and did take it from him

O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
who having some advantage on Octavius
took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
whilst we by Antony are all enclos'd


fly further off my lord fly further off
mark Antony is in your tents my lord
fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off

this hill is far enough Look look Titinius
are those my tents where I perceive the fire


Titinius if thou lov'st me
mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
and here again that I may rest assur'd
whether yond troops are friend or enemy

I will be here again even with a thought


go Pindarus get higher on that hill
my sight was ever thick regard Titinius
and tell me what thou not'st about the field

this day I breathed first time is come round
and where I did begin there shall I end
my life is run his compass Sirrah what news

O my lord
what news

Titinius is enclosed round about
with horsemen that make to him on the spur
yet he spurs on now they are almost on him
now Titinius now some light O he lights too
he's ta'en

and hark they shout for joy

come down behold no more
O coward that I am to live so long
to see my best friend ta'en before my face

come hither sirrah
in Parthia did I take thee prisoner
and then I swore thee saving of thy life
that whatsoever I did bid thee do
thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath
that ran through C sar's bowels search this bosom
stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
and when my face is cover'd as tis now
guide thou the sword C sar thou art reveng'd
even with the sword that kill'd thee


so I am free yet would not so have been
durst I have done my will O Cassius
far from this country Pindarus shall run
where never Roman shall take note of him

it is but change Titinius for Octavius
is overthrown by noble Brutus' power
as Cassius' legions are by Antony

these tidings will well comfort Cassius

where did you leave him
all disconsolate
with Pindarus his bondman on this hill

is not that he that lies upon the ground

he lies not like the living O my heart

is not that he

no this was he Messala
but Cassius is no more O setting sun
as in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night
so in his red blood Cassius' day is set
the sun of Rome is set Our day is gone
clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
mistrust of my success hath done this deed

mistrust of good success hath done this deed
O hateful error melancholy's child
the things that are not O error soon conceiv'd
thou never com'st unto a happy birth
but kill'st the mother that engender'd thee

what Pindarus Where art thou Pindarus

seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet
the noble Brutus thrusting this report
into his ears I may say thrusting it
for piercing steel and darts envenomed
shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
as tidings of this sight

hie you Messala
and I will seek for Pindarus the while

why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
did I not meet thy friends and did not they
put on my brows this wreath of victory
alas thou hast misconstru'd every thing
but hold thee take this garland on thy brow
thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I
will do his bidding Brutus come apace
and see how I regarded Caius Cassius
by your leave gods this is a Roman's part
come Cassius' sword and find Titinius' heart

where where Messala doth his body lie

lo yonder and Titinius mourning it

Titinius' face is upward

he is slain

O Julius C sar thou art mighty yet
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
in our own proper entrails

brave Titinius
look whe'r he have not crown'd dead Cassius

are yet two Romans living such as these
the last of all the Romans fare thee well
it is impossible that ever Rome
should breed thy fellow Friends I owe more tears
to this dead man than you shall see me pay
I shall find time Cassius I shall find time
come therefore and to Thassos send his body
his funerals shall not be in our camp
lest it discomfort us Lucilius come
and come young Cato let us to the field
labeo and Flavius set our battles on
'Tis three o'clock and Romans yet ere night
we shall try fortune in a second fight



what bastard doth not Who will go with me
I will proclaim my name about the field
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
a foe to tyrants and my country's friend
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho

and I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I
Brutus my country's friend know me for Brutus


O young and noble Cato art thou down
why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius
and mayst be honour'd being Cato's son

yield or thou diest

only I yield to die
there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight
kill Brutus and be honour'd in his death

we must not A noble prisoner

room ho Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en

I'll tell the news here comes the general

Brutus is ta'en my lord

where is he

safe Antony Brutus is safe enough
I dare assure thee that no enemy
shall ever take alive the noble Brutus
the gods defend him from so great a shame
when you do find him or alive or dead
he will be found like Brutus like himself

a prize no less in worth Keep this man safe
give him all kindness I had rather have
such men my friends than enemies Go on
and see whe'r Brutus be alive or dead
and bring us word unto Octavius' tent
how every thing is chanc'd


come poor remains of friends rest on this rock

statilius show'd the torch-light but my lord
he came not back he is or ta'en or slain

sit thee down Clitus slaying is the word
it is a deed in fashion Hark thee Clitus


what I my lord No not for all the world


I'll rather kill myself

hark thee Dardanius


shall I do such a deed

O Dardanius

O Clitus

what ill request did Brutus make to thee

to kill him Clitus Look he meditates

now is that noble vessel full of grief
that it runs over even at his eyes


what says my lord

why this Volumnius
the ghost of C sar hath appear'd to me
two several times by night at Sardis once
and this last night here in Philippi fields
I know my hour is come

not so my lord

nay I am sure it is Volumnius
thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes
our enemies have beat us to the pit
it is more worthy to leap in ourselves
than tarry till they push us Good Volumnius
thou know'st that we two went to school together
even for that our love of old I prithee
hold thou my sword-hilts whilst I run on it
that's not an office for a friend my lord


fly fly my lord there is no tarrying here

farewell to you and you and you Volumnius
Strato thou hast been all this while asleep
farewell to thee too Strato Countrymen
my heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me
I shall have glory by this losing day
more than Octavius and Mark Antony
by this vile conquest shall attain unto
so fare you well at once for Brutus' tongue
hath almost ended his life's history
night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest
that have but labour'd to attain this hour



hence I will follow

I prithee Strato stay thou by thy lord
thou art a fellow of a good respect
thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it
hold then my sword and turn away thy face
while I do run upon it Wilt thou Strato

give me your hand first fare you well my lord

farewell good Strato

C sar now be still
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will

what man is that

my master's man Strato where is thy master
free from the bondage you are in Messala
the conquerors can but make a fire of him
for Brutus only overcame himself
and no man else hath honour by his death

so Brutus should be found I thank thee Brutus
that thou hast prov'd Lucilius' saying true

all that serv'd Brutus I will entertain them
fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me

ay if Messala will prefer me to you

do so good Messala

how died my master Strato

I held the sword and he did run on it

that did the latest service to my master

this was the noblest Roman of them all
all the conspirators save only he
did that they did in envy of great C sar
he only in a general honest thought
and common good to all made one of them
his life was gentle and the elements
so mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
and say to all the world This was a man

according to his virtue let us use him
with all respect and rites of burial
within my tent his bones to-night shall lie
most like a soldier order'd honourably
so call the field to rest and let's away
to part the glories of this happy day

KING LEAR
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall

it did always seem so to us but now in the division of the kingdom it appears not which of the dukes he values most for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety

is not this your son my lord

his breeding sir hath been at my charge I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it

I cannot conceive you

sir this young fellow's mother could whereupon she grew round-wombed and had indeed sir a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed Do you smell a fault

I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so proper

but I have a son sir by order of law some year elder than this who yet is no dearer in my account though this knave came somewhat saucily into the world before he was sent for yet was his mother fair there was good sport at his making and the whoreson must be acknowledged Do you know this noble gentleman Edmund

no my lord

my Lord of Kent remember him hereafter as my honourable friend
my services to your lordship

I must love you and sue to know you better

sir I shall study deserving

he hath been out nine years and away he shall again The king is coming


attend the Lords of France and Burgundy Gloucester

I shall my liege


meantime we shall express our darker purpose
give me the map there Know that we have divided
in three our kingdom and tis our fast intent
to shake all cares and business from our age
conferring them on younger strengths while we
and you our no less loving son of Albany
we have this hour a constant will to publish
our daughters' several dowers that future strife
may be prevented now The princes France and Burgundy
great rivals in our youngest daughter's love
long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
and here are to be answer'd Tell me my daughters
since now we will divest us both of rule
interest of territory cares of state
which of you shall we say doth love us most
that we our largest bounty may extend
where nature doth with merit challenge Goneril
our eldest-born speak first

sir I love you more than words can wield the matter
dearer than eye-sight space and liberty
beyond what can be valu'd rich or rare
no less than life with grace health beauty honour
as much as child e'er lov'd or father found
beyond all manner of so much I love you

what shall Cordelia do Love and be silent

of all these bounds even from this line to this
with shadowy forests and with champains rich'd
with plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads
we make thee lady to thine and Albany's issue
be this perpetual What says our second daughter
our dearest Regan wife to Cornwall Speak

I am made of that self metal as my sister
and prize me at her worth In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love
only she comes too short that I profess
myself an enemy to all other joys
which the most precious square of sense possesses
and find I am alone felicitate
in your dear highness' love
then poor Cordelia
and yet not so since I am sure my love's
more richer than my tongue

to thee and thine hereditary ever
remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
no less in space validity and pleasure
than that conferr'd on Goneril Now our joy
although our last not least to whose young love
the vines of France and milk of Burgundy
strive to be interess'd what can you say to draw
a third more opulent than your sisters Speak

nothing my lord

nothing

nothing


unhappy that I am I cannot heave
my heart into my mouth I love your majesty
according to my bond nor more nor less

how how Cordelia mend your speech a little
lest you may mar your fortunes

good my lord
you have begot me bred me lov'd me I
return those duties back as are right fit
obey you love you and most honour you
why have my sisters husbands if they say
they love you all Haply when I shall wed
that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
half my love with him half my care and duty
sure I shall never marry like my sisters
to love my father all


ay good my lord

so young and so untender

so young my lord and true

let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
for by the sacred radiance of the sun
the mysteries of Hecate and the night
by all the operation of the orbs
from whom we do exist and cease to be
here I disclaim all my paternal care
propinquity and property of blood
and as a stranger to my heart and me
hold thee from this for ever The barbarous Scythian
or he that makes his generation messes
to gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
be as well neighbour'd pitied and reliev'd

good my liege

peace Kent
come not between the dragon and his wrath
I lov'd her most and thought to set my rest
on her kind nursery Hence and avoid my sight
so be my grave my peace as here I give
her father's heart from her Call France Who stirs
call Burgundy Cornwall and Albany
with my two daughters' dowers digest the third
let pride which she calls plainness marry her
I do invest you jointly with my power
pre-eminence and all the large effects
that troop with majesty Ourself by monthly course
with reservation of a hundred knights
by you to be sustain'd shall our abode
make with you by due turn Only we shall retain
the name and all th' addition to a king
beloved sons be yours which to confirm
this coronet part between you

royal Lear
whom I have ever honour'd as my king
lov'd as my father as my master follow'd
as my great patron thought on in my prayers

the bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft

let it fall rather though the fork invade
the region of my heart be Kent unmannerly
when Lear is mad What wouldst thou do old man
think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
when power to flattery bows To plainness honour's bound
when majesty falls to folly Reserve thy state
and in thy best consideration check
this hideous rashness answer my life my judgment
thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
reverbs no hollowness

Kent on thy life no more

my life I never held but as a pawn
to wage against thine enemies nor fear to lose it
thy safety being the motive

out of my sight

see better Lear and let me still remain
the true blank of thine eye

now by Apollo

now by Apollo king
thou swear'st thy gods in vain

O vassal miscreant

dear sir forbear

dear sir forbear

do
kill thy physician and the fee bestow
upon the foul disease Revoke thy gift
or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat
I'll tell thee thou dost evil

hear me recreant
on thine allegiance hear me
since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
which we durst never yet and with strain'd pride
to come betwixt our sentence and our power
which nor our nature nor our place can hear
our potency made good take thy reward
five days we do allot thee for provision
and on the sixth to turn thy hated back
upon our kingdom if on the tenth day following
thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions
the moment is thy death Away By Jupiter
this shall not be revok'd

fare thee well king sith thus thou wilt appear
freedom lives hence and banishment is here


the gods to their dear shelter take thee maid
that justly think'st and hast most rightly said


and your large speeches may your deeds approve
that good effects may spring from words of love
thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu
he'll shape his old course in a country new


my Lord of Burgundy
we first address toward you who with this king
hath rivall'd for our daughter What in the least
will you require in present dower with her
or cease your quest of love

most royal majesty
I crave no more than hath your highness offer'd
nor will you tender less

right noble Burgundy
when she was dear to us we did hold her so
but now her price is fall'n Sir there she stands
if aught within that little-seeming substance
or all of it with our displeasure piec'd
and nothing more may fitly like your Grace
she's there and she is yours


will you with those infirmities she owes
unfriended new-adopted to our hate
dower'd with our curse and stranger'd with our oath
take her or leave her

pardon me royal sir
election makes not up on such conditions

then leave her sir for by the power that made me
I tell you all her wealth

for you great king
I would not from your love make such a stray
to match you where I hate therefore beseech you
to avert your liking a more worthier way
than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
almost to acknowledge hers

that she who even but now was your best object
the argument of your praise balm of your age
the best the dearest should in this trice of time
commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
so many folds of favour Sure her offence
must be of such unnatural degree
that monsters it or your fore-vouch'd affection
fall into taint which to believe of her
must be a faith that reason without miracle
could never plant in me

I yet beseech your majesty
if for I want that glib and oily art
to speak and purpose not since what I well intend
I'll do t before I speak that you make known
it is no vicious blot nor other foulness
no unchaste action or dishonour'd step
that hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour
but even for want of that for which I am richer
that I am glad I have not though not to have it
hath lost me in your liking

better thou
hadst not been born than not to have pleas'd me better

is it but this a tardiness in nature
which often leaves the history unspoke
that it intends to do My Lord of Burgundy
what say you to the lady Love is not love
when it is mingled with regards that stand
aloof from the entire point Will you have her
she is herself a dowry

royal Lear
give but that portion which yourself propos'd
and here I take Cordelia by the hand
duchess of Burgundy


I am sorry then you have so lost a father
that you must lose a husband

peace be with Burgundy
since that respects of fortune are his love
I shall not be his wife

fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor
most choice forsaken and most lov'd despis'd
thee and thy virtues here I seize upon
be it lawful I take up what's cast away
gods gods tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
my love should kindle to inflam'd respect
thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance
is queen of us of ours and our fair France
not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
shall buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me
bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind

thou hast her France let her be thine for we
have no such daughter nor shall ever see
that face of hers again therefore be gone
without our grace our love our benison
come noble Burgundy


bid farewell to your sisters

the jewels of our father with wash'd eyes
Cordelia leaves you I know you what you are
and like a sister am most loath to call
your faults as they are nam'd Use well our father
to your professed bosoms I commit him
but yet alas stood I within his grace
I would prefer him to a better place
so farewell to you both


let your study
be to content your lord who hath receiv'd you
at fortune's alms you have obedience scanted
and well are worth the want that you have wanted

time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides
who covers faults at last shame them derides
well may you prosper

come my fair Cordelia


sister it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both I think our father will hence to-night

that's most certain and with you next month with us

you see how full of changes his age is the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly


the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them

such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment

there is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him Pray you let us hit together if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender of his will but offend us

we shall further think on't

we must do something and i' the heat


thou Nature art my goddess to thy law
my services are bound Wherefore should I
stand in the plague of custom and permit
the curiosity of nations to deprive me
for that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
lag of a brother Why bastard wherefore base
when my dimensions are as well compact
as honest madam's issue Why brand they us
with base with baseness bastardy base base
who in the lusty stealth of nature take
more composition and fierce quality
than doth within a dull stale tired bed
go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
got tween asleep and wake Well then
legitimate Edgar I must have your land
our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
as to the legitimate Fine word legitimate
well my legitimate if this letter speed
and my invention thrive Edmund the base
shall top the legitimate I grow I prosper
now gods stand up for bastards


Kent banished thus And France in choler parted
and the king gone to-night subscrib'd his power
confin'd to exhibition All this done

so please your lordship none


why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter

I know no news my lord

what paper were you reading

nothing my lord

no What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself Let's see come if it be nothing I shall not need spectacles

I beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read and for so much as I have perused I find it not fit for your o'er-looking

give me the letter sir

I shall offend either to detain or give it The contents as in part I understand them are to blame
let's see let's see

I hope for my brother's justification he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue

this policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not as it hath power but as it is suffered Come to me that of this I may speak more If our father would sleep till I waked him you should enjoy half his revenue for ever and live the beloved of your brother

it was not brought me my lord there's the cunning of it I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet

you know the character to be your brother's

if the matter were good my lord I durst swear it were his but in respect of that I would fain think it were not

it is his

it is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is not in the contents

hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business

never my lord but I have often heard him maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age and fathers declined the father should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
O villain villain His very opinion in the letter Abhorred villain Unnatural detested brutish villain worse than brutish Go sirrah seek him I'll apprehend him Abominable villain Where is he

I do not well know my lord If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent you shall run a certain course where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour and to no other pretence of danger

think you so

if your honour judge it meet I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening

he cannot be such a monster

nor is not sure

to his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him Heaven and earth Edmund seek him out wind me into him I pray you frame the business after your own wisdom I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution

I will seek him sir presently convey the business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal

these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects Love cools friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked between son and father This villain of mine comes under the prediction there's son against father the king falls from bias of nature there's father against child We have seen the best of our time machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves Find out this villain Edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it carefully And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished his offence honesty Tis strange



and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy my cue is villanous melancholy with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam O these eclipses do portend these divisions Fa sol la mi

how now brother Edmund What serious contemplation are you in

I am thinking brother of a prediction I read this other day what should follow these eclipses

do you busy yourself with that

I promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent death dearth dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state menaces and maledictions against king and nobles needless diffidences banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts nuptial breaches and I know not what

how long have you been a sectary astronomical

come come when saw you my father last

the night gone by

spake you with him


parted you in good terms Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance

none at all

bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay

some villain hath done me wrong

that's my fear I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower and as I say retire with me to my lodging from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak Pray you go there's my key If you do stir abroad go armed

armed brother

brother I advise you to the best go armed I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you I have told you what I have seen and heard but faintly nothing like the image and horror of it pray you away

shall I hear from you anon

I do serve you in this business

whose nature is so far from doing harms
that he suspects none on whose foolish honesty
my practices ride easy I see the business
let me if not by birth have lands by wit
all with me's meet that I can fashion fit


did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool

ay madam

by day and night he wrongs me every hour
he flashes into one gross crime or other
that sets us all at odds I'll not endure it
his knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us
on every trifle When he returns from hunting
I will not speak with him say I am sick
if you come slack of former services
you shall do well the fault of it I'll answer
he's coming madam I hear him


put on what weary negligence you please
you and your fellows I'd have it come to question
if he distaste it let him to my sister
whose mind and mine I know in that are one
not to be over-rul'd Idle old man
that still would manage those authorities
that he hath given away Now by my life
old fools are babes again and must be us'd
with cheeks as flatteries when they are seen abus'd
remember what I have said

well madam

and let his knights have colder looks among you
what grown of it no matter advise your fellows so
I would breed from hence occasions and I shall
to hold my very source Prepare for dinner


if but as well I other accents borrow
that can my speech diffuse my good intent
may carry through itself to that full issue
for which I raz'd my likeness Now banish'd Kent
if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd
so may it come thy master whom thou lov'st
shall find thee full of labours


let me not stay a jot for dinner go get it ready

how now what art thou

a man sir

what dost thou profess What wouldst thou with us
I do profess to be no less than I seem to serve him truly that will put me in trust to love him that is honest to converse with him that is wise and says little to fear judgment to fight when I cannot choose and to eat no fish

what art thou

a very honest-hearted fellow and as poor as the king

if thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a king thou art poor enough What wouldst thou

service

whom wouldst thou serve

you

dost thou know me fellow

no sir but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master

what's that
authority

what services canst thou do

I can keep honest counsel ride run mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly that which ordinary men are fit for I am qualified in and the best of me is diligence

how old art thou

not so young sir to love a woman for singing nor so old to dote on her for any thing I have years on my back forty-eight

follow me thou shalt serve me if I like thee no worse after dinner I will not part from thee yet Dinner ho dinner Where's my knave my fool Go you and call my fool hither

what says the fellow there Call the clotpoll back
where's my fool ho I think the world's asleep How now where's that mongrel


he says my lord your daughter is not well

why came not the slave back to me when I called him

sir he answered me in the roundest manner he would not

he would not

my lord I know not what the matter is but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont there's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and your daughter

ha sayest thou so

I beseech you pardon me my lord if I be mistaken for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged

thou but rememberest me of mine own conception I have perceived a most faint neglect of late which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness I will look further into t But where's my fool I have not seen him this two days


no more of that I have noted it well
go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her

go you call hither my fool

O you sir you come you hither sir Who am

I sir

my lady's father

'My lady's father my lord's knave you whoreson dog you slave you cur

I am none of these my lord I beseech your pardon

do you bandy looks with me you rascal



nor tripped neither you base football player


I thank thee fellow thou servest me and I'll love thee

come sir arise away I'll teach you differences away away If you will measure your lubber's length again tarry but away
go to have you wisdom so


now my friendly knave I thank thee there's earnest of thy service

let me hire him too here's my coxcomb


how now my pretty knave how dost thou

sirrah you were best take my coxcomb


why for taking one's part that's out of favour Nay an thou canst not smile as the wind sits thou'lt catch cold shortly there take my coxcomb Why this fellow has banished two on s daughters and did the third a blessing against his will if thou follow him thou must needs wear my coxcomb How now nuncle Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters

why my boy

if I gave them all my living I'd keep my coxcombs myself There's mine beg another of thy daughters

take heed sirrah the whip

truth's a dog must to kennel he must be whipped out when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink

a pestilent gall to me

sirrah I'll teach' thee a speech

do

mark it nuncle

speak less than thou knowest
lend less than thou owest
ride more than thou goest
learn more than thou trowest
set less than thou throwest
leave thy drink and thy whore
and keep in-a-door
and thou shalt have more
than two tens to a score


this is nothing fool

then tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer you gave me nothing for t Can you make no use of nothing nuncle

why no boy nothing can be made out of nothing

prithee tell him so much the rent of his land comes to he will not believe a fool


dost thou know the difference my boy between a bitter fool and a sweet fool

no lad teach me


that lord that counsell'd thee
to give away thy land
come place him here by me
do thou for him stand
the sweet and bitter fool
will presently appear
the one in motley here
the other found out there


dost thou call me fool boy

all thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with
this is not altogether fool my lord

no faith lords and great men will not let me if I had a monopoly out they would have part on t and ladies too they will not let me have all fool to myself they'll be snatching Nuncle give me an egg and I'll give thee two crowns

what two crowns shall they be

why after I have cut the egg i' the middle and eat up the meat the two crowns of the egg When thou clovest thy crown i' the middle and gavest away both parts thou borest thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away If I speak like myself in this let him be whipped that first finds it so

fools had ne'er less grace in a year
for wise men are grown foppish
and know not how their wits to wear
their manners are so apish


when were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah

I have used it nuncle ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers for when thou gavest them the rod and puttest down thine own breeches

then they for sudden joy did weep
that such a king should play bo-peep
and go the fools among

prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie I would fain learn to lie

an you lie sirrah we'll have you whipped

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are they'll have me whipped for speaking true thou'lt have me whipped for lying and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool and yet I would not be thee nuncle thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing i' the middle here comes one o' the parings


how now daughter what makes that frontlet on Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown

thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning now thou art an O without a figure I am better than thou art now I am a fool thou art nothing

yes forsooth I will hold my tongue so your face bids me though you say nothing

mum mum
he that keeps nor crust nor crumb
weary of all shall want some
that's a shealed peascod


not only sir this your all-licens'd fool
but other of your insolent retinue
do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth
in rank and not-to-be-endured riots Sir
I had thought by making this well known unto you
to have found a safe redress but now grow fearful
by what yourself too late have spoke and done
that you protect this course and put it on
by your allowance which if you should the fault
would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep
which in the tender of a wholesome weal
might in their working do you that offence
which else were shame that then necessity
will call discreet proceeding

for you trow nuncle
the hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
that it had it head bit off by it young

so out went the candle and we were left darkling

are you our daughter

I would you would make use of your good wisdom
whereof I know you are fraught and put away
these dispositions which of late transform you
from what you rightly are

may not an ass know when the cart draws the horse Whoop Jug I love thee

does any here know me This is not Lear
does Lear walk thus speak thus Where are his eyes
either his notion weakens his discernings
are lethargied Ha waking tis not so
who is it that can tell me who I am
Lear's shadow

I would learn that for by the marks of sovereignty knowledge and reason I should be false persuaded I had daughters

which they will make an obedient father

your name fair gentlewoman

this admiration sir is much o' the favour
of other your new pranks I do beseech you
to understand my purposes aright
as you are old and reverend should be wise
here do you keep a hundred knights and squires
men so disorder'd so debosh'd and bold
that this our court infected with their manners
shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust
make it more like a tavern or a brothel
than a grac'd palace The shame itself doth speak
for instant remedy be then desir'd
a little to disquantity your train
and the remainder that shall still depend
to be such men as may besort your age
which know themselves and you

darkness and devils
saddle my horses call my train together
degenerate bastard I'll not trouble thee
yet have I left a daughter

you strike my people and your disorder'd rabble
make servants of their betters


woe that too late repents


O sir are you come
is it your will Speak sir Prepare my horses
more hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
than the sea-monster

pray sir be patient

detested kite thou liest
my train are men of choice and rarest parts
that all particulars of duty know
and in the most exact regard support
the worships of their name O most small fault
how ugly didst thou in Cordelia show
which like an engine wrench'd my frame of nature
from the fix'd place drew from my heart all love
and added to the gall O Lear Lear Lear
beat at this gate that let thy folly in

and thy dear judgment out Go go my people

my lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant

it may be so my lord
hear Nature hear dear goddess hear
suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
to make this creature fruitful
into her womb convey sterility
dry up in her the organs of increase
and from her derogate body never spring
a babe to honour her If she must teem
create her child of spleen that it may live
and be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her
let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth
with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks
turn all her mother's pains and benefits
to laughter and contempt that she may feel
how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
to have a thankless child Away away



never afflict yourself to know the cause
but let his disposition have that scope
that dotage gives it


what fifty of my followers at a clap
within a fortnight

what's the matter sir

I'll tell thee

life and death I am asham'd
that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus
that these hot tears which break from me perforce
should make thee worth them Blasts and fogs upon thee
th' untented woundings of a father's curse
pierce every sense about thee Old fond eyes
and cast you with the waters that you lose
to temper clay Yea is it come to this
let it be so I have another daughter
who I am sure is kind and comfortable
when she shall hear this of thee with her nails
she'll flay thy wolvish visage Thou shalt find
that I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever thou shalt I warrant thee


do you mark that

I cannot be so partial Goneril
to the great love I bear you

pray you content What Oswald ho


you sir more knave than fool after your master
nuncle Lear nuncle Lear tarry and take the fool with thee

a fox when one has caught her
and such a daughter
should sure to the slaughter
if my cap would buy a halter
so the fool follows after

this man hath had good counsel A hundred knights
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
at point a hundred knights yes that on every dream
each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike
he may enguard his dotage with their powers
and hold our lives in mercy Oswald I say

well you may fear too far

safer than trust too far
let me still take away the harms I fear
what he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
if she sustain him and his hundred knights
when I have show'd the unfitness


how now Oswald

what have you writ that letter to my sister

ay madam

take you some company and away to horse
inform her full of my particular fear
and thereto add such reasons of your own
as may compact it more Get you gone
and hasten your return

no no my lord
this milky gentleness and course of yours
you are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
than prais'd for harmful mildness

how far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell
striving to better oft we mar what's well

nay then

well well the event


go you before to Gloucester with these letters Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you know than comes from her demand out of the letter If your diligence be not speedy I shall be there before you

I will not sleep my lord till I have delivered your letter


if a man's brains were in s heels were't not in danger of kibes

ay boy
then I prithee be merry thy wit shall not go slip-shod

ha ha ha

shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly for though she's as like this as a crab is like an apple yet I can tell what I can tell

what canst tell boy

she will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i' the middle on s face

no

why to keep one's eyes of either side's nose that what a man cannot smell out he may spy into

I did her wrong

canst tell how an oyster makes his shell

no
nor I neither but I can tell why a snail has a house

why

why to put his head in not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case

I will forget my nature So kind a father Be my horses ready

thy asses are gone about em The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason

because they are not eight

yes indeed thou wouldst make a good fool

to take it again perforce Monster ingratitude

if thou wert my fool nuncle I'd have thee beaten for being old before thy time

how's that
thou shouldst not have been old before thou hadst been wise

O let me not be mad not mad sweet heaven
keep me in temper I would not be mad

how now Are the horses ready

ready my lord

come boy

she that's a maid now and laughs at my departure
shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter

save thee Curan

and you sir I have been with your father and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him to-night

how comes that
nay I know not You have heard of the news abroad I mean the whispered ones for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments

not I pray you what are they

have you heard of no likely wars toward twixt the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany

not a word

you may do then in time Fare you well sir


the duke be here to-night The better best
this weaves itself perforce into my business
my father hath set guard to take my brother
and I have one thing of a queasy question
which I must act Briefness and fortune work
brother a word descend brother I say


intelligence is given where you are hid
you have now the good advantage of the night
have you not spoken gainst the Duke of Cornwall
he's coming hither now i' the night i' the haste
and Regan with him have you nothing said
upon his party gainst the Duke of Albany

advise yourself

I am sure on t not a word

I hear my father coming pardon me
in cunning I must draw my sword upon you
draw seem to defend yourself now quit you well
yield come before my father Light ho here
fly brother Torches torches So farewell

some blood drawn on me would beget opinion

do more than this in sport Father father
stop stop No help


now Edmund where's the villain

here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out
mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon
to stand auspicious mistress

but where is he

look sir I bleed

where is the villain Edmund

fled this way sir When by no means he could

pursue him ho Go after
'By no means' what

persuade me to the murder of your lordship
but that I told him the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend
spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
the child was bound to the father sir in fine
seeing how loathly opposite I stood
to his unnatural purpose in fell motion
with his prepared sword he charges home
my unprovided body lanc'd mine arm
but when he saw my best alarum'd spirits
bold in the quarrel's right rous'd to the encounter
or whether gasted by the noise I made
full suddenly he fled

let him fly far
not in this land shall he remain uncaught
and found dispatch The noble duke my master
by his authority I will proclaim it
that he which finds him shall deserve our thanks
bringing the murderous coward to the stake
he that conceals him death

when I dissuaded him from his intent
and found him pight to do it with curst speech
I threaten'd to discover him he replied
'Thou unpossessing bastard dost thou think
if I would stand against thee would the reposal
of any trust virtue or worth in thee
make thy words faith'd No what I should deny
as this I would ay though thou didst produce
my very character I'd turn it all
to thy suggestion plot and damned practice
and thou must make a dullard of the world
if they not thought the profits of my death
were very pregnant and potential spurs
to make thee seek it
strong and fasten'd villain
would he deny his letter I never got him

hark the duke's trumpets I know not why he comes
all ports I'll bar the villain shall not scape
the duke must grant me that besides his picture
I will send far and near that all the kingdom
may have due note of him and of my land
loyal and natural boy I'll work the means
to make thee capable


how now my noble friend since I came hither
which I can call but now I have heard strange news

if it be true all vengeance comes too short
which can pursue the offender How dost my lord

O madam my old heart is crack'd it's crack'd
what did my father's godson seek your life
he whom my father nam'd your Edgar

O lady lady shame would have it hid

was he not companion with the riotous knights
that tend upon my father

I know not madam tis too bad too bad

yes madam he was of that consort

no marvel then though he were ill affected
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death
to have the expense and waste of his revenues
I have this present evening from my sister
been well-inform'd of them and with such cautions
that if they come to sojourn at my house
I'll not be there
nor I assure thee Regan
Edmund I hear that you have shown your father
a child-like office

'Twas my duty sir

he did bewray his practice and receiv'd
this hurt you see striving to apprehend him

is he pursu'd

ay my good lord

if he be taken he shall never more
be fear'd of doing harm make your own purpose
how in my strength you please For you Edmund
whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
so much commend itself you shall be ours
natures of such deep trust we shall much need

I shall serve you sir
truly however else

for him I thank your Grace

you know not why we came to visit you

thus out of season threading dark-ey'd night
occasions noble Gloucester of some prize
wherein we must have use of your advice
our father he hath writ so hath our sister
of differences which I best thought it fit
to answer from our home the several messengers
from hence attend dispatch Our good old friend
lay comforts to your bosom and bestow
your needful counsel to our businesses
which craves the instant use

your Graces are right welcome


good dawning to thee friend art of this house

ay

where may we set our horses

i' the mire

prithee if thou lovest me tell me

I love thee not

why then I care not for thee

if I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold I would make thee care for me


fellow I know thee

what dost thou know me for

a knave a rascal an eater of broken meats a base proud shallow beggarly three-suited hundred-pound filthy worsted-stocking knave a lily-liver'd action-taking knave a whoreson glass-gazing superserviceable finical rogue one-trunk-inheriting slave one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service and art nothing but the composition of a knave beggar coward pandar and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch one whom I will beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition

why what a monstrous fellow art thou thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee

what a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me Is it two days since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king Draw you rogue for though it be night yet the moon shines I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you

draw you whoreson cullionly barber-monger draw

away I have nothing to do with thee

draw you rascal you come with letters against the king and take vanity the pupet's part against the royalty of her father Draw you rogue or I'll so carbonado your shanks draw you rascal come your ways

help ho murder help



help oh murder murder


how now What's the matter


with you goodman boy if you please come
I'll flesh ye come on young master


weapons arms What's the matter here

keep peace upon your lives
he dies that strikes again What is the matter

the messengers from our sister and the king


I am scarce in breath my lord

no marvel you have so bestirred your valour You cowardly rascal nature disclaims in thee a tailor made thee

thou art a strange fellow a tailor make a man

ay a tailor sir a stone-cutter or a painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two hours o' the trade

speak yet how grew your quarrel

this ancient ruffian sir whose life I have spar'd at suit of his grey beard

thou whoreson zed thou unnecessary letter My lord if you will give me leave I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him Spare my grey beard you wagtail

peace sirrah
you beastly knave know you no reverence

yes sir but anger hath a privilege
why art thou angry

that such a slave as this should wear a sword
who wears no honesty Such smiling rogues as these
like rats oft bite the holy cords a-twain
which are too intrinse t' unloose smooth every passion
that in the natures of their lords rebel
bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods
renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
with every gale and vary of their masters
knowing nought like dogs but following
a plague upon your epileptic visage
smile you my speeches as I were a fool
goose if I had you upon Sarum plain
I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot

what art thou mad old fellow

how fell you out say that
no contraries hold more antipathy
than I and such a knave

why dost thou call him knave What is his fault

his countenance likes me not

no more perchance does mine nor his nor hers

sir tis my occupation to be plain
I have seen better faces in my time
than stands on any shoulder that I see
before me at this instant

this is some fellow
who having been prais'd for bluntness doth affect
a saucy roughness and constrains the garb
quite from his nature he cannot flatter he
an honest mind and plain he must speak truth
these kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
than twenty silly-ducking observants
that stretch their duties nicely

sir in good sooth in sincere verity
under the allowance of your grand aspect
whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
on flickering Ph bus' front

what mean'st by this

to go out of my dialect which you discommend so much I know sir I am no flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave which for my part I will not be though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to t

what was the offence you gave him

I never gave him any
it pleas'd the king his master very late
to strike at me upon his misconstruction
tripp'd me behind being down insulted rail'd
and put upon him such a deal of man
that worthied him got praises of the king
for him attempting who was self-subdu'd
and in the fleshment of this dread exploit
drew on me here again

none of these rogues and cowards
but Ajax is their fool

fetch forth the stocks
you stubborn ancient knave you reverend braggart
we'll teach you

sir I am too old to learn
call not your stocks for me I serve the king
on whose employment I was sent to you
you shall do small respect show too bold malice
against the grace and person of my master

fetch forth the stocks As I have life and honour
there shall he sit till noon

till noon Till night my lord and all night too

why madam if I were your father's dog
you should not use me so

sir being his knave I will

this is a fellow of the self-same colour
our sister speaks of Come bring away the stocks


let me beseech your Grace not to do so
his fault is much and the good king his master
will check him for't your purpos'd low correction
is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
are punish'd with the king must take it ill
that he so slightly valu'd in his messenger
should have him thus restrain'd

I'll answer that

my sister may receive it much more worse
to have her gentleman abus'd assaulted
for following her affairs Put in his legs

come my good lord away


I am sorry for thee friend tis the duke's pleasure
whose disposition all the world well knows
will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd I'll entreat for thee

pray do not sir I have watch'd and travell'd hard
some time I shall sleep out the rest I'll whistle
give you good morrow

the duke's to blame in this twill be ill taken


good king that must approve the common saw
thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
to the warm sun
approach thou beacon to this under globe
that by thy comfortable beams I may
peruse this letter Nothing almost sees miracles
but misery I know tis from Cordelia
who hath most fortunately been inform'd
of my obscured course and shall find time
from this enormous state seeking to give
losses their remedies All weary and o'erwatch'd
take vantage heavy eyes not to behold
this shameful lodging
fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel

I heard myself proclaim'd
and by the happy hollow of a tree
escap'd the hunt No port is free no place
that guard and most unusual vigilance
does not attend my taking While I may scape
I will preserve myself and am bethought
to take the basest and most poorest shape
that ever penury in contempt of man
brought near to beast my face I'll grime with filth
blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
and with presented nakedness outface
the winds and persecutions of the sky
the country gives me proof and precedent
of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
and with this horrible object from low farms
poor pelting villages sheep-cotes and mills
enforce their charity Poor Turlygood poor Tom
that's something yet Edgar I nothing am


'Tis strange that they should so depart from home
and not send back my messenger

as I learn'd
the night before there was no purpose in them
of this remove

hail to thee noble master

ha
mak'st thou this shame thy pastime

no my lord

ha ha he wears cruel garters Horses are tied by the head dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by the loins and men by the legs when a man is over-lusty at legs then he wears wooden nether-stocks
what's he that hath so much thy place mistook
to set thee here

it is both he and she
your son and daughter

no

yes

no I say

I say yea

no no they would not

yes they have

by Jupiter I swear no
by Juno I swear ay

they durst not do't
they could not would not do t tis worse than murder
to do upon respect such violent outrage
resolve me with all modest haste which way
thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
coming from us

my lord when at their home
I did commend your highness' letters to them
ere I was risen from the place that show'd
my duty kneeling there came a reeking post
stew'd in his haste half breathless panting forth
from Goneril his mistress salutations
deliver'd letters spite of intermission
which presently they read on whose contents
they summon'd up their meiny straight took horse
commanded me to follow and attend
and meeting here the other messenger
whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine
being the very fellow which of late
display'd so saucily against your highness
having more man than wit about me drew
he rais'd the house with loud and coward cries
your son and daughter found this trespass worth
the shame which here it suffers

winter's not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way

fathers that wear rags
do make their children blind
but fathers that bear bags
shall see their children kind
fortune that arrant whore
ne'er turns the key to the poor

but for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year
O how this mother swells up toward my heart
hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow
thy element's below Where is this daughter

with the earl sir here within

follow me not stay here


made you no more offence than what you speak of

none
how chance the king comes with so small a number

an thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that question thou hadst well deserved it

why fool

we'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there's no labouring i' the winter All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following it but the great one that goes up the hill let him draw thee after When a wise man gives thee better counsel give me mine again I would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
that sir which serves and seeks for gain
and follows but for form
will pack when it begins to rain
and leave thee in the storm
but I will tarry the fool will stay
and let the wise man fly
the knave turns fool that runs away
the fool no knave perdy


where learn'd you this fool

not i' the stocks fool


deny to speak with me They are sick they are weary
they have travell'd hard to-night Mere fetches
the images of revolt and flying off
fetch me a better answer
my dear lord
you know the fiery quality of the duke
how unremovable and fix'd he is
in his own course

vengeance plague death confusion
fiery what quality Why Gloucester Gloucester
I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife

well my good lord I have inform'd them so

inform'd them Dost thou understand me man

ay my good lord

the king would speak with Cornwall the dear father
would with his daughter speak commands her service
are they inform'd of this My breath and blood
fiery the fiery duke Tell the hot duke that
infirmity doth still neglect all office
whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves
when nature being oppress'd commands the mind
to suffer with the body I'll forbear
and am fall'n out with my more headier will
to take the indispos'd and sickly fit
for the sound man Death on my state

wherefore
should he sit here This act persuades me
that this remotion of the duke and her
is practice only Give me my servant forth
go tell the duke and's wife I'd speak with them
now presently bid them come forth and hear me
or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
till it cry sleep to death

I would have all well betwixt you

O me my heart my rising heart but down

cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels when she put em i' the paste alive she knapped em o' the coxcombs with a stick and cried Down wantons down Twas her brother that in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay


good morrow to you both

hail to your Grace


I am glad to see your highness

Regan I think you are I know what reason
I have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb
sepulchring an adult'ress

O are you free
some other time for that Beloved Regan
sharp-tooth'd unkindness like a vulture here

I can scarce speak to thee thou'lt not believe
with how deprav'd a quality O Regan

I pray you sir take patience I have hope
you less know how to value her desert
than she to scant her duty

say how is that

I cannot think my sister in the least
would fail her obligation if sir perchance
she have restrain'd the riots of your followers
'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end
as clears her from all blame

my curses on her

nature in you stands on the very verge
of her confine you should be rul'd and led
by some discretion that discerns your state
better than you yourself Therefore I pray you
that to our sister you do make return
say you have wrong'd her sir

ask her forgiveness
do you but mark how this becomes the house
'Dear daughter I confess that I am old
age is unnecessary on my knees I beg

that you'll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food

good sir no more these are unsightly tricks
return you to my sister

never Regan
she hath abated me of half my train
most serpent-like upon the very heart
all the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
on her ingrateful top Strike her young bones
you taking airs with lameness

fie air fie

you nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames
into her scornful eyes Infect her beauty
you fen-suck'd fogs drawn by the powerful sun
to fall and blast her pride

O the blest gods So will you wish on me
when the rash mood is on

no Regan thou shalt never have my curse
thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
thee o'er to harshness her eyes are fierce but thine
do comfort and not burn Tis not in thee
to bandy hasty words to scant my sizes
and in conclusion to oppose the bolt
against my coming in thou better know'st
the offices of nature bond of childhood
effects of courtesy dues of gratitude
thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot
wherein I thee endow'd

good sir to the purpose

who put my man i' the stocks


what trumpet's that

I know't my sister's this approves her letter
that she would soon be here Is your lady come


dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows
out varlet from my sight

what means your Grace

who stock'd my servant Regan I have good hope
thou didst not know on t Who comes here O heavens


if you do love old men if your sweet sway
allow obedience if yourselves are old
make it your cause send down and take my part


art not asham'd to look upon this beard

O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand

why not by the hand sir How have I offended
and dotage terms so

O sides you are too tough
will you yet hold How came my man i' the stocks

I set him there sir but his own disorders
deserv'd much less advancement

you did you

I pray you father being weak seem so
if till the expiration of your month
you will return and sojourn with my sister
dismissing half your train come then to me
I am now from home and out of that provision
which shall be needful for your entertainment

return to her and fifty men dismiss'd
no rather I abjure all roofs and choose
to be a comrade with the wolf and owl
necessity's sharp pinch Return with her
why the hot-blooded France that dowerless took
our youngest born I could as well be brought
to knee his throne and squire-like pension beg
to keep base life afoot Return with her
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
to this detested groom


at your choice sir

I prithee daughter do not make me mad
I will not trouble thee my child farewell
we'll no more meet no more see one another
but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
or rather a disease that's in my flesh
which I must needs call mine thou art a boil
a plague-sore an embossed carbuncle
let shame come when it will I do not call it
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot
nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove
mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
I can be patient I can stay with Regan
I and my hundred knights

not altogether so
I look'd not for you yet nor am provided
for your fit welcome Give ear sir to my sister
for those that mingle reason with your passion
must be content to think you old and so
but she knows what she does

is this well spoken

I dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
is it not well What should you need of more
yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
should many people under two commands
hold amity Tis hard almost impossible

why might not you my lord receive attendance
from those that she calls servants or from mine

why not my lord If then they chanc'd to slack you
we could control them If you will come to me
for now I spy a danger I entreat you
to bring but five-and-twenty to no more
will I give place or notice

I gave you all

and in good time you gave it

made you my guardians my depositaries
but kept a reservation to be follow'd
with such a number What must I come to you

and speak't again my lord no more with me

those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
when others are more wicked not being the worst
stands in some rank of praise

I'll go with thee
thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty
and thou art twice her love

hear me my lord
what need you five-and-twenty ten or five
to follow in a house where twice so many
have a command to tend you

what need one

O reason not the need our basest beggars
allow not nature more than nature needs
man's life is cheap as beast's Thou art a lady
if only to go warm were gorgeous
why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
which scarcely keeps thee warm But for true need
you heavens give me that patience patience I need
you see me here you gods a poor old man
as full of grief as age wretched in both
if it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
against their father fool me not so much
to bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
and let not women's weapons water-drops
stain my man's cheeks No you unnatural hags
I will have such revenges on you both
that all the world shall I will do such things
what they are yet I know not but they shall be
the terrors of the earth You think I'll weep
no I'll not weep
I have full cause of weeping but this heart
or ere I'll weep O fool I shall go mad


let us withdraw twill be a storm


this house is little the old man and his people
cannot be well bestow'd

'Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest
and must needs taste his folly

for his particular I'll receive him gladly
but not one follower

so am I purpos'd
where is my Lord of Gloucester

follow'd the old man forth He is return'd

the king is in high rage

whither is he going

he calls to horse but will I know not whither

'Tis best to give him way he leads himself

my lord entreat him by no means to stay

alack the night comes on and the bleak winds
do sorely ruffle for many miles about
there's scarce a bush

O sir to wilful men
the injuries that they themselves procure
must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors
he is attended with a desperate train
to have his ear abus'd wisdom bids fear

shut up your doors my lord tis a wild night
my Regan counsels well come out o' the storm

who's here beside foul weather

one minded like the weather most unquietly

I know you Where's the king

contending with the fretful elements
bids the wind blow the earth into the sea
or swell the curled waters bove the main
that things might change or cease tears his white hair
which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
catch in their fury and make nothing of
strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
the to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain
the lion and the belly-pinched wolf
keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
and bids what will take all

but who is with him

none but the fool who labours to out-jest
his heart-struck injuries

sir I do know you
and dare upon the warrant of my note
commend a dear thing to you There is division
although as yet the face of it be cover'd
with mutual cunning twixt Albany and Cornwall
who have as who have not that their great stars
thron'd and set high servants who seem no less
which are to France the spies and speculations
intelligent of our state what hath been seen
either in snuffs and packings of the dukes
against the old kind king or something deeper
whereof perchance these are but furnishings
but true it is from France there comes a power
into this scatter'd kingdom who already
wise in our negligence have secret feet
in some of our best ports and are at point
to show their open banner Now to you
if on my credit you dare build so far
to make your speed to Dover you shall find
some that will thank you making just report
of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
the king hath cause to plain
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding
and from some knowledge and assurance offer
this office to you

I will talk further with you

no do not
than my out-wall open this purse and take
what it contains If you shall see Cordelia
as doubt not but you shall show her this ring
and she will tell you who your fellow is
that yet you do not know Fie on this storm
I will go seek the king

give me your hand Have you no more to say

few words but to effect more than all yet
that when we have found the king in which your pain
that way I'll this he that first lights on him
holla the other


blow winds and crack your cheeks rage blow
you cataracts and hurricanoes spout
till you have drench'd our steeples drown'd the cocks
you sulphurous and thought-executing fires
singe my white head And thou all-shaking thunder
strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world
crack nature's moulds all germens spill at once
that make ingrateful man

O nuncle court holy-water in a dry house is better than this rain-water out o' door Good nuncle in and ask thy daughters' blessing here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool

rumble thy bellyfull Spit fire spout rain
nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters
I tax not you you elements with unkindness
I never gave you kingdom call'd you children
you owe me no subscription then let fall
your horrible pleasure here I stand your slave
a poor infirm weak and despis'd old man
but yet I call you servile ministers
that have with two pernicious daughters join'd
your high-engender'd battles gainst a head
so old and white as this O O tis foul


the cod-piece that will house
before the head has any
the head and he shall louse
so beggars marry many
the man that makes his toe
what he his heart should make
shall of a corn cry woe
and turn his sleep to wake

for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass


no I will be the pattern of all patience I will say nothing

who's there

marry here's grace and a cod-piece that's a wise man and a fool

love not such nights as these the wrathful skies
gallow the very wanderers of the dark
and make them keep their caves Since I was man
such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder
such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
remember to have heard man's nature cannot carry
the affliction nor the fear

let the great gods
that keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads
find out their enemies now Tremble thou wretch
that hast within thee undivulged crimes
unwhipp'd of justice hide thee thou bloody hand
thou perjur'd and thou simular of virtue
that art incestuous caitiff to pieces shake
that under covert and convenient seeming
hast practis'd on man's life close pent-up guilts
rive your concealing continents and cry
these dreadful summoners grace I am a man

alack bare-headed
gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel
some friendship will it lend you gainst the tempest
repose you there while I to this hard house
more harder than the stone whereof tis rais'd
which even but now demanding after you
denied me to come in return and force
their scanted courtesy

my wits begin to turn
come on my boy How dost my boy Art cold
I am cold myself Where is this straw my fellow
the art of our necessities is strange
that can make vile things precious Come your hovel
poor fool and knave I have one part in my heart
that's sorry yet for thee


with hey ho the wind and the rain
must make content with his fortunes fit
though the rain it raineth every day


true my good boy Come bring us to this hovel


this is a brave night to cool a courtezan
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go

when priests are more in word than matter
when brewers mar their malt with water
when nobles are their tailors' tutors
no heretics burn'd but wenches' suitors
when every case in law is right
no squire in debt nor no poor knight
when slanders do not live in tongues
nor cutpurses come not to throngs
and bawds and whores do churches build
then shall the realm of Albion
come to great confusion
then comes the time who lives to see t
that going shall be us'd with feet

this prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before his time


alack alack Edmund I like not this unnatural dealing When I desired their leave that I might pity him they took from me the use of mine own house charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him entreat for him nor any way sustain him

most savage and unnatural

go to say you nothing There is division between the dukes and a worse matter than that I have received a letter this night tis dangerous to be spoken I have locked the letter in my closet These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home there's part of a power already footed we must incline to the king I will seek him and privily relieve him go you and maintain talk with the duke that my charity be not of him perceived If he ask for me I am ill and gone to bed If I die for it as no less is threatened me the king my old master must be relieved There is some strange thing toward Edmund pray you be careful


this courtesy forbid thee shall the duke
instantly know and of that letter too
this seems a fair deserving and must draw me
the younger rises when the old doth fall


here is the place my lord good my lord enter
the tyranny of the open night's too rough
for nature to endure


let me alone

good my lord enter here

wilt break my heart

I'd rather break mine own Good my lord enter

thou think'st tis much that this contentious storm
invades us to the skin so tis to thee
but where the greater malady is fix'd
but if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea
thou'dst meet the bear i' the mouth When the mind's free
the body's delicate the tempest in my mind
doth from my senses take all feeling else
save what beats there Filial ingratitude
is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
for lifting food to t But I will punish home
no I will weep no more In such a night
to shut me out Pour on I will endure
in such a night as this O Regan Goneril
your old kind father whose frank heart gave all
O that way madness lies let me shun that
no more of that

good my lord enter here

prithee go in thyself seek thine own ease
this tempest will not give me leave to ponder
on things would hurt me more But I'll go in

in boy go first You houseless poverty
nay get thee in I'll pray and then I'll sleep

poor naked wretches wheresoe'er you are
that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm
how shall your houseless heads and unfed sides
your loop'd and window'd raggedness defend you
from seasons such as these O I have ta'en
too little care of this Take physic pomp
expose thyself to feel what wretches feel
that thou mayst shake the superflux to them
and show the heavens more just

fathom and half fathom and half Poor Tom


come not in here nuncle here's a spirit
help me help me
give me thy hand Who's there

a spirit a spirit he says his name's poor Tom

what art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw
come forth


away the foul fiend follows me
through the sharp hawthorn blow the winds
hum go to thy cold bed and warm thee

didst thou give all to thy two daughters
and art thou come to this

who gives anything to poor Tom whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame through ford and whirlpool o'er bog and quagmire that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew set ratsbane by his porridge made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting-horse over four-inched bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor Bless thy five wits Tom's a-cold O do de do de do de Bless thee from whirlwinds starblasting and taking Do poor Tom some charity whom the foul fiend vexes There could I have him now and there and there again and there


what have his daughters brought him to this pass

nay he reserved a blanket else we had been all shamed

now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters

he hath no daughters sir

death traitor nothing could have subdu'd nature
to such a lowness but his unkind daughters
is it the fashion that discarded fathers
should have thus little mercy on their flesh
judicious punishment twas this flesh begot
those pelican daughters

pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill
halloo halloo loo loo

this cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen
take heed o' the foul fiend Obey thy parents keep thy word justly swear not commit not with man's sworn spouse set not thy sweet heart on proud array Tom's a-cold

what hast thou been

a servingman proud in heart and mind that curled my hair wore gloves in my cap served the lust of my mistress's heart and did the act of darkness with her swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it Wine loved I deeply dice dearly and in woman out-paramoured the Turk false of heart light of ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox in stealth wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman keep thy foot out of brothels thy hand out of plackets thy pen from lenders' books and defy the foul fiend Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind says suum mun ha no nonny Dolphin my boy my boy sessa let him trot by


why thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies Is man no more than this Consider him well Thou owest the worm no silk the beast no hide the sheep no wool the cat no perfume Ha here's three on's are sophisticated thou art the thing itself unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare forked animal as thou art Off off you lendings Come unbutton here


prithee nuncle be contented tis a naughty night to swim in Now a little fire in a wide field were like an old lecher's heart a small spark all the rest on's body cold Look here comes a walking fire


this is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet he begins at curfew and walks till the first cock he gives the web and the pin squints the eye and makes the harelip mildews the white wheat and hurts the poor creature of earth

swithold footed thrice the old
he met the night-mare and her nine-fold
bid her alight
and her troth plight


how fares your Grace

what's he

who's there What is't you seek

what are you there Your names

poor Tom that eats the swimming frog the toad the tadpole the wall-newt and the water that in the fury of his heart when the foul fiend rages eats cow-dung for sallets swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog drinks the green mantle of the standing pool who is whipped from tithing to tithing and stock-punished and imprisoned who hath had three suits to his back six shirts to his body horse to ride and weapon to wear

but mice and rats and such small deer
have been Tom's food for seven long year

beware my follower Peace Smulkin peace thou fiend

what hath your Grace no better company

Modo he's call'd and Mahu

our flesh and blood my lord is grown so vile
that it doth hate what gets it

poor Tom's a-cold

go in with me My duty cannot suffer
to obey in all your daughters' hard commands
though their injunction be to bar my doors
and let this tyrannous night take hold upon you
yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out
and bring you where both fire and food is ready

first let me talk with this philosopher
what is the cause of thunder

good my lord take his offer go into the house

what is your study

how to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin

let me ask you one word in private

importune him once more to go my lord
his wits begin to unsettle

canst thou blame him

his daughters seek his death Ah that good Kent
he said it would be thus poor banish'd man
thou sayst the king grows mad I'll tell thee friend
I am almost mad myself I had a son
now outlaw'd from my blood he sought my life
but lately very late I lov'd him friend
no father his son dearer true to tell thee

I do beseech your Grace

O cry you mercy sir
noble philosopher your company

Tom's a-cold

in fellow there into the hovel keep thee warm

come let's in all

this way my lord

with him
I will keep still with my philosopher

good my lord soothe him let him take the fellow

take him you on
sirrah come on go along with us

come good Athenian

no words no words hush


child Rowland to the dark tower came
his word was still Fie foh and fum
I smell the blood of a British man

I will have my revenge ere I depart his house

how my lord I may be censured that nature thus gives way to loyalty something fears me to think of

I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil disposition made him seek his death but a provoking merit set a-work by a reproveable badness in himself

how malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just This is the letter he spoke of which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France O heavens that this treason were not or not I the detector


if the matter of this paper be certain you have mighty business in hand

true or false it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester Seek out where thy father is that he may be ready for our apprehension

if I find him comforting the king it will stuff his suspicion more fully I will persever in my course of loyalty though the conflict be sore between that and my blood

I will lay trust upon thee and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love


here is better than the open air take it thankfully I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can I will not be long from you

all the power of his wits has given way to his impatience The gods reward your kindness


frateretto calls me and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness Pray innocent and beware the foul fiend

prithee nuncle tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman


no he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him

to have a thousand with red burning spits
come hizzing in upon em

the foul fiend bites my back

he's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf a horse's health a boy's love or a whore's oath

it shall be done I will arraign them straight


come sit thou here most learned justicer


thou sapient sir sit here Now you she foxes

look where he stands and glares wantest thou eyes at trial madam


her boat hath a leak
and she must not speak
why she dares not come over to thee


the foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring Croak not black angel I have no food for thee

how do you sir Stand you not so amaz'd
will you lie down and rest upon the cushions

I'll see their trial first Bring in their evidence


thou robed man of justice take thy place


and thou his yoke-fellow of equity

you are o' the commission
sit you too

let us deal justly

sleepest or wakest thou jolly shepherd
thy sheep be in the corn
and for one blast of thy minikin mouth
thy sheep shall take no harm

purr the cat is grey

arraign her first tis Goneril I here take my oath before this honourable assembly she kicked the poor king her father

come hither mistress Is your name Goneril

she cannot deny it


and here's another whose warp'd looks proclaim
what store her heart is made on Stop her there
arms arms sword fire Corruption in the place
false justicer why hast thou let her scape

bless thy five wits

O pity Sir where is the patience now
that you so oft have boasted to retain

my tears begin to take his part so much
they'll mar my counterfeiting

the little dogs and all
tray Blanch and Sweet-heart see they bark at me

Tom will throw his head at them
avaunt you curs
be thy mouth or black or white
tooth that poisons if it bite
mastiff greyhound mongrel grim
hound or spaniel brach or lym
or bobtail tike or trundle-tail
Tom will make them weep and wail
for with throwing thus my head
dogs leap the hatch and all are fled

do de de de Sessa Come march to wakes and fairs and market-towns Poor Tom thy horn is dry

then let them anatomize Regan see what breeds about her heart Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts

you sir I entertain you for one of my hundred only I do not like the fashion of your garments you will say they are Persian attire but let them be changed

now good my lord lie here and rest awhile

make no noise make no noise draw the curtains so so so We'll go to supper i' the morning so so so



come hither friend where is the king my master

here sir but trouble him not his wits are gone

good friend I prithee take him in thy arms
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him
there is a litter ready lay him in t
and drive toward Dover friend where thou shalt meet
both welcome and protection Take up thy master
if thou shouldst dally half an hour his life
with thine and all that offer to defend him
stand in assured loss Take up take up
and follow me that will to some provision
give thee quick conduct

oppress'd nature sleeps
this rest might yet have balm'd thy broken sinews
stand in hard cure

come help to bear thy master
thou must not stay behind

come come away


when we our betters see bearing our woes
we scarcely think our miseries our foes
who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind
leaving free things and happy shows behind
but then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip
when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
how light and portable my pain seems now
when that which makes me bend makes the king bow
he childed as I father'd Tom away
mark the high noises and thyself bewray
when false opinion whose wrong thought defiles thee
what will hap more to-night safe scape the king
lurk lurk


post speedily to my lord your husband show him this letter the army of France is landed Seek out the traitor Gloucester


hang him instantly

pluck out his eyes

leave him to my displeasure Edmund keep you our sister company the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding Advise the duke where you are going to a most festinate preparation we are bound to the like Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us Farewell dear sister farewell my Lord of Gloucester

how now Where's the king

my Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence
some five or six and thirty of his knights
hot questrists after him met him at gate
who with some other of the lord's dependants
to have well-armed friends

get horses for your mistress

farewell sweet lord and sister

Edmund farewell

go seek the traitor Gloucester
pinion him like a thief bring him before us

though well we may not pass upon his life
without the form of justice yet our power
shall do a courtesy to our wrath which men
may blame but not control Who's there The traitor


ingrateful fox tis he


what mean your Graces Good my friends consider
you are my guests do me no foul play friends

bind him I say


hard hard O filthy traitor

unmerciful lady as you are I'm none

to this chair bind him Villain thou shalt find


by the kind gods tis most ignobly done
to pluck me by the beard

so white and such a traitor

these hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
will quicken and accuse thee I am your host
with robbers' hands my hospitable favours
you should not ruffle thus What will you do

come sir what letters had you late from France

be simple-answer'd for we know the truth

and what confederacy have you with the traitors
late footed in the kingdom

to whose hands have you sent the lunatic king
speak

I have a letter guessingly set down
which came from one that's of a neutral heart
and not from one oppos'd


and false

where hast thou sent the king

to Dover

wherefore to Dover Wast thou not charg'd at peril

wherefore to Dover Let him answer that

I am tied to the stake and I must stand the course

wherefore to Dover

because I would not see thy cruel nails
pluck out his poor old eyes nor thy fierce sister
in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs
the sea with such a storm as his bare head
and quench'd the stelled fires
yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain
if wolves had at thy gate howl'd that dern time
thou shouldst have said Good porter turn the key
all cruels else subscrib'd but I shall see
the winged vengeance overtake such children

see t shalt thou never Fellows hold the chair
upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot

he that will think to live till he be old
give me some help O cruel O ye gods


one side will mock another the other too

if you see vengeance

hold your hand my lord
but better service have I never done you
than now to bid you hold

how now you dog

if you did wear a beard upon your chin
I'd shake it on this quarrel What do you mean

my villain


nay then come on and take the chance of anger


give me thy sword A peasant stand up thus


O I am slain My lord you have one eye left
to see some mischief on him O

lest it see more prevent it Out vile jelly
where is thy lustre now

all dark and comfortless Where's my son Edmund
Edmund enkindle all the sparks of nature
to quit this horrid act

out treacherous villain
thou call'st on him that hates thee it was he
that made the overture of thy treasons to us
who is too good to pity thee

O my follies Then Edgar was abus'd
kind gods forgive me that and prosper him

go thrust him out at gates and let him smell
his way to Dover


I have receiv'd a hurt Follow me lady
turn out that eyeless villain throw this slave
upon the dunghill Regan I bleed apace
untimely comes this hurt Give me your arm


I'll never care what wickedness I do
if this man come to good

if she live long
and in the end meet the old course of death
women will all turn monsters

let's follow the old earl and get the Bedlam
to lead him where he would his roguish madness
allows itself to any thing

go thou I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs

yet better thus and known to be contemn'd
than still contemn'd and flatter'd To be worst
the lowest and most dejected thing of fortune
stands still in esperance lives not in fear
the lamentable change is from the best
the worst returns to laughter Welcome then
thou unsubstantial air that I embrace
the wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
owes nothing to thy blasts But who comes here


my father poorly led World world O world
but that thy strange mutations make us hate thee

life would not yield to age

O my good lord
I have been your tenant and your father's tenant

away get thee away good friend be gone
thy comforts can do me no good at all
thee they may hurt

you cannot see your way

I have no way and therefore want no eyes
I stumbled when I saw Full oft tis seen
our means secure us and our mere defects
prove our commodities Ah dear son Edgar
the food of thy abused father's wrath
might I but live to see thee in my touch
I'd say I had eyes again

how now Who's there

O gods Who is t can say I am at the worst
I am worse than e'er I was
'Tis poor mad Tom

and worse I may be yet the worst is not
so long as we can say This is the worst

fellow where goest

is it a beggar-man

madman and beggar too

he has some reason else he could not beg
i' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw
which made me think a man a worm my son
came then into my mind and yet my mind
was then scarce friends with him I have heard more since
as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods
they kill us for their sport

bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow
angering itself and others

bless thee master

is that the naked fellow

ay my lord

then prithee get thee gone If for my sake
thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain
i' the way toward Dover do it for ancient love
and bring some covering for this naked soul
who I'll entreat to lead me

alack sir he is mad

'Tis the times' plague when madmen lead the blind
do as I bid thee or rather do thy pleasure

I'll bring him the best parel that I have
come on t what will


sirrah naked fellow

poor Tom's a-cold

I cannot daub it further

come hither fellow

and yet I must Bless thy sweet eyes they bleed

know'st thou the way to Dover

both stile and gate horse-way and footpath Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits bless thee good man's son from the foul fiend Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once of lust as Obidicut Hobbididance prince of dumbness Mahu of stealing Modo of murder and Flibbertigibbet of mopping and mowing who since possesses chambermaids and waiting-women So bless thee master

have humbled to all strokes that I am wretched
makes thee the happier heavens deal so still
let the superfluous and lust-dieted man
that slaves your ordinance that will not see
because he doth not feel feel your power quickly
so distribution should undo excess
and each man have enough Dost thou know Dover

ay master

there is a cliff whose high and bending head
looks fearfully in the confined deep
bring me but to the very brim of it
and I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
with something rich about me from that place
I shall no leading need

give me thy arm
poor Tom shall lead thee

welcome my lord I marvel our mild husband
not met us on the way

now where's your master

madam within but never man so chang'd
I told him of the army that was landed
he smil'd at it I told him you were coming
his answer was The worse of Gloucester's treachery
and of the loyal service of his son
when I inform'd him then he call'd me sot
and told me I had turn'd the wrong side out
what most he should dislike seems pleasant to him
what like offensive

then shall you go no further
it is the cowish terror of his spirit
that dares not undertake he'll not feel wrongs
may prove effects Back Edmund to my brother
hasten his musters and conduct his powers
I must change arms at home and give the distaff
into my husband's hands This trusty servant
shall pass between us ere long you are like to hear
if you dare venture in your own behalf
a mistress's command Wear this spare speech

decline your head this kiss if it durst speak
would stretch thy spirits up into the air
conceive and fare thee well

yours in the ranks of death

my most dear Gloucester

O the difference of man and man
to thee a woman's services are due
my fool usurps my bed
madam here comes my lord

I have been worth the whistle

O Goneril
you are not worth the dust which the rude wind
blows in your face I fear your disposition
that nature which contemns its origin
cannot be border'd certain in itself
she that herself will sliver and disbranch
from her material sap perforce must wither
and come to deadly use

no more the text is foolish

wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
filths savour but themselves What have you done
tigers not daughters what have you perform'd
a father and a gracious aged man
most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
could my good brother suffer you to do it
a man a prince by him so benefited
if that the heavens do not their visible spirits
send quickly down to tame these vile offences
it will come
humanity must perforce prey on itself
like monsters of the deep

milk-liver'd man
that bear'st a cheek for blows a head for wrongs
who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
thine honour from thy suffering that not know'st
fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
ere they have done their mischief Where's thy drum
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land
with plumed helm thy slayer begins threats
whilst thou a moral fool sitt'st still and criest
'Alack why does he so
see thyself devil
proper deformity seems not in the fiend
so horrid as in woman

O vain fool

thou changed and self-cover'd thing for shame
be-monster not thy feature Were t my fitness
to let these hands obey my blood
they are apt enough to dislocate and tear
thy flesh and bones howe'er thou art a fiend
a woman's shape doth shield thee

marry your manhood Mew


what news

O my good lord the Duke of Cornwall's dead
the other eye of Gloucester

Gloucester's eyes

a servant that he bred thrill'd with remorse
oppos'd against the act bending his sword
to his great master who thereat enrag'd
flew on him and amongst them fell'd him dead
but not without that harmful stroke which since
hath pluck'd him after

this shows you are above
you justicers that these our nether crimes
so speedily can venge But O poor Gloucester
lost he his other eye

both both my lord
this letter madam craves a speedy answer
'Tis from your sister
one way I like this well
but being widow and my Gloucester with her
may all the building in my fancy pluck
upon my hateful life another way
this news is not so tart

I'll read and answer


where was his son when they did take his eyes

come with my lady hither

he is not here

no my good lord I met him back again

knows he the wickedness

and quit the house on purpose that their punishment
might have the freer course

Gloucester I live
to thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king
and to revenge thine eyes Come hither friend
tell me what more thou knowest


why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason

something he left imperfect in the state which since his coming forth is thought of which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary

who hath he left behind him general

the Marshal of France Monsieur la Far

did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief

and now and then an ample tear trill'd down
her delicate cheek it seem'd she was a queen
over her passion who most rebel-like
sought to be king o'er her

O then it mov'd her

not to a rage patience and sorrow strove
who should express her goodliest You have seen
sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
were like a better way those happy smilets
that play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
what guests were in her eyes which parted thence
as pearls from diamonds dropp'd In brief
sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd
if all could so become it

made she no verbal question

pantingly forth as if it press'd her heart
cried Sisters sisters Shame of ladies sisters
Kent father sisters What i' the storm i' the night
let pity not be believed There she shook
the holy water from her heavenly eyes
and clamour-moisten'd then away she started
to deal with grief alone

it is the stars
the stars above us govern our conditions
else one self mate and make could not beget
such different issues You spoke not with her since

no

was this before the king return'd

no since

who sometime in his better tune remembers
what we are come about and by no means
will yield to see his daughter

why good sir

a sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness
that stripp'd her from his benediction turn'd her
to foreign casualties gave her dear rights
to his dog-hearted daughters these things sting
his mind so venomously that burning shame
detains him from Cordelia

alack poor gentleman

of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not

'Tis so they are afoot

and leave you to attend him Some dear cause
will in concealment wrap me up awhile
when I am known aright you shall not grieve
lending me this acquaintance I pray you go
along with me


alack tis he why he was met even now
as mad as the vex'd sea singing aloud
crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds
with burdocks hemlock nettles cuckoo-flowers
darnel and all the idle weeds that grow
in our sustaining corn A century send forth
search every acre in the high-grown field
and bring him to our eye

what can man's wisdom
in the restoring his bereaved sense
he that helps him take all my outward worth
there is means madam
our foster-nurse of nature is repose
the which he lacks that to provoke in him
are many simples operative whose power
will close the eye of anguish

all bless'd secrets
all you unpublish'd virtues of the earth
spring with my tears be aidant and remediate
in the good man's distress Seek seek for him
lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
that wants the means to lead it


news madam
the British powers are marching hitherward

'Tis known before our preparation stands
in expectation of them O dear father
therefore great France
my mourning and important tears hath pitied
no blown ambition doth our arms incite
but love dear love and our ag'd father's right
soon may I hear and see him


but are my brother's powers set forth

ay madam

himself in person there

madam with much ado
your sister is the better soldier

lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home

no madam
what might import my sister's letter to him

I know not lady

faith he is posted hence on serious matter
it was great ignorance Gloucester's eyes being out
to let him live where he arrives he moves
all hearts against us Edmund I think is gone
in pity of his misery to dispatch
his nighted life moreover to descry
the strength o' the enemy

I must needs after him madam with my letter

our troops set forth to-morrow stay with us
the ways are dangerous

I may not madam
my lady charg'd my duty in this business
why should she write to Edmund Might not you
transport her purposes by word Belike
something I know not what I'll love thee much
let me unseal the letter

madam I had rather

I know your lady does not love her husband
I am sure of that and at her late being here
she gave strange ceilliades and most speaking looks
to noble Edmund I know you are of her bosom

I madam

I speak in understanding you are I know't
therefore I do advise you take this note
my lord is dead Edmund and I have talk'd
and more convenient is he for my hand
than for your lady's You may gather more
and when your mistress hears thus much from you
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her
so fare you well
if you do chance to hear of that blind traitor
preferment falls on him that cuts him off

would I could meet him madam I would show
what party I do follow

fare thee well


when shall I come to the top of that same hill

you do climb up it now look how we labour

methinks the ground is even

horrible steep

no truly

why then you other senses grow imperfect
by your eyes' anguish

so may it be indeed
methinks thy voice is alter'd and thou speak'st
in better phrase and matter than thou didst

y'are much deceiv'd in nothing am I chang'd
but in my garments

methinks you're better spoken

come on sir here's the place stand still
how fearful
and dizzy tis to cast one's eyes so low
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air
hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade
methinks he seems no bigger than his head
the fishermen that walk upon the beach
appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
diminish'd to her cock her cock a buoy
almost too small for sight The murmuring surge
that on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes
cannot be heard so high I'll look no more
lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
topple down headlong

set me where you stand

give me your hand you are now within a foot
of the extreme verge for all beneath the moon
would I not leap upright

let go my hand
here friend s another purse in it a jewel
prosper it with thee Go thou further off
bid me farewell and let me hear thee going

now fare you well good sir


with all my heart

why I do trifle thus with his despair
is done to cure it

O you mighty gods
this world I do renounce and in your sights
shake patiently my great affliction off
if I could bear it longer and not fall
to quarrel with your great opposeless wills
my snuff and loathed part of nature should
burn itself out If Edgar live O bless him
now fellow fare thee well

gone sir farewell


and yet I know not how conceit may rob
the treasury of life when life itself
yields to the theft had he been where he thought
by this had thought been past Alive or dead


ho you sir friend Hear you sir speak
thus might he pass indeed yet he revives
what are you sir

away and let me die

hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air
so many fathom down precipitating
thou'dst shiver'd like an egg but thou dost breathe
ten masts at each make not the altitude
which thou hast perpendicularly fell
thy life's a miracle Speak yet again

but have I fallen or no

from the dread summit of this chalky bourn
look up a-height the shrill-gorg'd lark so far
cannot be seen or heard do but look up

alack I have no eyes
is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
to end itself by death Twas yet some comfort
when misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
and frustrate his proud will

give me your arm
up so How is t Feel you your legs You stand


this is above all strangeness
upon the crown o' the cliff what thing was that
which parted from you

a poor unfortunate beggar

as I stood here below methought his eyes
were two full moons he had a thousand noses
horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea
it was some fiend therefore thou happy father
think that the clearest gods who make them honours
of men's impossibilities have preserv'd thee

I do remember now henceforth I'll bear
affliction till it do cry out itself
'Enough enough and die That thing you speak of
I took it for a man often twould say
'The fiend the fiend he led me to that place
bear free and patient thoughts But who comes here


the safer sense will ne'er accommodate

his master thus

no they cannot touch me for coining
I am the king himself

O thou side-piercing sight

nature's above art in that respect There's your press-money That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper draw me a clothier's yard Look look a mouse Peace peace this piece of toasted cheese will do t There's my gauntlet I'll prove it on a giant Bring up the brown bills O well flown bird i' the clout i' the clout hewgh Give the word

sweet marjoram

pass

I know that voice
ha Goneril with a white beard They flatter'd me like a dog and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there To say ay' and no' to everything I said Ay' and no' too was no good divinity When the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would not peace at my bidding there I found em there I smelt em out Go to they are not men o' their words they told me I was every thing tis a lie I am not ague-proof

the trick of that voice I do well remember
is t not the king

ay every inch a king
when I do stare see how the subject quakes
I pardon that man's life What was thy cause
adultery
thou shalt not die die for adultery No
the wren goes to t and the small gilded fly
does lecher in my sight
let copulation thrive for Gloucester's bastard son
was kinder to his father than my daughters
got tween the lawful sheets
to t luxury pell-mell for I lack soldiers
behold yond simpering dame
whose face between her forks presageth snow
that minces virtue and does shake the head
the fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to t
with a more riotous appetite
down from the waist they are Centaurs
though women all above
but to the girdle do the gods inherit
beneath is all the fiends'
there's hell there's darkness there is the sulphurous pit
burning scalding stench consumption fie fie fie pah pah Give me an ounce of civet good apothecary to sweeten my imagination there's money for thee

O let me kiss that hand

let me wipe it first it smells of mortality

O ruin'd piece of nature This great world
shall so wear out to nought Dost thou know me

I remember thine eyes well enough
dost thou squiny at me No do thy worst blind Cupid I'll not love Read thou this challenge mark but the penning of it


I would not take this from report it is
and my heart breaks at it

read

what with the case of eyes

O ho are you there with me No eyes in your head nor no money in your purse Your eyes are in a heavy case your purse in a light yet you see how this world goes

I see it feelingly

what art mad A man may see how this world goes with no eyes Look with thine ears see how yound justice rails upon yon simple thief Hark in thine ear change places and handy-dandy which is the justice which is the thief Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar

ay sir

and the creature run from the cur There thou mightst behold the great image of authority a dog's obey'd in office
thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
why dost thou lash that whore Strip thine own back
for which thou whipp'st her The usurer hangs the cozener
through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear
robes and furr'd gowns hide all Plate sin with gold
and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks
arm it in rags a pigmy's straw doth pierce it
none does offend none I say none I'll able em
take that of me my friend who have the power
to seal the accuser's lips Get thee glass eyes
and like a scurvy politician seem
to see the things thou dost not Now now now now
pull off my boots harder harder so

O matter and impertinency mix'd
reason in madness

if thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes
I know thee well enough thy name is Gloucester
thou must be patient we came crying hither
thou know'st the first time that we smell the air

alack alack the day

when we are born we cry that we are come
to this great stage of fools This' a good block
it were a delicate stratagem to shoe
a troop of horse with felt I'll put it in proof
and when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law
then kill kill kill kill kill kill


O here he is lay hand upon him Sir
your most dear daughter

no rescue What a prisoner I am even
the natural fool of fortune Use me well
you shall have ransom Let me have surgeons
I am cut to the brains


no seconds All myself

to use his eyes for garden water-pots
ay and laying autumn's dust

I will be jovial come come I am a king
my masters know you that

slave thou hast slain me Villain take my purse
if ever thou wilt thrive bury my body
and give the letters which thou find'st about me
to Edmund Earl of Gloucester seek him out
upon the English party O untimely death


I know thee well a serviceable villain
as duteous to the vices of thy mistress
as badness would desire
what is he dead

sit you down father rest you
let's see his pockets these letters that he speaks of
may be my friends He's dead I am only sorry
he had no other deaths-man Let us see
leave gentle wax and manners blame us not
to know our enemies' minds we'd rip their hearts
their papers is more lawful
let our reciprocal vows be remembered You have many opportunities to cut him off if your will want not time and place will be fruitfully offered There is nothing done if he return the conqueror then am I the prisoner and his bed my gaol from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me and supply the place for your labour
your wife so I would say
affectionate servant
O undistinguish'd space of woman's will
a plot upon her virtuous husband's life
and the exchange my brother Here in the sands
thee I'll rake up the post unsanctified
of murderous lechers and in the mature time
with this ungracious paper strike the sight
of the death-practis'd duke For him tis well

the king is mad how stiff is my vile sense
that I stand up and have ingenious feeling
of my huge sorrows Better I were distract
so should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs
and woes by wrong imaginations lose
the knowledge of themselves


give me your hand
far off methinks I hear the beaten drum
come father I'll bestow you with a friend


O thou good Kent how shall I live and work
to match thy goodness My life will be too short
and every measure fail me

to be acknowledg'd madam is o'erpaid
nor more nor clipp'd but so

be better suited
these weeds are memories of those worser hours
I prithee put them off

pardon me dear madam
yet to be known shortens my made intent
my boon I make it that you know me not
till time and I think meet

then be t so my good lord

how does the king

madam sleeps still

O you kind gods
cure this great breach in his abused nature
of this child-changed father

so please your majesty
that we may wake the king he hath slept long

be govern'd by your knowledge and proceed
i' the sway of your own will Is he array'd


ay madam in the heaviness of sleep
we put fresh garments on him

be by good madam when we do awake him
I doubt not of his temperance

very well


please you draw near Louder the music there
O my dear father Restoration hang
thy medicine on my lips and let this kiss
repair those violent harms that my two sisters
have in thy reverence made

kind and dear princess

had you not been their father these white flakes
had challeng'd pity of them Was this a face
to be expos'd against the warring winds
to stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder
in the most terrible and nimble stroke
of quick cross lightning to watch poor perdu
with this thin helm Mine enemy's dog
though he had bit me should have stood that night
against my fire And wast thou fain poor father
to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
in short and musty straw Alack alack
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once

madam do you tis fittest

how does my royal lord How fares your majesty

you do me wrong to take me out o' the grave
thou art a soul in bliss but I am bound
upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead

sir do you know me

you are a spirit I know when did you die

still still far wide

he's scarce awake let him alone awhile

where have I been Where am I Fair day-light
to see another thus I know not what to say
I will not swear these are my hands let's see
I feel this pin prick Would I were assur'd
of my condition

O look upon me sir
and hold your hands in benediction o'er me
no sir you must not kneel

pray do not mock me
I am a very foolish fond old man
fourscore and upward not an hour more or less
and to deal plainly
I fear I am not in my perfect mind
methinks I should know you and know this man
yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
what place this is and all the skill I have
remembers not these garments nor I know not
where I did lodge last night Do not laugh at me
to be my child Cordelia

and so I am I am

be your tears wet Yes faith I pray weep not
if you have poison for me I will drink it
I know you do not love me for your sisters
have as I do remember done me wrong
you have some cause they have not

no cause no cause

am I in France

in your own kingdom sir

do not abuse me

be comforted good madam the great rage
to make him even o'er the time he has lost
desire him to go in trouble him no more
till further settling

will t please your highness walk

you must bear with me
pray you now forget and forgive I am old and foolish


holds it true sir that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain

most certain sir

who is conductor of his people

as tis said the bastard son of Gloucester

they say Edgar his banished son is with the Earl of Kent in Germany
report is changeable Tis time to look about the powers of the kingdom approach apace

the arbitrement is like to be bloody
fare you well sir


my point and period will be throughly wrought
or well or ill as this day's battle's fought

know of the duke if his last purpose hold
or whether since he is advis'd by aught
to change the course he's full of alteration
and self-reproving bring his constant pleasure


our sister's man is certainly miscarried

'Tis to be doubted madam

you know the goodness I intend upon you
tell me but truly but then speak the truth
do you not love my sister

in honour'd love

but have you never found my brother's way
to the forefended place

that thought abuses you

I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
and bosom'd with her as far as we call hers

no by mine honour madam

I never shall endure her dear my lord
be not familiar with her

she and the duke her husband


I had rather lose the battle than that sister
should loosen him and me

our very loving sister well be-met
sir this I heard the king is come to his daughter
with others whom the rigour of our state
forc'd to cry out Where I could not be honest
I never yet was valiant for this business
it toucheth us as France invades our land
not bolds the king with others whom I fear
most just and heavy causes make oppose

sir you speak nobly

why is this reason'd

for these domestic and particular broils
are not the question here

let's then determine
with the ancient of war on our proceeding

I shall attend you presently at your tent

sister you'll go with us

no

'Tis most convenient pray you go with us

O ho I know the riddle [Aloud ] I will go


if e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor
hear me one word
I'll overtake you Speak


before you fight the battle ope this letter
if you have victory let the trumpet sound
for him that brought it wretched though I seem
I can produce a champion that will prove
what is avouched there If you miscarry
your business of the world hath so an end
and machination ceases Fortune love you

stay till I have read the letter

I was forbid it
when time shall serve let but the herald cry
and I'll appear again

why fare thee well I will o'erlook thy paper

here is the guess of their true strength and forces
by diligent discovery but your haste
is now urg'd on you

we will greet the time


to both these sisters have I sworn my love
each jealous of the other as the stung
are of the adder Which of them shall I take
both one or neither Neither can be enjoy'd
if both remain alive to take the widow
exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril
and hardly shall I carry out my side
her husband being alive Now then we'll use
his countenance for the battle which being done
let her who would be rid of him devise
his speedy taking off As for the mercy
which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia
shall never see his pardon for my state
stands on me to defend not to debate

here father take the shadow of this tree
for your good host pray that the right may thrive
if ever I return to you again
I'll bring you comfort

Grace go with you sir

away old man give me thy hand away
king Lear hath lost he and his daughter ta'en
give me thy hand come on

no further sir a man may rot even here

what in ill thoughts again Men must endure
their going hence even as their coming hither
ripeness is all Come on
and that's true too

some officers take them away good guard
until their greater pleasures first be known
that are to censure them

we are not the first
who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst
for thee oppressed king am I cast down
myself could else out-frown false Fortune's frown
shall we not see these daughters and these sisters

no no no no Come let's away to prison
we two alone will sing like birds i' the cage
when thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down
and ask of thee forgiveness so we'll live
and pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh
at gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues
talk of court news and we'll talk with them too
and take upon's the mystery of things
as if we were God's spies and we'll wear out
in a wall'd prison packs and sets of great ones
that ebb and flow by the moon

take them away

upon such sacrifices my Cordelia
the gods themselves throw incense Have I caught thee
he that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
and fire us hence like foxes Wipe thine eyes
the goujeres shall devour them flesh and fell
ere they shall make us weep we'll see em starve first
come


come hither captain hark
take thou this note

one step I have advanc'd thee if thou dost
as this instructs thee thou dost make thy way
to noble fortunes know thou this that men
are as the time is to be tender-minded
does not become a sword thy great employment
will not bear question either say thou'lt do't
or thrive by other means

I'll do't my lord

about it and write happy when thou hast done
mark I say instantly and carry it so
as I have set it down

I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats
if it be man's work I will do it

sir you have show'd to-day your valiant strain
and fortune led you well you have the captives
we do require them of you so to use them
as we shall find their merits and our safety
may equally determine

sir I thought it fit
to send the old and miserable king
to some retention and appointed guard
whose age has charms in it whose title more
to pluck the common bosom on his side
and turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
which do command them With him I sent the queen
my reason all the same and they are ready
to-morrow or at further space to appear
where you shall hold your session At this time
we sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
and the best quarrels in the heat are curs'd
by those that feel their sharpness
the question of Cordelia and her father
requires a fitter place
sir by your patience
I hold you but a subject of this war
not as a brother

that's as we list to grace him
methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
ere you had spoke so far He led our powers
bore the commission of my place and person
the which immediacy may well stand up
and call itself your brother

not so hot
in his own grace he doth exalt himself
more than in your addition

in my rights
by me invested he compeers the best

that were the most if he should husband you
jesters do oft prove prophets

holla holla
that eye that told you so look'd but a-squint

lady I am not well else I should answer
from a full-flowing stomach General
take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony
dispose of them of me the walls are thine
witness the world that I create thee here
my lord and master

mean you to enjoy him

the let-alone lies not in your good will

nor in thine lord

half-blooded fellow yes
let the drum strike and prove my title thine

stay yet hear reason Edmund I arrest thee
on capital treason and in thy arrest
this gilded serpent

for your claim fair sister
I bar it in the interest of my wife
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord
and I her husband contradict your bans
if you will marry make your love to me
my lady is bespoke

an interlude

thou art arm'd Gloucester let the trumpet sound
if none appear to prove upon thy person
thy heinous manifest and many treasons
there is my pledge
I'll prove it on thy heart
ere I taste bread thou art in nothing less
than I have here proclaim'd thee

sick O sick

if not I'll ne'er trust medicine

there's my exchange

what in the world he is
that names me traitor villain-like be lies
call by thy trumpet he that dares approach
on him on you who not I will maintain
my truth and honour firmly

a herald ho

a herald ho a herald
trust to thy single virtue for thy soldiers
all levied in my name have in my name
took their discharge

my sickness grows upon me

she is not well convey her to my tent

come hither herald


let the trumpet sound

and read out this

sound trumpet


if any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund supposed Earl of Gloucester that he is a manifold traitor let him appear at the third sound of the trumpet He is bold in his defence
sound


again


again


ask him his purposes why he appears
upon this call o' the trumpet

what are you
your name your quality and why you answer
this present summons

know my name is lost
by treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit
yet am I noble as the adversary

which is that adversary

what's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester

himself what sayst thou to him

draw thy sword
that if my speech offend a noble heart
thy arm may do thee justice here is mine
behold it is the privilege of mine honours
my oath and my profession I protest
maugre thy strength youth place and eminence
despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune
thy valour and thy heart thou art a traitor
false to thy gods thy brother and thy father
conspirant gainst this high illustrious prince
and from the extremest upward of thy head
to the descent and dust below thy foot
this sword this arm and my best spirits are bent
to prove upon thy heart whereto I speak
thou liest

in wisdom I should ask thy name
but since thy outside looks so fair and war-like
and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes
what safe and nicely I might well delay
by rule of knighthood I disdain and spurn
back do I toss these treasons to thy head
with the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart
which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise
this sword of mine shall give them instant way
where they shall rest for ever Trumpets speak


save him save him

this is practice Gloucester
an unknown opposite thou art not vanquish'd
but cozen'd and beguil'd

shut your mouth dame
or with this paper shall I stop it Hold sir
thou worse than any name read thine own evil
no tearing lady I perceive you know it


say if I do the laws are mine not thine
who can arraign me for t


most monstrous
know'st thou this paper

ask me not what I know

go after her she's desperate govern her

what you have charg'd me with that have I done
and more much more the time will bring it out
'Tis past and so am I But what art thou
that hast this fortune on me If thou'rt noble
I do forgive thee

let's exchange charity
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund
if more the more thou hast wrong'd me
my name is Edgar and thy father's son
the gods are just and of our pleasant vices
make instruments to plague us
the dark and vicious place where thee he got
cost him his eyes

thou hast spoken right tis true
the wheel is come full circle I am here

a royal nobleness I must embrace thee
let sorrow split my heart if ever I
did hate thee or thy father

worthy prince I know t

where have you hid yourself
how have you known the miseries of your father

by nursing them my lord List a brief tale
and when tis told O that my heart would burst
the bloody proclamation to escape
that follow'd me so near O our lives' sweetness
that we the pain of death would hourly die
rather than die at once taught me to shift
into a madman's rags to assume a semblance
that very dogs disdain'd and in this habit
met I my father with his bleeding rings
their precious stones new lost became his guide
never O fault reveal'd myself unto him
until some half hour past when I was arm'd
not sure though hoping of this good success
I ask'd his blessing and from first to last
told him my pilgrimage but his flaw'd heart
alack too weak the conflict to support
'Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
burst smilingly

this speech of yours hath mov'd me
and shall perchance do good but speak you on
you look as you had something more to say

if there be more more woeful hold it in
for I am almost ready to dissolve
hearing of this

this would have seem'd a period
to such as love not sorrow but another
and top extremity
whilst I was big in clamour came there a man
who having seen me in my worst estate
shunn'd my abhorr'd society but then finding
who twas that so endur'd with his strong arms
he fasten'd on my neck and bellow'd out
as he'd burst heaven threw him on my father
told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
that ever ear receiv'd which in recounting
his grief grew puissant and the strings of life
began to crack twice then the trumpet sounded
and there I left him tranc'd

but who was this

Kent sir the banish'd Kent who in disguise
follow'd his enemy king and did him service
improper for a slave

help help O help

what kind of help

speak man

what means that bloody knife

'Tis hot it smokes
it came even from the heart of O she's dead

who dead speak man

your lady sir your lady and her sister
by her is poison'd she confesses it

I was contracted to them both all three
now marry in an instant


produce the bodies be they alive or dead
this judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble
touches us not with pity

O is this he
the time will not allow the compliment

which very manners urges

I am come
to bid my king and master aye good-night
is he not here

great thing of us forgot
speak Edmund where's the king and where's Cordelia
seest thou this object Kent



yet Edmund was belov'd
the one the other poison'd for my sake
and after slew herself

even so Cover their faces

I pant for life some good I mean to do
despite of mine own nature Quickly send
be brief in it to the castle for my writ
is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia
nay send in time

run run O run

to whom my lord Who has the office send
thy token of reprieve

well thought on take my sword

haste thee for thy life


he hath commission from my wife and me
to hang Cordelia in the prison and
to lay the blame upon her own despair
that she fordid herself

the gods defend her Bear him hence awhile

howl howl howl howl O you are men of stones
had I your tongues and eyes I'd use them so
that heaven's vaults should crack She's gone for ever
I know when one is dead and when one lives
she's dead as earth Lend me a looking-glass
if that her breath will mist or stain the stone
why then she lives


or image of that horror

fall and cease

this feather stirs she lives if it be so
it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
that ever I have felt

O my good master

prithee away

'Tis noble Kent your friend

a plague upon you murderers traitors all
I might have sav'd her now she's gone for ever
Cordelia Cordelia stay a little Ha
what is t thou sayst Her voice was ever soft
I kill'd the slave that was a hanging thee

'Tis true my lord he did

did I not fellow
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip I am old now
and these same crosses spoil me Who are you
mine eyes are not o' the best I'll tell you straight

if fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated
one of them we behold

this is a dull sight Are you not Kent

the same
your servant Kent Where is your servant Caius

he's a good fellow I can tell you that

no my good lord I am the very man

I'll see that straight

that from your first of difference and decay
have follow'd your sad steps

you are welcome hither

nor no man else all's cheerless dark and deadly
your eldest daughters have fordone themselves
and desperately are dead

ay so I think

he knows not what he says and vain it is
that we present us to him



Edmund is dead my lord

that's but a trifle here
you lords and noble friends know our intent
what comfort to this great decay may come
shall be applied for us we will resign
during the life of this old majesty
to him our absolute power

you to your rights
with boot and such addition as your honours
have more than merited All friends shall taste
the wages of their virtue and all foes
the cup of their deservings O see see

and my poor fool is hang'd No no no life
why should a dog a horse a rat have life
never never never never never
pray you undo this button thank you sir
do you see this Look on her look her lips
look there look there


he faints my lord my lord

break heart I prithee break

look up my lord

vex not his ghost O let him pass he hates him
that would upon the rack of this tough world
stretch him out longer

he is gone indeed

the wonder is he hath endur'd so long

bear them from hence Our present business
is general woe

friends of my soul you twain
rule in this realm and the gor'd state sustain

I have a journey sir shortly to go
my master calls me I must not say no

the weight of this sad time we must obey
speak what we feel not what we ought to say
the oldest hath borne most we that are young
shall never see so much nor live so long

MACBETH

when shall we three meet again
in thunder lightning or in rain
when the hurlyburly's done
when the battle's lost and won

that will be ere the set of sun

where the place

upon the heath

there to meet with Macbeth

I come Graymalkin

paddock calls

anon

fair is foul and foul is fair
hover through the fog and filthy air
what bloody man is that He can report
as seemeth by his plight of the revolt
the newest state

this is the sergeant
who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity Hail brave friend
say to the king the knowledge of the broil
as thou didst leave it

doubtful it stood
as two spent swimmers that do cling together
and choke their art The merciless Macdonwald
worthy to be a rebel for to that
the multiplying villanies of nature
do swarm upon him from the western isles
of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
show'd like a rebel's whore but all's too weak
disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel
which smok'd with bloody execution
like valour's minion carv'd out his passage
till he fac'd the slave
which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him
till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps
and fix'd his head upon our battlements

O valiant cousin worthy gentleman

as whence the sun gins his reflection
shipwracking storms and direful thunders break
so from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
discomfort swells Mark King of Scotland mark
no sooner justice had with valour arm'd
compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels
but the Norweyan lord surveying vantage
with furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
began a fresh assault
dismay'd not this
our captains Macbeth and Banquo

yes
as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
if I say sooth I must report they were
as cannons overcharg'd with double cracks
so they
doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
or memorize another Golgotha
I cannot tell
but I am faint my gashes cry for help

so well thy words become thee as thy wounds
they smack of honour both Go get him surgeons


who comes here
the worthy Thane of Ross

what a haste looks through his eyes So should he look
that seems to speak things strange

God save the king

whence cam'st thou worthy thane

from Fife great king
where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
and fan our people cold Norway himself
with terrible numbers
assisted by that most disloyal traitor
the Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict
till that Bellona's bridegroom lapp'd in proof
confronted him with self-comparisons
point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude

great happiness

that now
sweno the Norways' king craves composition
nor would we deign him burial of his men
till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch
ten thousand dollars to our general use

no more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
our bosom interest Go pronounce his present death
and with his former title greet Macbeth

I'll see it done

what he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won


where hast thou been sister
killing swine

sister where thou

a sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap
and munch'd and munch'd and munch'd Give me quoth I
'Aroint thee witch the rump-fed ronyon cries
her husband's to Aleppo gone master o' the Tiger
but in a sieve I'll thither sail
and like a rat without a tail
I'll do I'll do and I'll do

I'll give thee a wind

thou'rt kind

and I another

I myself have all the other
all the quarters that they know
i' the shipman's card
I'll drain him dry as hay
sleep shall neither night nor day
hang upon his pent-house lid
he shall live a man forbid
weary se'nnights nine times nine
shall he dwindle peak and pine
though his bark cannot be lost
yet it shall be tempest-tost
look what I have

show me show me

here I have a pilot's thumb
wrack'd as homeward he did come


a drum a drum

the weird sisters hand in hand
posters of the sea and land
thus do go about about
thrice to thine and thrice to mine
and thrice again to make up nine
peace the charm's wound up


so foul and fair a day I have not seen

how far is t call'd to Forres What are these
so wither'd and so wild in their attire
that look not like th' inhabitants o' the earth
and yet are on t Live you or are you aught
that man may question You seem to understand me
by each at once her choppy finger laying
upon her skinny lips you should be women
and yet your beards forbid me to interpret

speak if you can what are you

all hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Glamis

all hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Cawdor

all hail Macbeth that shalt be king hereafter

good sir why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair I' the name of truth
are ye fantastical or that indeed
which outwardly ye show My noble partner
you greet with present grace and great prediction
of noble having and of royal hope
that he seems rapt withal to me you speak not
if you can look into the seeds of time
and say which grain will grow and which will not
speak then to me who neither beg nor fear

hail

hail

hail

lesser than Macbeth and greater

not so happy yet much happier

thou shalt get kings though thou be none
so all hail Macbeth and Banquo

Banquo and Macbeth all hail

stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
by Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis
but how of Cawdor the Thane of Cawdor lives
stands not within the prospect of belief
no more than to be Cawdor Say from whence
you owe this strange intelligence or why
upon this blasted heath you stop our way
with such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you


the earth hath bubbles as the water has
and these are of them Whither are they vanish'd

into the air and what seem'd corporal melted
as breath into the wind Would they had stay'd

were such things here as we do speak about
or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner

your children shall be kings


and Thane of Cawdor too went it not so

to the self-same tune and words Who's here


the king hath happily receiv'd Macbeth
the news of thy success and when he reads
thy personal venture in the rebels' fight
his wonders and his praises do contend
which should be thine or his Silenc'd with that
in viewing o'er the rest o' the self-same day
he finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks
nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
strange images of death As thick as hail
came post with post and every one did bear
thy praises in his kingdom's great defence
and pour'd them down before him

to give thee from our royal master thanks
only to herald thee into his sight
not pay thee

and for an earnest of a greater honour
he bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor
in which addition hail most worthy thane
for it is thine

what can the devil speak true

the Thane of Cawdor lives why do you dress me
in borrow'd robes

who was the thane lives yet
but under heavy judgment bears that life
which he deserves to lose Whether he was combin'd
with those of Norway or did line the rebel
with hidden help or vantage or that with both
but treasons capital confess'd and prov'd
have overthrown him

Glamis and Thane of Cawdor
the greatest is behind

thanks for your pains


do you not hope your children shall be kings
when those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
promis'd no less to them

that trusted home
might yet enkindle you unto the crown
besides the Thane of Cawdor But tis strange
and oftentimes to win us to our harm
the instruments of darkness tell us truths
win us with honest trifles to betray's
cousins a word I pray you

two truths are told
as happy prologues to the swelling act
of the imperial theme I thank you gentlemen


this supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill cannot be good if ill
why hath it given me earnest of success
commencing in a truth I am Thane of Cawdor
if good why do I yield to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
against the use of nature Present fears
are less than horrible imaginings
my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
shakes so my single state of man that function
is smother'd in surmise and nothing is

look how our partner's rapt

if chance will have me king why chance may crown me
without my stir

new honours come upon him
like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
but with the aid of use

come what come may
time and the hour runs through the roughest day

worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure

give me your favour my dull brain was wrought
with things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains
are register'd where every day I turn
the leaf to read them Let us toward the king
the interim having weigh'd it let us speak
our free hearts each to other

very gladly

till then enough Come friends


is execution done on Cawdor Are not
those in commission yet return'd

my liege
they are not yet come back but I have spoke
with one that saw him die who did report
that very frankly he confess'd his treasons
implor'd your highness' pardon and set forth
a deep repentance Nothing in his life
became him like the leaving it he died
as one that had been studied in his death
as twere a careless trifle

there's no art
to find the mind's construction in the face
he was a gentleman on whom I built
an absolute trust


O worthiest cousin
the sin of my ingratitude even now
was heavy on me Thou art so far before
that swiftest wing of recompense is slow
to overtake thee would thou hadst less deserv'd
that the proportion both of thanks and payment
might have been mine only I have left to say

more is thy due than more than all can pay

the service and the loyalty I owe
is to receive our duties and our duties
are to your throne and state children and servants
which do but what they should by doing everything
safe toward your love and honour

welcome hither
I have begun to plant thee and will labour
to make thee full of growing Noble Banquo
that hast no less deserv'd nor must be known
no less to have done so let me infold thee
and hold thee to my heart

there if I grow
the harvest is your own

my plenteous joys
wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes
and you whose places are the nearest know
our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter
the Prince of Cumberland which honour must
not unaccompanied invest him only
but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
on all deservers From hence to Inverness
and bind us further to you

the rest is labour which is not us'd for you
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
the hearing of my wife with your approach
so humbly take my leave

my worthy Cawdor

the Prince of Cumberland that is a step
on which I must fall down or else o'er-leap
for in my way it lies Stars hide your fires
let not light see my black and deep desires
the eye wink at the hand yet let that be


true worthy Banquo he is full so valiant
and in his commendations I am fed
it is a banquet to me Let's after him
whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
it is a peerless kinsman

they met me in the day of success and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge When I burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king who all-hailed me Thane of Cawdor by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with Hail king that shall be This have I thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou mightest not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy heart and farewell
Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be
what thou art promis'd Yet do I fear thy nature
it is too full o' the milk of human kindness
to catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great
art not without ambition but without
the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly
that thou wouldst holily wouldst not play false
and yet wouldst wrongly win thou'dst have great Glamis
that which cries Thus thou must do if thou have it
and that which rather thou dost fear to do
that I may pour my spirits in thine ear
and chastise with the valour of my tongue
all that impedes thee from the golden round
which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
to have thee crown'd withal

what is your tidings

the king comes here to-night

thou'rt mad to say it
is not thy master with him who were't so
would have inform'd for preparation

so please you it is true our thane is coming
one of my fellows had the speed of him
who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
than would make up his message

he brings great news

the raven himself is hoarse
that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
under my battlements Come you spirits
that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
and fill me from the crown to the toe top full
of direst cruelty make thick my blood
stop up the access and passage to remorse
that no compunctious visitings of nature
shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
the effect and it Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall you murdering ministers
wherever in your sightless substances
you wait on nature's mischief Come thick night
and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
that my keen knife see not the wound it makes
nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
to cry Hold hold

great Glamis worthy Cawdor
greater than both by the all-hail hereafter
thy letters have transported me beyond
this ignorant present and I feel now

the future in the instant

my dearest love
Duncan comes here to-night

and when goes hence

to-morrow as he purposes

O never
shall sun that morrow see
your face my thane is as a book where men
may read strange matters To beguile the time
your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
but be the serpent under't He that's coming
must be provided for and you shall put
this night's great business into my dispatch
which shall to all our nights and days to come
give solely sovereign sway and masterdom

we will speak further

only look up clear
to alter favour ever is to fear
leave all the rest to me

this castle hath a pleasant seat the air
nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
unto our gentle senses

this guest of summer
the temple-haunting martlet does approve
smells wooingly here no jutty frieze
buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird
hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle
where they most breed and haunt I have observ'd
the air is delicate


see see our honour'd hostess
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble
which still we thank as love Herein I teach you
how you shall bid God eyld us for your pains
and thank us for your trouble

all our service
in every point twice done and then done double
were poor and single business to contend
against those honours deep and broad wherewith
your majesty loads our house for those of old
and the late dignities heap'd up to them

where's the Thane of Cawdor
we cours'd him at the heels and had a purpose
to be his purveyor but he rides well
and his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him
to his home before us Fair and noble hostess
we are your guest to-night

your servants ever
have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt
to make their audit at your highness' pleasure
still to return your own

give me your hand
conduct me to mine host we love him highly
and shall continue our graces towards him
by your leave hostess

if it were done when tis done then twere well
could trammel up the consequence and catch
with his surcease success that but this blow
might be the be-all and the end-all here
but here upon this bank and shoal of time
we'd jump the life to come But in these cases
we still have judgment here that we but teach
bloody instructions which being taught return
to plague the inventor this even-handed justice
commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
to our own lips He's here in double trust
first as I am his kinsman and his subject
strong both against the deed then as his host
who should against his murderer shut the door
not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan
hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
so clear in his great office that his virtues
will plead like angels trumpet-tongu'd against
the deep damnation of his taking-off
and pity like a naked new-born babe
upon the sightless couriers of the air
shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
that tears shall drown the wind I have no spur
to prick the sides of my intent but only
vaulting ambition which o'er-leaps itself
and falls on the other

how now what news

he has almost supp'd why have you left the chamber

hath he ask'd for me

know you not he has

we will proceed no further in this business
he hath honour'd me of late and I have bought
golden opinions from all sorts of people
which would be worn now in their newest gloss

was the hope drunk
wherein you dress'd yourself hath it slept since
and wakes it now to look so green and pale
at what it did so freely From this time
such I account thy love Art thou afeard
to be the same in thine own act and valour
as thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
which thou esteem'st the ornament of life
and live a coward in thine own esteem
letting I dare not' wait upon I would
like the poor cat i' the adage

prithee peace
I dare do all that may become a man
who dares do more is none

what beast was't then
that made you break this enterprise to me
and to be more than what you were you would
be so much more the man Nor time nor place
did then adhere and yet you would make both
they have made themselves and that their fitness now
does unmake you I have given suck and know
how tender tis to love the babe that milks me
I would while it was smiling in my face
have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums
and dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you
have done to this

if we should fail

we fail
but screw your courage to the sticking-place
and we'll not fail When Duncan is asleep
whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
soundly invite him his two chamberlains
will I with wine and wassail so convince
shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
a limbeck only when in swinish sleep
their drenched natures lie as in a death
what cannot you and I perform upon
the unguarded Duncan what not put upon
his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell

bring forth men-children only
for thy undaunted mettle should compose
nothing but males Will it not be receiv'd
when we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
of his own chamber and us'd their very daggers
that they have done't

who dares receive it other
as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
upon his death

each corporal agent to this terrible feat
away and mock the time with fairest show
false face must hide what the false heart doth know

how goes the night boy

the moon is down I have not heard the clock

and she goes down at twelve

I take't tis later sir

hold take my sword There's husbandry in heaven
their candles are all out Take thee that too
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me
and yet I would not sleep merciful powers
restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
gives way to in repose

give me my sword

who's there

a friend

what sir not yet at rest The king's a-bed
he hath been in unusual pleasure and
sent forth great largess to your offices
this diamond he greets your wife withal
by the name of most kind hostess and shut up
in measureless content

being unprepar'd
our will became the servant to defect
which else should free have wrought

all's well
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters

I think not of them
yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
we would spend it in some words upon that business
if you would grant the time

at your kind'st leisure

if you shall cleave to my consent when tis
it shall make honour for you

so I lose none
in seeking to augment it but still keep
my bosom franchis'd and allegiance clear
I shall be counsell'd

good repose the while

thanks sir the like to you

go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
she strike upon the bell Get thee to bed

is this a dagger which I see before me
the handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee
I have thee not and yet I see thee still
art thou not fatal vision sensible
to feeling as to sight or art thou but
a dagger of the mind a false creation
proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain
I see thee yet in form as palpable
as this which now I draw
thou marshall'st me the way that I was going
and such an instrument I was to use
mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses
or else worth all the rest I see thee still
and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
which was not so before There's no such thing
thus to mine eyes Now o'er the one half-world
nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
the curtain'd sleep witchcraft celebrates
pale Hecate's offerings and wither'd murder
alarum'd by his sentinel the wolf
whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace
with Tarquin's ravishing strides toward his design
moves like a ghost Thou sure and firm-set earth
hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
thy very stones prate of my whereabout
and take the present horror from the time
which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives
words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives

I go and it is done the bell invites me
hear it not Duncan for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven or to hell


what hath quench'd them hath given me fire Hark
peace
it was the owl that shriek'd the fatal bellman
which gives the stern'st good-night He is about it
the doors are open and the surfeited grooms
do mock their charge with snores I have drugg'd their possets
that death and nature do contend about them
whether they live or die

who's there what ho

alack I am afraid they have awak'd
and tis not done the attempt and not the deed
confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready
he could not miss them Had he not resembled
my father as he slept I had done t My husband


I have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
did not you speak

when

now

as I descended

ay

hark
who lies i' the second chamber

Donalbain

this is a sorry sight

a foolish thought to say a sorry sight
there's one did laugh in s sleep and one cried Murder
that they did wake each other I stood and heard them
but they did say their prayers and address'd them
again to sleep

there are two lodg'd together

one cried God bless us and Amen' the other
as they had seen me with these hangman's hands
listening their fear I could not say Amen
when they did say God bless us

consider it not so deeply

but wherefore could not I pronounce Amen
I had most need of blessing and Amen'
stuck in my throat

these deeds must not be thought

methought I heard a voice cry Sleep no more
Macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep
sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care
the death of each day's life sore labour's bath
balm of hurt minds great nature's second course
chief nourisher in life's feast

what do you mean

still it cried Sleep no more to all the house
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep and therefore Cawdor
shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more

who was it that thus cried Why worthy thane
you do unbend your noble strength to think
so brainsickly of things Go get some water
and wash this filthy witness from your hand
why did you bring these daggers from the place
the sleepy grooms with blood

I'll go no more
I am afraid to think what I have done
look on t again I dare not

infirm of purpose
give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead
are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood
that fears a painted devil If he do bleed
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal
for it must seem their guilt


whence is that knocking
how is't with me when every noise appals me
what hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes
will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
clean from my hand No this my hand will rather
making the green one red


my hands are of your colour but I shame
to wear a heart so white

I hear a knocking
at the south entry retire we to our chamber
a little water clears us of this deed
how easy is it then Your constancy
hath left you unattended

hark more knocking
get on your night-gown lest occasion call us
and show us to be watchers Be not lost
so poorly in your thoughts

to know my deed twere best not know myself



here's a knocking indeed If a man were porter of hell-gate he should have old turning the key

knock knock knock Who's there i' the name of Beelzebub Here's a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty come in time have napkins enough about you here you'll sweat for t [Knocking within ] Knock knock Who's there i' the other devil's name Faith here's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale who committed treason enough for God's sake yet could not equivocate to heaven O come in equivocator [Knocking within ] Knock knock knock Who's there Faith here's an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose come in tailor here you may roast your goose [Knocking within ] Knock knock never at quiet What are you But this place is too cold for hell I'll devil-porter it no further I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire [Knocking within ] Anon anon I pray you remember the porter

was it so late friend ere you went to bed
that you do lie so late

faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and drink sir is a great provoker of three things

what three things does drink especially provoke

marry sir mose-painting sleep and urine Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes away the performance Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him

I believe drink gave thee the lie last night

that it did sir i' the very throat o' me but I requited him for his lie and I think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast him


our knocking has awak'd him here he comes

good morrow noble sir

good morrow both

is the king stirring worthy thane

not yet

he did command me to call timely on him
I have almost slipp'd the hour

I'll bring you to him

I know this is a joyful trouble to you
but yet tis one

this is the door

I'll make so bold to call
for tis my limited service


goes the king hence to-day

he does he did appoint so

the night has been unruly where we lay
ourchimneys were blown down and as they say
lamentings heard i' the air strange screams of death
and prophesying with accents terrible
of dire combustion and confus'd events
new hatch'd to the woeful time The obscure bird
clamour'd the livelong night some say the earth
was feverous and did shake


my young remembrance cannot parallel
a fellow to it


O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart
cannot conceive nor name thee

what's the matter

what's the matter

confusion now hath made his masterpiece
most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
the Lord's anointed temple and stole thence
the life o' the building

what is t you say the life


approach the chamber and destroy your sight
with a new Gorgon do not bid me speak
see and then speak yourselves

awake awake
ring the alarum-bell Murder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake
shake off this downy sleep death's counterfeit
and look on death itself up up and see
the great doom's image Malcolm Banquo
as from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
to countenance this horror Ring the bell

what's the business
that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
the sleepers of the house speak speak

O gentle lady
the repetition in a woman's ear
would murder as it fell


O Banquo Banquo

our royal master's murder'd

woe alas
what in our house

too cruel any where
dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself
and say it is not so


had I but died an hour before this chance
I had liv'd a blessed time for from this instant
there's nothing serious in mortality
the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
is left this vault to brag of


what is amiss

you are and do not know t
the spring the head the fountain of your blood
is stopp'd the very source of it is stopp'd

your royal father's murder'd

O by whom

those of his chamber as it seem'd had done t
their hands and faces were all badg'd with blood
so were their daggers which unwip'd we found
upon their pillows they star'd and were distracted no man's life
was to be trusted with them
O yet I do repent me of my fury
that I did kill them

wherefore did you so

who can be wise amaz'd temperate and furious
loyal and neutral in a moment No man
the expedition of my violent love
outran the pauser reason Here lay Duncan
his silver skin lac'd with his golden blood
and his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
for ruin's wasteful entrance there the murderers
steep'd in the colours of their trade their daggers
unmannerly breech'd with gore who could refrain
that had a heart to love and in that heart
courage to make s love known

help me hence ho


why do we hold our tongues
that most may claim this argument for ours

what should be spoken
here where our fate hid in an auger-hole
may rush and seize us Let's away our tears
are not yet brew'd

nor our strong sorrow
upon the foot of motion

look to the lady

and when we have our naked frailties hid
that suffer in exposure let us meet
and question this most bloody piece of work
to know it further Fears and scruples shake us
in the great hand of God I stand and thence
of treasonous malice

and so do I

so all

let's briefly put on manly readiness
and meet i' the hall together

well contented


what will you do Let's not consort with them
to show an unfelt sorrow is an office
which the false man does easy I'll to England

to Ireland I our separated fortune
shall keep us both the safer where we are
there's daggers in men's smiles the near in blood

this murderous shaft that's shot
hath not yet lighted and our safest way
is to avoid the aim therefore to horse
and let us not be dainty of leave-taking
but shift away there's warrant in that theft
which steals itself when there's no mercy left


threescore and ten I can remember well
within the volume of which time I have seen
hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
hath trifled former knowings

Ah good father
thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act
threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day
and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
is t night's predominance or the day's shame
when living light should kiss it

'Tis unnatural
even like the deed that's done On Tuesday last
a falcon towering in her pride of place
was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd

and Duncan's horses a thing most strange and certain
beauteous and swift the minions of their race
turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
contending gainst obedience as they would
make war with mankind

'Tis said they eat each other

they did so to the amazement of mine eyes
that look'd upon t Here comes the good Macduff

how goes the world sir now
why see you not

is t known who did this more than bloody deed

those that Macbeth hath slain

alas the day
what good could they pretend

they were suborn'd
Malcolm and Donalbain the king's two sons
are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed

'Gainst nature still
thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
thine own life's means Then tis most like
the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth

to be invested

where is Duncan's body

carried to Colmekill
the sacred storehouse of his predecessors
and guardian of their bones

will you to Scone

no cousin I'll to Fife

well I will thither

well may you see things well done there adieu
lest our old robes sit easier than our new

farewell father

that would make good of bad and friends of foes

thou hast it now King Cawdor Glamis all
as the weird women promis'd and I fear
thou play'dst most foully for t yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity
but that myself should be the root and father
of many kings If there come truth from them
as upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine
why by the verities on thee made good
may they not be my oracles as well
and set me up in hope But hush no more

here's our chief guest

if he had been forgotten
it had been as a gap in our great feast
and all-thing unbecoming

and I'll request your presence

let your highness
command upon me to the which my duties
are with a most indissoluble tie
for ever knit

ride you this afternoon

ay my good lord

we should have else desir'd your good advice
which still hath been both grave and prosperous
in this day's council but we'll take to-morrow
is t far you ride

as far my lord as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper go not my horse the better
I must become a borrower of the night

fail not our feast

my lord I will not

we hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd
in England and in Ireland not confessing
their cruel parricide filling their hearers
with strange invention but of that to-morrow
when therewithal we shall have cause of state
craving us jointly Hie you to horse adieu
till you return at night Goes Fleance with you

ay my good lord our time does call upon s

I wish your horses swift and sure of foot
and so I do commend you to their backs
farewell

till seven at night to make society
the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
till supper-time alone while then God be with you

sirrah a word with you Attend those men
our pleasure

they are my lord without the palace gate

bring them before us

to be thus is nothing
but to be safely thus Our fears in Banquo
stick deep and in his royalty of nature
reigns that which would be fear'd tis much he dares
and to that dauntless temper of his mind
he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
to act in safety There is none but he
whose being I do fear and under him
mark Antony's was by C sar He chid the sisters
when first they put the name of king upon me
and bade them speak to him then prophet-like
they hail'd him father to a line of kings
upon my head they plac'd a fruitless crown
and put a barren sceptre in my gripe
thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand
no son of mine succeeding If t be so
for Banquo's issue have I fil'd my mind
for them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd
put rancours in the vessel of my peace
only for them and mine eternal jewel
given to the common enemy of man
to make them kings the seed of Banquo kings
rather than so come fate into the list
and champion me to the utterance Who's there


now go to the door and stay there till we call

was it not yesterday we spoke together

it was so please your highness

well then now
have you consider'd of my speeches Know
that it was he in the times past which held you
so under fortune which you thought had been
our innocent self This I made good to you
in our last conference pass'd in probation with you
how you were borne in hand how cross'd the instruments
who wrought with them and all things else that might
to half a soul and to a notion craz'd
say Thus did Banquo

you made it known to us

I did so and went further which is now
your patience so predominant in your nature
that you can let this go Are you so gospell'd
to pray for this good man and for his issue
whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
and beggar'd yours for ever

we are men my liege

ay in the catalogue ye go for men
as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
shoughs water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept
all by the name of dogs the valu'd file
distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
the housekeeper the hunter every one
according to the gift which bounteous nature
hath in him clos'd whereby he does receive
particular addition from the bill
that writes them all alike and so of men
now if you have a station in the file
and I will put that business in your bosoms
whose execution takes your enemy off
grapples you to the heart and love of us
who wear our health but sickly in his life
which in his death were perfect

I am one my liege
whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
have so incens'd that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world

and I another
so weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune
that I would set my life on any chance
to mend it or be rid on t

both of you
know Banquo was your enemy


so is he mine and in such bloody distance
that every minute of his being thrusts
against my near'st of life and though I could
with bare-fac'd power sweep him from my sight
and bid my will avouch it yet I must not
for certain friends that are both his and mine
whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
whom I myself struck down and thence it is
that I to your assistance do make love
masking the business from the common eye
for sundry weighty reasons

we shall my lord
perform what you command us

though our lives

your spirits shine through you Within this hour at most
acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time
the moment on t for t must be done to-night
and something from the palace always thought
that I require a clearness and with him
to leave no rubs nor botches in the work
Fleance his son that keeps him company
whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father's must embrace the fate
of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart
I'll come to you anon

we are resolv'd my lord

I'll call upon you straight abide within

it is concluded Banquo thy soul's flight
if it find heaven must find it out to-night



ay madam but returns again to-night

say to the king I would attend his leisure
for a few words

madam I will


nought's had all's spent
where our desire is got without content
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy


how now my lord why do you keep alone
of sorriest fancies your companions making
using those thoughts which should indeed have died
with them they think on Things without all remedy
should be without regard what's done is done

we have scotch'd the snake not kill'd it
she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
remains in danger of her former tooth
but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer
ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
in the affliction of these terrible dreams
that shake us nightly Better be with the dead
whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
than on the torture of the mind to lie
in restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave
after life's fitful fever he sleeps well
treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
malice domestic foreign levy nothing
can touch him further

come on
gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks

so shall I love and so I pray be you
let your remembrance apply to Banquo
present him eminence both with eye and tongue
unsafe the while that we
must lave our honours in these flattering streams
and make our faces vizards to our hearts
disguising what they are

you must leave this

O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives

but in them nature's copy's not eterne

there's comfort yet they are assailable
then be thou jocund Ere the bat hath flown
his cloister'd flight ere to black Hecate's summons
hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done
a deed of dreadful note

what's to be done

be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
and with thy bloody and invisible hand
cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow
makes wing to the rooky wood
good things of day begin to droop and drowse
whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse
thou marvell'st at my words but hold thee still
things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
so prithee go with me



Macbeth

he needs not our mistrust since he delivers
our offices and what we have to do
to the direction just

then stand with us
the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day
now spurs the lated traveller apace
to gain the timely inn and near approaches
the subject of our watch

hark I hear horses

give us a light there ho

then tis he the rest
that are within the note of expectation

his horses go about

almost a mile but he does usually
so all men do from hence to the palace gate
make it their walk

a light a light

'Tis he

stand to t


it will be rain to-night

let it come down


thou mayst revenge O slave


who did strike out the light

was t not the way

there's but one down the son is fled

we have lost
best half of our affair

well let's away and say how much is done


you know your own degrees sit down at first and last
the hearty welcome

thanks to your majesty
ourself will mingle with society
and play the humble host
our hostess keeps her state but in best time
we will require her welcome

pronounce it for me sir to all our friends
for my heart speaks they are welcome


see they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks
both sides are even here I'll sit i' the midst
be large in mirth anon we'll drink a measure
the table round

there's blood upon thy face

'Tis Banquo's then

'Tis better thee without than he within

my lord his throat is cut that I did for him

thou art the best o' the cut-throats yet he's good
that did the like for Fleance if thou didst it
thou art the nonpareil

most royal sir
Fleance is scap'd

then comes my fit again I had else been perfect
whole as the marble founded as the rock
as broad and general as the casing air
but now I am cabin'd cribb'd confin'd bound in
to saucy doubts and fears But Banquo's safe

ay my good lord safe in a ditch he bides
with twenty trenched gashes on his head
the least a death to nature
thanks for that
there the grown serpent lies the worm that's fled
hath nature that in time will venom breed
no teeth for the present Get thee gone to-morrow
we'll hear ourselves again


my royal lord
you do not give the cheer the feast is sold
that is not often vouch'd while tis a-making
'Tis given with welcome to feed were best at home
from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony
meeting were bare without it

sweet remembrancer
now good digestion wait on appetite
and health on both

may it please your highness sit

here had we now our country's honour roof'd
were the grac'd person of our Banquo present
who may I rather challenge for unkindness
than pity for mischance

his absence sir
lays blame upon his promise Please t your highness
to grace us with your royal company

the table's full

here is a place reserv'd sir

where

here my good lord What is t that moves your highness

which of you have done this
what my good lord

thou canst not say I did it never shake
thy gory locks at me

gentlemen rise his highness is not well

sit worthy friends my lord is often thus
and hath been from his youth pray you keep seat
the fit is momentary upon a thought
he will again be well If much you note him
you shall offend him and extend his passion
feed and regard him not Are you a man

ay and a bold one that dare look on that
which might appal the devil

O proper stuff
this is the very painting of your fear
led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts
impostors to true fear would well become
a woman's story at a winter's fire
authoriz'd by her grandam Shame itself
why do you make such faces When all's done
you look but on a stool

prithee see there behold look lo how say you
why what care I If thou canst nod speak too
if charnel-houses and our graves must send
those that we bury back our monuments
shall be the maws of kites


what quite unmann'd in folly

if I stand here I saw him

fie for shame
blood hath been shed ere now i' the olden time
ere human statute purg'd the gentle weal
ay and since too murders have been perform'd
too terrible for the ear the times have been
that when the brains were out the man would die

and there an end but now they rise again
with twenty mortal murders on their crowns
and push us from our stools this is more strange
than such a murder is

my worthy lord
your noble friends do lack you

I do forget
do not muse at me my most worthy friends
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing
to those that know me Come love and health to all
then I'll sit down Give me some wine fill full
and to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
would he were here to all and him we thirst
and all to all

our duties and the pledge


avaunt and quit my sight Let the earth hide thee
thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
thou hast no speculation in those eyes
which thou dost glare with

think of this good peers
but as a thing of custom tis no other
only it spoils the pleasure of the time

what man dare I dare
approach thou like the rugged Russian bear
the arm'd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger
shall never tremble or be alive again
and dare me to the desart with thy sword
if trembling I inhabit then protest me
the baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow
unreal mockery hence

why so being gone
I am a man again Pray you sit still

you have displac'd the mirth broke the good meeting
with most admir'd disorder

can such things be
and overcome us like a summer's cloud
without our special wonder You make me strange
even to the disposition that I owe
when now I think you can behold such sights
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
when mine are blanch'd with fear
what sights my lord

I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
question enrages him At once good-night
stand not upon the order of your going
but go at once

good-night and better health
attend his majesty

a kind good-night to all


it will have blood they say blood will have blood
stones have been known to move and trees to speak
augurs and understood relations have
by maggot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
the secret'st man of blood What is the night


how sayst thou that Macduff denies his person
at our great bidding

did you send to him sir

I hear it by the way but I will send
there's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd I will to-morrow
and betimes I will to the weird sisters
more shall they speak for now I am bent to know
by the worst means the worst For mine own good
all causes shall give way I am in blood
stepp'd in so far that should I wade no more
returning were as tedious as go o'er
strange things I have in head that will to hand
which must be acted ere they may be scann'd

you lack the season of all natures sleep
come we'll to sleep My strange and self-abuse
is the initiate fear that wants hard use
we are yet but young in deed


why how now Hecate you look angerly

have I not reason beldams as you are
saucy and overbold How did you dare
to trade and traffic with Macbeth
in riddles and affairs of death
and I the mistress of your charms
the close contriver of all harms
was never call'd to bear my part
or show the glory of our art
and which is worse all you have done
hath been but for a wayward son
spiteful and wrathful who as others do
loves for his own ends not for you
and at the pit of Acheron
meet me i' the morning thither he
will come to know his destiny
your vessels and your spells provide
your charms and every thing beside
I am for the air this night I'll spend
unto a dismal and a fatal end
great business must be wrought ere noon
upon the corner of the moon
there hangs a vaporous drop profound
I'll catch it ere it come to ground
and that distill'd by magic sleights
shall raise such artificial sprites
as by the strength of their illusion
shall draw him on to his confusion
he shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
his hopes bove wisdom grace and fear
and you all know security
is mortals' chiefest enemy
hark I am call'd my little spirit see
sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me


come let's make haste she'll soon be back again


my former speeches have but hit your thoughts
which can interpret further only I say
things have been strangely borne The gracious Duncan
was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead
and the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late
whom you may say if t please you Fleance kill'd
for Fleance fled men must not walk too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrous
it was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
to kill their gracious father damned fact
how it did grieve Macbeth did he not straight
in pious rage the two delinquents tear
was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too
for twould have anger'd any heart alive
to hear the men deny t So that I say
he has borne all things well and I do think
that had he Duncan's sons under his key
as an t please heaven he shall not they should find
what twere to kill a father so should Fleance
but peace for from broad words and cause he fail'd
his presence at the tyrant's feast I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace Sir can you tell
where he bestows himself

the son of Duncan
from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
lives in the English court and is receiv'd
of the most pious Edward with such grace
that the malevolence of fortune nothing
takes from his high respect Thither Macduff
is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
that by the help of these with him above
to ratify the work we may again
give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
do faithful homage and receive free honours
all which we pine for now And this report
hath so exasperate the king that he
prepares for some attempt at war

sent he to Macduff

he did and with an absolute Sir not I
the cloudy messenger turns me his back
and hums as who should say You'll rue the time
that clogs me with this answer

and that well might
advise him to a caution to hold what distance
his wisdom can provide Some holy angel
his message ere he come that a swift blessing
may soon return to this our suffering country
under a hand accurs'd

I'll send my prayers with him

thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd

thrice and once the hedge-pig whin'd

harper cries Tis time tis time


round about the cauldron go
in the poison'd entrails throw
toad that under cold stone
days and nights hast thirty-one
swelter'd venom sleeping got
boil thou first i' the charmed pot
double double toil and trouble
fire burn and cauldron bubble

fillet of a fenny snake
in the cauldron boil and bake
eye of newt and toe of frog
wool of bat and tongue of dog
adder's fork and blind-worm's sting
lizard's leg and howlet's wing
for a charm of powerful trouble
like a hell-broth boil and bubble

double double toil and trouble
fire burn and cauldron bubble

scale of dragon tooth of wolf
witches' mummy maw and gulf
of the ravin'd salt-sea shark
root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark
gall of goat and slips of yew
sliver'd in the moon's eclipse
nose of Turk and Tartar's lips
finger of birth-strangled babe
ditch-deliver'd by a drab
make the gruel thick and slab
add thereto a tiger's chaudron
for the ingredients of our cauldron

double double toil and trouble
fire burn and cauldron bubble

cool it with a baboon's blood
then the charm is firm and good


O well done I commend your pains
and every one shall share i' the gains
and now about the cauldron sing
enchanting all that you put in


by the pricking of my thumbs
something wicked this way comes
open locks
whoever knocks

how now you secret black and mid-night hags
what is t you do

a deed without a name

I conjure you by that which you profess
howe'er you come to know it answer me
though you untie the winds and let them fight
against the churches though the yesty waves
confound and swallow navigation up
though bladed corn be lodg'd and trees blown down
though palaces and pyramids do slope
their heads to their foundations though the treasure
of Nature's germens tumble all together
even till destruction sicken answer me
to what I ask you

speak

demand

we'll answer

say if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths
or from our masters'

call em let me see em


pour in sow's blood that hath eaten
from the murderer's gibbet throw
into the flame

come high or low
thyself and office deftly show

tell me thou unknown power

he knows thy thought
hear his speech but say thou nought

Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth beware Macduff
beware the Thane of Fife Dismiss me Enough


whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks
thou hast harp'd my fear aright But one word more

he will not be commanded here's another


Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth

had I three ears I'd hear thee

be bloody bold and resolute laugh to scorn
the power of man for none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth

then live Macduff what need I fear of thee
but yet I'll make assurance double sure
and take a bond of fate thou shalt not live
that I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies
and sleep in spite of thunder

what is this
that rises like the issue of a king
and wears upon his baby brow the round
and top of sovereignty

listen but speak not to t

be lion-mettled proud and take no care
who chafes who frets or where conspirers are
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
shall come against him


that will never be
who can impress the forest bid the tree
unfix his earth-bound root Sweet bodements good
rebellion's head rise never till the wood
of Birnam rise and our high-plac'd Macbeth
shall live the lease of nature pay his breath
to time and mortal custom Yet my heart
throbs to know one thing tell me if your art
reign in this kingdom

seek to know no more

I will be satisfied deny me this
and an eternal curse fall on you Let me know
why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this


show

show

show

show his eyes and grieve his heart
come like shadows so depart


thy crown does sear mine eyeballs and thy hair
thou other gold-bound brow is like the first
a third is like the former Filthy hags
why do you show me this A fourth Start eyes
what will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
another yet A seventh I'll see no more
and yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
which shows me many more and some I see
that two-fold balls and treble sceptres carry
horrible sight Now I see tis true
for the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me
and points at them for his

what is this so

ay sir all this is so but why
stands Macbeth thus amazedly
come sisters cheer we up his sprites
and show the best of our delights
while you perform your antick round
that this great king may kindly say
our duties did his welcome pay


where are they Gone Let this pernicious hour
stand aye accursed in the calendar
come in without there


what's your Grace's will

saw you the weird sisters

no my lord

came they not by you

no indeed my lord
infected be the air whereon they ride
and damn'd all those that trust them I did hear
the galloping of horse who was t came by

'Tis two or three my lord that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England

fled to England

ay my good lord

time thou anticipat'st my dread exploits
the flighty purpose never is o'ertook
unless the deed go with it from this moment
the very firstlings of my heart shall be
the firstlings of my hand And even now
to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done
the castle of Macduff I will surprise
seize upon Fife give to the edge of the sword
that trace him in his line No boasting like a fool
this deed I'll do before this purpose cool
but no moresights Where are these gentlemen
come bring me where they are


what had he done to make him fly the land

you must have patience madam

he had none
his flight was madness when our actions do not
our fears do make us traitors

you know not
whether it was his wisdom or his fear

wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes
his mansion and his titles in a place
he wants the natural touch for the poor wren
the most diminutive of birds will fight
her young ones in her nest against the owl
all is the fear and nothing is the love
as little is the wisdom where the flight
so runs against all reason

my dearest coz
I pray you school yourself but for your husband
he is noble wise judicious and best knows
the fits o' the season I dare not speak much further
but cruel are the times when we are traitors
and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour
from what we fear yet know not what we fear
but float upon a wild and violent sea
each way and move I take my leave of you
shall not be long but I'll be here again
things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
to what they were before My pretty cousin

father'd he is and yet he's fatherless

I am so much a fool should I stay longer
it would be my disgrace and your discomfort
I take my leave at once


sirrah your father's dead
and what will you do now How will you live

as birds do mother

what with worms and flies

with what I get I mean and so do they

poor bird thou'dst never fear the net nor lime
the pit-fall nor the gin
why should I mother Poor birds they are not set for
my father is not dead for all your saying

yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father

nay how will you do for a husband

why I can buy me twenty at any market

then you'll buy em to sell again

thou speak'st with all thy wit and yet i' faith
with wit enough for thee

was my father a traitor mother

ay that he was

what is a traitor
why one that swears and lies

and be all traitors that do so

every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged

and must they all be hanged that swear and lie

every one

who must hang them

why the honest men

then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them

now God help thee poor monkey
but how wilt thou do for a father


poor prattler how thou talk'st


bless you fair dame I am not to you known
though in your state of honour I am perfect
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
if you will take a homely man's advice
be not found here hence with your little ones
to fright you thus methinks I am too savage
to do worse to you were fell cruelty
which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you
I dare abide no longer


whither should I fly
I have done no harm But I remember now
I am in this earthly world where to do harm
is often laudable to do good sometime
do I put up that womanly defence
to say I have done no harm

what are these faces

where is your husband

I hope in no place so unsanctified
where such as thou mayst find him

he's a traitor

thou liest thou shag-hair'd villain

what you egg
young fry of treachery


he has killed me mother

let us seek out some desolate shade and there
weep our sad bosoms empty

let us rather
hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
bestride our down-fall'n birthdom each new morn
new widowshowl new orphans cry new sorrows
strike heaven on the face that it resounds
as if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
like syllable of dolour

what I believe I'll wail
what know believe and what I can redress
as I shall find the time to friend I will
what you have spoke it may be so perchance
this tyrant whosesole name blisters our tongues
was once thought honest you have lov'd him well
he hath not touch'd you yet I am young but something
to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
to appease an angry god

I am not treacherous

but Macbeth is
a good and virtuous nature may recoil
in an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon
that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
angels are bright still though the brightest fell
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
yet grace must still look so

I have lost my hopes

perchance even there where I did find my doubts
why in that rawness left you wife and child
those precious motives those strong knots of love
without leave-taking I pray you
but mine own safeties you may be rightly just
whatever I shall think

bleed bleed poor country
great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
for goodness dares not check thee wear thou thy wrongs
the title is affeer'd Fare thee well lord
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp
and the rich East to boot

be not offended
I speak not as in absolute fear of you
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke
it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
is added to her wounds I think withal
there would be hands uplifted in my right
and here from gracious England have I offer
of goodly thousands but for all this
or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
shall have more vices than it had before
more suffer and more sundry ways than ever
by him that shall succeed

what should he be

it is myself I mean in whom I know
all the particulars of vice so grafted
that when they shall be open'd black Macbeth
will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
esteem him as a lamb being compar'd
with my confineless harms

not in the legions
of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
in evils to top Macbeth

I grant him bloody
sudden malicious smacking of every sin
that has a name but there's no bottom none
in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
your matrons and your maids could not fill up
the cistern of my lust and my desire
all continent impediments would o'erbear
that did oppose my will better Macbeth
than such an one to reign

boundless intemperance
in nature is a tyranny it hath been
th' untimely emptying of the happy throne
and fall of many kings But fear not yet
to take upon you what is yours you may
convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
we have willing dames enough there cannot be
that vulture in you to devour so many
as will to greatness dedicate themselves

with this there grows
in my most ill-compos'd affection such
a stanchless avarice that were I king
I should cut off the nobles for their lands
desire his jewels and this other's house
and my more-having would be as a sauce
to make me hunger more that I should forge
quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
destroying them for wealth

this avarice
sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
than summer-seeming lust and it hath been
the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
of your mere own all these are portable
with other graces weigh'd

as justice verity temperance stableness
bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
devotion patience courage fortitude
I have no relish of them but abound
in the division of each several crime
acting it many ways Nay had I power I should
pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
uproar the universal peace confound
all unity on earth

O Scotland Scotland

if such a one be fit to govern speak
I am as I have spoken

fit to govern
no not to live O nation miserable
with an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd
when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
by his own interdiction stands accurs'd
and does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father
was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
oft'ner upon her knees than on her feet
died every day she liv'd Fare thee well
these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
have banish'd me from Scotland O my breast
thy hope ends here

Macduff this noble passion
child of integrity hath from my soul
wip'd the black scruples reconcil'd my thoughts
to thy good truth and honour Devilish Macbeth
by many of these trains hath sought to win me
into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
from over-credulous haste but God above
deal between thee and me for even now
I put myself to thy direction and
unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
for strangers to my nature I am yet
unknown to woman never was forsworn
scarcely have coveted what was mine own
at no time broke my faith would not betray
the devil to his fellow and delight
no less in truth than life my first false speaking
was this upon myself What I am truly
is thine and my poor country's to command
whither indeed before thy here-approach
old Siward with ten thousand war-like men
already at a point was setting forth
now we'll together and the chance of goodness
be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent

such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile


well more anon Comes the king forth I pray you
ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
that stay his cure their malady convinces
the great assay of art but at his touch
such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
they presently amend

I thank you doctor


what's the disease he means

'Tis call'd the evil
a most miraculous work in this good king
which often since my here-remain in England
I have seen him do How he solicits heaven
himself best knows but strangely-visited people
all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
the mere despair of surgery he cures
hanging a golden stamp about their necks
to the succeeding royalty he leaves
the healing benediction With this strange virtue
he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
and sundry blessings hang about his throne
that speak him full of grace

see who comes here

my countryman but yet I know him not


my ever-gentle cousin welcome hither

I know him now Good God betimes remove
the means that make us strangers

sir amen

stands Scotland where it did
alas poor country
almost afraid to know itself It cannot
be call'd our mother but our grave where nothing
but who knows nothing is once seen to smile
where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems
a modern ecstasy the dead man's knell
is there scarce ask'd for who and good men's lives
expire before the flowers in their caps
dying or ere they sicken

O relation
too nice and yet too true

what's the newest grief

that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker
each minute teems a new one


why well

and all my children

well too

the tyrant has not batter'd at their peace

no they were well at peace when I did leave em

be not a niggard of your speech how goes t

when I came hither to transport the tidings
which I have heavily borne there ran a rumour
of many worthy fellows that were out
which was to my belief witness'd the rather
for that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot
now is the time of help your eye in Scotland
to doff their dire distresses

be t their comfort
we are coming thither Gracious England hath
lent us good Siward and ten thousand men
an older and a better soldier none
that Christendom gives out

would I could answer
this comfort with the like But I have words
that would be howl'd out in the desert air
where hearing should not latch them

what concern they
the general cause or is it a fee-grief
due to some single breast

no mind that's honest
but in it shares some woe though the main part

if it be mine
keep it not from me quickly let me have it

let not your ears despise my tongue for ever
which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard

hum I guess at it

your castle is surpris'd your wife and babes
savagely slaughter'd to relate the manner
were on the quarry of these murder'd deer
to add the death of you

merciful heaven
what man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows
give sorrow words the grief that does not speak
whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break
my children too

wife children servants all
that could be found

and I must be from thence
my wife kill'd too

I have said

be comforted
let's make us medicine of our great revenge
to cure this deadly grief

he has no children All my pretty ones
did you say all O hell-kite All
what all my pretty chickens and their dam
at one fell swoop


I shall do so
but I must also feel it as a man
I cannot but remember such things were
that were most precious to me Did heaven look on
and would not take their part Sinful Macduff
they were all struck for thee Naught that I am
not for their own demerits but for mine
fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now

be this the whetstone of your sword let grief
convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it

O I could play the woman with mine eyes
and braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens
cut short all intermission front to front
bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
within my sword's length set him if he scape
heaven forgive him too
this tune goes manly
come go we to the king our power is ready
our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth
is ripe for shaking and the powers above
put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may
the night is long that never finds the day

I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report When was it she last walked

since his majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from her bed throw her night-gown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon t read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep

a great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching In this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say

that sir which I will not report after her

you may to me and tis most meet you should

neither to you nor any one having no witness to confirm my speech


how came she by that light

why it stood by her she has light by her continually tis her command

you see her eyes are open

ay but their sense is shut

what is it she does now Look how she rubs her hands

it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands I have known her to continue in this a quarter of an hour

yet here's a spot

hark she speaks I will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly

out damned spot out I say One two why then tis time to do't Hell is murky Fie my lord fie a soldier and afeard What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him


the Thane of Fife had a wife where is she now What will these hands ne'er be clean No more o' that my lord no more o' that you mar all with this starting

go to go to you have known what you should not

she has spoke what she should not I am sure of that Heaven knows what she has known

here's the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand Oh oh oh

what a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged

I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body

well well well

pray God it be sir

this disease is beyond my practice yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds


even so

to bed to bed there's knocking at the gate Come come come come give me your hand What's done cannot be undone
to bed to bed to bed


will she go now to bed

directly

foul whisperings are abroad Unnatural deeds
do breed unnatural troubles infected minds
to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
more needs she the divine than the physician
God God forgive us all Look after her
remove from her the means of all annoyance
and still keep eyes upon her So good-night
my mind she has mated and amaz'd my sight

good-night good doctor


the English power is near led on by Malcolm
his uncle Siward and the good Macduff
revenges burn in them for their dear causes
would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
excite the mortified man

near Birnam wood
shall we well meet them that way are they coming

who knows if Donalbain be with his brother

for certain sir he is not I have a file
of all the gentry there is Siward's son
and many unrough youths that even now
protest their first of manhood
what does the tyrant

great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
some say he's mad others that lesser hate him
do call it valiant fury but for certain
he cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
within the belt of rule

now does he feel
his secret murders sticking on his hands
now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach
those he commands move only in command
nothing in love now does he feel his title
hang loose about him like a giant's robe
upon a dwarfish thief

who then shall blame
his pester'd senses to recoil and start
when all that is within him does condemn

well march we on
to give obedience where tis truly ow'd
meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
and with him pour we in our country's purge
each drop of us

or so much as it needs
to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
make we our march towards Birnam


bring me no more reports let them fly all
till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear What's the boy Malcolm
was he not born of woman The spirits that know
all mortal consequences have pronounc'd me thus
'Fear not Macbeth no man that's born of woman
shall e'er have power upon thee Then fly false thanes
the mind I sway by and the heart I bear
shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear


the devil damn thee black thou cream-fac'd loon

where gott'st thou that goose look

there is ten thousand

geese villain

soldiers sir

go prick thy face and over-red thy fear
thou lily-liver'd boy What soldiers patch
death of thy soul those linen cheeks of thine
are counsellors to fear What soldiers wheyface


take thy face hence

Seyton I am sick at heart
when I behold Seyton I say This push
will cheer me ever or disseat me now
I have liv'd long enough my way of life
is fall'n into the sear the yellow leaf
and that which should accompany old age
as honour love obedience troops of friends
I must not look to have but in their stead
curses not loud but deep mouth-honour breath
which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not
Seyton


what is your gracious pleasure

what news more
all is confirm'd my lord which was reported

I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd
give me my armour

'Tis not needed yet

I'll put it on
send out more horses skirr the country round
hang those that talk of fear Give me mine armour
how does your patient doctor

not so sick my lord
as she is troubled with thick-coming fancies
that keep her from her rest

cure her of that
canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd
pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
and with some sweet oblivious antidote
cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
which weighs upon the heart

therein the patient
must minister to himself

throw physic to the dogs I'll none of it
come put mine armour on give me my staff
Seyton send out Doctor the thanes fly from me
come sir dispatch If thou couldst doctor cast
the water of my land find her disease
and purge it to a sound and pristine health
I would applaud thee to the very echo
that should applaud again Pull t off I say
what rhubarb senna or what purgative drug
would scour these English hence Hear'st thou of them

ay my good lord your royal preparation

bring it after me
I will not be afraid of death and bane
till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane

were I from Dunsinane away and clear
profit again should hardly draw me here

cousins I hope the days are near at hand
that chambers will be safe

we doubt it nothing

what wood is this before us

the wood of Birnam

let every soldier hew him down a bough
and bear t before him thereby shall we shadow
err in report of us

it shall be done

we learn no other but the confident tyrant
keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
our setting down before t

'Tis his main hope
for where there is advantage to be given
both more and less have given him the revolt
and none serve with him but constrained things
whose hearts are absent too

let our just censures
attend the true event and put we on
industrious soldiership

the time approaches
what we shall say we have and what we owe
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
but certain issue strokes must arbitrate
towards which advance the war


hang out our banners on the outward walls
the cry is still They come our castle's strength
will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie
till famine and the ague eat them up
were they not forc'd with those that should be ours
we might have met them dareful beard to beard
and beat them backward home

what is that noise

it is the cry of women my good lord


the time has been my senses would have cool'd
to hear a night-shriek and my fell of hair
would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
as life were in t I have supp'd full with horrors
direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
cannot once start me

wherefore was that cry

the queen my lord is dead

she should have died hereafter
there would have been a time for such a word
to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
creeps in this petty pace from day to day
to the last syllable of recorded time
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death Out out brief candle
life's but a walking shadow a poor player
and then is heard no more it is a tale
told by an idiot full of sound and fury
signifying nothing

thou com'st to use thy tongue thy story quickly

gracious my lord
I should report that which I say I saw
but know not how to do it

well say sir

as I did stand my watch upon the hill
I look'd towards Birnam and anon methought
the wood began to move

liar and slave

let me endure your wrath if't be not so
I say a moving grove

if thou speak'st false
upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
I care not if thou dost for me as much
I pull in resolution and begin
to doubt the equivocation of the fiend
that lies like truth Fear not till Birnam wood
do come to Dunsinane and now a wood
comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out
if this which he avouches does appear
there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
I gin to be aweary of the sun
and wish the estate o' the world were now undone
ring the alarum-bell Blow wind come wrack
at least we'll die with harness on our back


and show like those you are You worthy uncle
shall with my cousin your right-noble son
lead our first battle worthy Macduff and we
shall take upon s what else remains to do
according to our order

fare you well
do we but find the tyrant's power to-night
let us be beaten if we cannot fight

make all our trumpets speak give them all breath
those clamorous harbingers of blood and death


they have tied me to a stake I cannot fly
but bear-like I must fight the course What's he
that was not born of woman Such a one
am I to fear or none

what is thy name

thou'lt be afraid to hear it

no though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
than any is in hell

my name's Macbeth

the devil himself could not pronounce a title
more hateful to mine ear

no nor more fearful

thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st


thou wast born of woman
brandish'd by man that's of a woman born

that way the noise is Tyrant show thy face
if thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine
my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still
I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms
are hir'd to bear their staves either thou Macbeth
or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be
by this great clatter one of greatest note
seems bruited Let me find him fortune
and more I beg not

this way my lord the castle's gently render'd
the tyrant's people on both sides do fight
the noble thanes do bravely in the war
the day almost itself professes yours
and little is to do

that strike beside us

enter sir the castle

why should I play the Roman fool and die
on mine own sword whiles I see lives the gashes
do better upon them


turn hell-hound turn

of all men else I have avoided thee
but get thee back my soul is too much charg'd
with blood of thine already

I have no words
my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
than terms can give thee out

thou losest labour
as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
I bear a charmed life which must not yield
to one of woman born

despair thy charm
and let the angel whom thou still hast serv'd
tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripp'd

accursed be that tongue that tells me so
for it hath cow'd my better part of man
and be these juggling fiends no more believ'd
that palter with us in a double sense
that keep the word of promise to our ear
and break it to our hope I'll not fight with thee

and live to be the show and gaze o' the time
we'll have thee as our rarer monsters are
painted upon a pole and underwrit
'Here may you see the tyrant

I will not yield
to kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet
and to be baited with the rabble's curse
though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane
and thou oppos'd being of no woman born
yet I will try the last before my body
I throw my war-like shield Lay on Macduff
and damn'd be him that first cries Hold enough


I would the friends we miss were safe arriv'd

some must go off and yet by these I see
so great a day as this is cheaply bought
Macduff is missing and your noble son

your son my lord has paid a soldier's debt
he only liv'd but till he was a man
the which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
in the unshrinking station where he fought
but like a man he died

then he is dead

ay and brought off the field Your cause of sorrow
must not be measur'd by his worth for then
it hath no end

had he his hurts before

ay on the front

why then God's soldier be he
I would not wish them to a fairer death
and so his knell is knoll'd

he's worth more sorrow
and that I'll spend for him

he's worth no more
they say he parted well and paid his score
and so God be with him Here comes newer comfort


hail king for so thou art Behold where stands
the usurper's cursed head the time is free
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
that speak my salutation in their minds
whose voices I desire aloud with mine
hail King of Scotland

hail King of Scotland

we shall not spend a large expense of time
before we reckon with your several loves
and make us even with you My thanes and kinsmen
henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland
in such an honour nam'd What's more to do
which would be planted newly with the time
as calling home our exil'd friends abroad
that fled the snares of watchful tyranny
producing forth the cruel ministers
of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
who as tis thought by self and violent hands
took off her life this and what needful else
that calls upon us by the grace of Grace
we will perform in measure time and place
so thanks to all at once and to each one
whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone

OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE
tush Never tell me I take it much unkindly
that thou Iago who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this

'Sblood but you will not hear me
if ever I did dream of such a matter
abhor me

thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate

despise me if I do not Three great ones of the city
in personal suit to make me his lieutenant
off-capp'd to him and by the faith of man
I know my price I am worth no worse a place
but he as loving his own pride and purposes
evades them with a bombast circumstance
horribly stuff'd with epithets of war
and in conclusion
nonsuits my mediators for Certes says he
and what was he
forsooth a great arithmetician
one Michael Cassio a Florentine
a fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife
that never set a squadron in the field
nor the division of a battle knows
more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
wherein the toged consuls can propose
as masterly as he mere prattle without practice
is all his soldiership But he sir had the election
and I of whom his eyes had seen the proof
at Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen must be be-lee'd and calm'd
by debitor and creditor this counter caster
he in good time must his lieutenant be
and I God bless the mark his Moorship's ancient

by heaven I rather would have been his hangman

preferment goes by letter and affection
not by the old gradation where each second
stood heir to the first Now sir be judge yourself
whe'r I in any just term am affin'd
to love the Moor

I would not follow him then

O sir content you
I follow him to serve my turn upon him
we cannot all be masters nor all masters
cannot be truly follow'd You shall mark
many a duteous and knee-crooking knave
that doting on his own obsequious bondage
wears out his time much like his master's ass
for nought but provender and when he's old cashier'd
whip me such honest knaves Others there are
who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty
keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
do well thrive by them and when they have lin'd their coats
do themselves homage these fellows have some soul
and such a one do I profess myself For sir
it is as sure as you are Roderigo
were I the Moor I would not be Iago
in following him I follow but myself
heaven is my judge not I for love and duty
but seeming so for my peculiar end
for when my outward action doth demonstrate
the native act and figure of my heart
in compliment extern tis not long after
but I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
for daws to peck at I am not what I am

what a full fortune does the thick-lips owe
if he can carry t thus

call up her father
rouse him make after him poison his delight
and though he in a fertile climate dwell
plague him with flies though that his joy be joy
yet throw such changes of vexation on t
as it may lose some colour

here is her father's house I'll call aloud

do with like timorous accent and dire yell
as when by night and negligence the fire
is spied in populous cities

what ho Brabantio Signior Brabantio ho

awake what ho Brabantio thieves thieves thieves
look to your house your daughter and your bags
thieves thieves


what is the reason of this terrible summons

Signior is all your family within

are your doors lock'd

why wherefore ask you this

'Zounds sir you're robb'd for shame put on your gown
your heart is burst you have lost half your soul
even now now very now an old black ram
is tupping your white ewe Arise arise
awake the snorting citizens with the bell
or else the devil will make a grandsire of you
arise I say

what have you lost your wits

most reverend signior do you know my voice


my name is Roderigo

the worser welcome
I have charg'd thee not to haunt about my doors
in honest plainness thou hast heard me say
my daughter is not for thee and now in madness
being full of supper and distempering draughts
upon malicious knavery dost thou come
to start my quiet

sir sir sir

but thou must needs be sure
my spirit and my place have in them power
to make this bitter to thee

patience good sir

my house is not a grange

most grave Brabantio
in simple and pure soul I come to you

'Zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans

what profane wretch art thou

I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs

thou art a villain

you are a senator

this thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo

sir I will answer any thing But I beseech you
if t be your pleasure and most wise consent
at this odd-even and dull-watch o' the night
transported with no worse nor better guard
but with a knave of common hire a gondolier
to the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor
if this be known to you and your allowance
we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
but if you know not this my manners tell me
we have your wrong rebuke Do not believe
that from the sense of all civility
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence
your daughter if you have not given her leave
I say again hath made a gross revolt
tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
in an extravagant and wheeling stranger
of here and every where Straight satisfy yourself
if she be in her chamber or your house
let loose on me the justice of the state
for thus deluding you

give me a taper call up all my people
this accident is not unlike my dream
belief of it oppresses me already
light I say light


farewell for I must leave you
it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
to be produc'd as if I stay I shall
against the Moor for I do know the state
however this may gall him with some check
cannot with safety cast him for he's embark'd
with such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
which even now stand in act that for their souls
another of his fathom they have none
to lead their business in which regard
though I do hate him as I do hell-pains
yet for necessity of present life
I must show out a flag and sign of love
lead to the Sagittary the raised search
and there will I be with him So farewell

it is too true an evil gone she is
and what's to come of my despised time
is nought but bitterness Now Roderigo
where didst thou see her O unhappy girl
with the Moor sayst thou Who would be a father
how didst thou know twas she O she deceives me
past thought What said she to you Get more tapers
raise all my kindred Are they married think you

truly I think they are

O heaven How got she out O treason of the blood
fathers from hence trust not your daughters' minds
by what you see them act Are there not charms
by which the property of youth and maidhood
may be abus'd Have you not read Roderigo

yes sir I have indeed

call up my brother O that you had had her
some one way some another Do you know
where we may apprehend her and the Moor

I think I can discover him if you please
to get good guard and go along with me

pray you lead on At every house I'll call
I may command at most Get weapons ho
and raise some special officers of night
on good Roderigo I'll deserve your pains


though in the trade of war I have slain men
yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
to do no contriv'd murder I lack iniquity
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs

'Tis better as it is

nay but he prated
and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
against your honour
that with the little godliness I have
I did full hard forbear him But I pray sir
are you fast married Be assur'd of this
that the magnifico is much belov'd
and hath in his effect a voice potential
as double as the duke's he will divorce you
or put upon you what restraint and grievance
the law with all his might to enforce it on
will give him cable

let him do his spite
my services which I have done the signiory
which when I know that boasting is an honour
I shall promulgate I fetch my life and being
from men of royal siege and my demerits
may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
as this that I have reach'd for know Iago
but that I love the gentle Desdemona
I would not my unhoused free condition
put into circumscription and confine
for the sea's worth But look what lights come yond

those are the raised father and his friends
you were best go in

not I I must be found
my parts my title and my perfect soul
shall manifest me rightly Is it they

by Janus I think no

the servants of the duke and my lieutenant
the goodness of the night upon you friends
what is the news

the duke does greet you general
and he requires your haste-post-haste appearance
even on the instant

what is the matter think you

something from Cyprus as I may divine
it is a business of some heat the galleys
have sent a dozen sequent messengers
this very night at one another's heels
and many of the consuls rais'd and met
are at the duke's already You have been hotly call'd for
when being not at your lodging to be found
the senate hath sent about three several quests
to search you out
'Tis well I am found by you
I will but spend a word here in the house
and go with you


ancient what makes he here

faith he to-night hath boarded a land carrack
if it prove lawful prize he's made for ever

I do not understand

he's married

to who


marry to Come captain will you go


here comes another troop to seek for you

it is Brabantio General be advis'd
he comes to bad intent


holla stand there

Signior it is the Moor

down with him thief


you Roderigo come sir I am for you

keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
good signior you shall more command with years
than with your weapons
O thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter
damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
for I'll refer me to all things of sense
if she in chains of magic were not bound
whether a maid so tender fair and happy
so opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
the wealthy curled darlings of our nation
would ever have to incur a general mock
run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
judge me the world if tis not gross in sense
that thou hast practis'd on her with foul charms
abus'd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
that weaken motion I'll have t disputed on
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
for an abuser of the world a practiser
of arts inhibited and out of warrant
lay hold upon him if he do resist

hold your hands
both you of my inclining and the rest
were it my cue to fight I should have known it
without a prompter Where will you that I go
to answer this your charge

to prison till fit time
of law and course of direct session
call thee to answer

what if I do obey
how may the duke be therewith satisfied
whose messengers are here about my side
upon some present business of the state
to bring me to him

'Tis true most worthy signior
the duke's in council and your noble self

how the duke in council
in this time of the night Bring him away
mine's not an idle cause the duke himself
or any of my brothers of the state
cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own
for if such actions may have passage free
bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be

there is no composition in these news
that gives them credit

indeed they are disproportion'd
my letters say a hundred and seven galleys

and mine a hundred and forty

and mine two hundred
but though they jump not on a just account
'Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm
a Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus

nay it is possible enough to judgment
I do not so secure me in the error
but the main article I do approve
in fearful sense

what ho what ho what ho

a messenger from the galleys


now what's the business

the Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes
so was I bid report here to the state
by Signior Angelo


this cannot be
by no assay of reason tis a pageant
to keep us in false gaze When we consider
the importancy of Cyprus to the Turk
and let ourselves again but understand
that as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes
so may he with more facile question bear it
for that it stands not in such war-like brace
but altogether lacks the abilities
that Rhodes is dress'd in if we make thought of this
we must not think the Turk is so unskilful
to leave that latest which concerns him first
neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
to wake and wage a danger profitless

nay in all confidence he's not for Rhodes

here is more news

the Ottomites reverend and gracious
steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes
have there injointed them with an after fleet

ay so I thought How many as you guess

of thirty sail and now they do re-stem
their backward course bearing with frank appearance
their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
your trusty and most valiant servitor
with his free duty recommends you thus
and prays you to believe him

'Tis certain then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town

he's now in Florence


here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor


valiant Othello we must straight employ you
against the general enemy Ottoman


I did not see you welcome gentle signior
we lack'd your counsel and your help to-night

so did I yours Good your grace pardon me
neither my place nor aught I heard of business
hath rais'd me from my bed nor doth the general care
take hold of me for my particular grief
is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
that it engluts and swallows other sorrows
and it is still itself


my daughter O my daughter

dead

dead

ay to me
she is abus'd stol'n from me and corrupted
by spells and medicines bought of mounte-banks
for nature so preposterously to err
being not deficient blind or lame of sense
sans witchcraft could not

whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
hath thus beguil'd your daughter of herself
and you of her the bloody book of law
you shall yourself read in the bitter letter
after your own sense yea though our proper son

humbly I thank your Grace
here is the man this Moor whom now it seems
your special mandate for the state affairs
hath hither brought

we are very sorry for it

we are very sorry for it

what in your own part can you say to this

nothing but this is so

most potent grave and reverend signiors
my very noble and approv'd good masters
that I have ta'en away this old man's daughter
it is most true true I have married her
the very head and front of my offending
and little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace
for since these arms of mine had seven years' pith
till now some nine moons wasted they have us'd
their dearest action in the tented field
and little of this great world can I speak
more than pertains to feats of broil and battle
and therefore little shall I grace my cause
in speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
what conjuration and what mighty magic
for such proceeding I am charg'd withal
I won his daughter

a maiden never bold
of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature
of years of country credit every thing
to fall in love with what she fear'd to look on
that will confess perfection so could err
against all rules of nature and must be driven
to find out practices of cunning hell
why this should be I therefore vouch again
that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood
or with some dram conjur'd to this effect
he wrought upon her

to vouch this is no proof
without more certain and more overt test
than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
of modern seeming do prefer against him

but Othello speak
did you by indirect and forced courses
subdue and poison this young maid's affections
or came it by request and such fair question
as soul to soul affordeth

send for the lady to the Sagittary
and let her speak of me before her father
if you do find me foul in her report
the trust the office I do hold of you
not only take away but let your sentence
even fall upon my life

fetch Desdemona hither

ancient conduct them you best know the place

and till she come as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood
so justly to your grave ears I'll present
how I did thrive in this fair lady's love
and she in mine

say it Othello

still question'd me the story of my life
from year to year the battles sieges fortunes
that I have pass'd
I ran it through even from my boyish days
to the very moment that he bade me tell it
wherein I spake of most disastrous chances
of moving accidents by flood and field
of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach
of being taken by the insolent foe
and sold to slavery of my redemption thence
and portance in my travel's history
wherein of antres vast and desarts idle
rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
it was my hint to speak such was the process
and of the Cannibals that each other eat
the Anthropophagi and men whose heads
do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear
would Desdemona seriously incline
but still the house-affairs would draw her thence
she'd come again and with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse Which I observing
took once a pliant hour and found good means
to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
that I would all my pilgrimage dilate
whereof by parcels she had something heard
but not intentively I did consent
and often did beguile her of her tears
when I did speak of some distressful stroke
that my youth suffer'd My story being done
she gave me for my pains a world of sighs
she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
'Twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful
she wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd
that heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me
and bade me if I had a friend that lov'd her
I should but teach him how to tell my story
and that would woo her Upon this hint I spake
she lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd
this only is the witchcraft I have us'd
here comes the lady let her witness it


I think this tale would win my daughter too
good Brabantio
take up this mangled matter at the best
men do their broken weapons rather use
than their bare hands

I pray you hear her speak
if she confess that she was half the wooer
destruction on my head if my bad blame
light on the man Come hither gentle mistress
do you perceive in all this noble company
where most you owe obedience

my noble father
I do perceive here a divided duty
my life and education both do learn me
how to respect you you are the lord of duty
I am hitherto your daughter but here's my husband
and so much duty as my mother show'd
to you preferring you before her father
so much I challenge that I may profess
due to the Moor my lord

God be with you I have done
please it your Grace on to the state affairs
I had rather to adopt a child than get it
come hither Moor
I here do give thee that with all my heart
which but thou hast already with all my heart
I would keep from thee For your sake jewel
I am glad at soul I have no other child
for thy escape would teach me tyranny
to hang clogs on them I have done my lord

which as a grize or step may help these lovers
into your favour
when remedies are past the griefs are ended
by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone
is the next way to draw new mischief on
what cannot be preserv'd when Fortune takes
patience her injury a mockery makes
the robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief
he robs himself that spends a bootless grief

so let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile
we lose it not so long as we can smile
he bears the sentence well that nothing bears
but the free comfort which from thence he hears
but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
these sentences to sugar or to gall
being strong on both sides are equivocal
that the bruis'd heart was pierced through the ear
I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state

the Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition

the tyrant custom most grave senators
hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
my thrice-driven bed of down I do agnize
a natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness and do undertake
these present wars against the Ottomites
most humbly therefore bending to your state
I crave fit disposition for my wife
due reference of place and exhibition
with such accommodation and besort
as levels with her breeding

if you please
be t at her father's
I'll not have it so

nor I

nor I I would not there reside
to put my father in impatient thoughts
by being in his eye Most gracious duke
to my unfolding lend your gracious ear
and let me find a charter in your voice
to assist my simpleness

what would you Desdemona

that I did love the Moor to live with him
my downright violence and storm of fortunes
may trumpet to the world my heart's subdu'd
even to the very quality of my lord
I saw Othello's visage in his mind
and to his honours and his valiant parts
so that dear lords if I be left behind
a moth of peace and he go to the war
the rites for which I love him are bereft me
and I a heavy interim shall support
by his dear absence Let me go with him

let her have your voices
vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not
to please the palate of my appetite
nor to comply with heat the young affects
in me defunct and proper satisfaction
but to be free and bounteous to her mind
and heaven defend your good souls that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
for she is with me No when light-wing'd toys
of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dulness
my speculative and offic'd instruments
that my disports corrupt and taint my business
let housewives make a skillet of my helm
make head against my estimation

be it as you shall privately determine
either for her stay or going The affair cries haste
and speed must answer it

you must away to-night

with all my heart

at nine i' the morning here we'll meet again
Othello leave some officer behind
and he shall our commission bring to you
with such things else of quality and respect
as doth import you

so please your Grace my ancient
a man he is of honesty and trust
to his conveyance I assign my wife
to be sent after me

let it be so
good night to every one

and noble signior
if virtue no delighted beauty lack
your son-in-law is far more fair than black

adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well

look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see
she has deceiv'd her father and may thee


my life upon her faith Honest Iago
my Desdemona must I leave to thee
I prithee let thy wife attend on her
and bring them after in the best advantage
of love of worldly matters and direction
to spend with thee we must obey the time


Iago

what sayst thou noble heart

what will I do think'st thou

why go to bed and sleep

I will incontinently drown myself

well if thou dost I shall never love thee after Why thou silly gentleman

it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician

O villanous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen I would change my humanity with a baboon
what should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it

virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and woed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion

it cannot be

it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be a man Drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow these wars defeat thy favour with a usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her It was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida She must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning Make all the money thou canst If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money A pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her

wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue

thou art sure of me go make money I have told thee often and I re-tell thee again and again I hate the Moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will have more of this to-morrow Adieu

where shall we meet i' the morning

at my lodging

I'll be with thee betimes

go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo
what say you

no more of drowning do you hear

I am changed I'll sell all my land

go to farewell put money enough in your purse

thus do I ever make my fool my purse
for I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane
if I would time expend with such a snipe
but for my sport and profit I hate the Moor
and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
he has done my office I know not if t be true
but I for mere suspicion in that kind
will do as if for surety He holds me well
the better shall my purpose work on him
Cassio's a proper man let me see now
to get his place and to plume up my will
after some time to abuse Othello's ear
that he is too familiar with his wife
he hath a person and a smooth dispose
to be suspected framed to make women false
the Moor is of a free and open nature
that thinks men honest that but seem to be so
and will as tenderly be led by the nose
as asses are
I have t it is engender'd hell and night
must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light

what from the cape can you discern at sea

nothing at all it is a high-wrought flood
I cannot twixt the heaven and the main
descry a sail

methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements
what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
can hold the mortise what shall we hear of this

a segregation of the Turkish fleet
for do but stand upon the foaming shore
the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
the wind-shak'd surge with high and monstrous mane
seems to cast water on the burning bear
and quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole
I never did like molestation view
on the enchafed flood

if that the Turkish fleet
be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd
it is impossible they bear it out


news lads our wars are done
the desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks
hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance
on most part of their fleet

how is this true

the ship is here put in
a Veronesa Michael Cassio
lieutenant to the war-like Moor Othello
is come on shore the Moor himself's at sea
and is in full commission here for Cyprus

I am glad on t tis a worthy governor

but this same Cassio though he speak of comfort
touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly
and prays the Moor be safe for they were parted
with foul and violent tempest

pray heaven he be
like a full soldier Let's to the sea-side ho
as well to see the vessel that's come in
as to throw out our eyes for brave Othello
even till we make the main and the aerial blue
an indistinct regard

come let's do so
for every minute is expectancy
of more arrivance


thanks you the valiant of this war-like isle
that so approve the Moor O let the heavens
give him defence against the elements
for I have lost him on a dangerous sea

is he well shipp'd

his bark is stoutly timber'd and his pilot
therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
stand in bold cure

what noise

the town is empty on the brow o' the sea
stand ranks of people and they cry A sail

my hopes do shape him for the governor


they do discharge their shot of courtesy
our friends at least

I pray you sir go forth
and give us truth who tis that is arriv'd

I shall

but good lieutenant is your general wiv'd

most fortunately he hath achiev'd a maid
that paragons description and wild fame
one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
and in th' essential vesture of creation
does tire the ingener

how now who has put in

'Tis one Iago ancient to the general

he has had most favourable and happy speed
tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
the gutter'd rocks and congregated sands
traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel
as having sense of beauty do omit
their mortal natures letting go safely by
the divine Desdemona
what is she

she that I spake of our great captain's captain
left in the conduct of the bold Iago
whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
a se'nnight's speed Great Jove Othello guard
and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
that he may bless this bay with his tall ship
make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms
give renew'd fire to our extinc'ed spirits
and bring all Cyprus comfort


O behold
the riches of the ship is come on shore
ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees
hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven
before behind thee and on every hand


I thank you valiant Cassio
what tidings can you tell me of my lord

he is not yet arriv'd nor know I aught
but that he's well and will be shortly here

O but I fear How lost you company

the great contention of the sea and skies
parted our fellowship But hark a sail


they give their greeting to the citadel
this likewise is a friend

see for the news

good ancient you are welcome
welcome mistress
let it not gall your patience good Iago
that I extend my manners tis my breeding
that gives me this bold show of courtesy


sir would she give you so much of her lips
as of her tongue she oft bestows on me
you'd have enough

alas she has no speech

in faith too much
I find it still when I have list to sleep
marry before your ladyship I grant
she puts her tongue a little in her heart
and chides with thinking

you have little cause to say so
come on come on you are pictures out of doors
bells in your parlours wild cats in your kitchens
saints in your injuries devils being offended
players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds

O fie upon thee slanderer

nay it is true or else I am a Turk
you rise to play and go to bed to work

you shall not write my praise

no let me not

what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me

O gentle lady do not put me to t
for I am nothing if not critical


ay madam

I am not merry but I do beguile
the thing I am by seeming otherwise
come how wouldst thou praise me

I am about it but indeed my invention
comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize
it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours
and thus she is deliver'd
if she be fair and wise fairness and wit
the one's for use the other useth it

well prais'd How if she be black and witty

if she be black and thereto have a wit
she'll find a white that shall her blackness fit


how if fair and foolish

she never yet was foolish that was fair
for even her folly help'd her to an heir

these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish

there's none so foul and foolish thereunto
but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do

O heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself

she that was ever fair and never proud
had tongue at will and yet was never loud
never lack'd gold and yet went never gay
fled from her wish and yet said Now I may
she that being anger'd her revenge being nigh
bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail
she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind
see suitors following and not look behind
she was a wight if ever such wight were

to do what

to suckle fools and chronicle small beer

O most lame and impotent conclusion Do not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husband How say you Cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor

he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar

he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good well kissed an excellent courtesy tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster-pipes for your sake [A trumpet heard ] The Moor I know his trumpet

'Tis truly so

let's meet him and receive him



O my fair warrior

my dear Othello

it gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me O my soul's joy
if after every tempest come such calms
may the winds blow till they have waken'd death
and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
olympus-high and duck again as low
as hell's from heaven If it were now to die
'Twere now to be most happy for I fear
my soul hath her content so absolute
that not another comfort like to this
succeeds in unknown fate

the heavens forbid
even as our days do grow

amen to that sweet powers
I cannot speak enough of this content
it stops me here it is too much of joy
and this and this the greatest discords be

that e'er our hearts shall make

O you are well tun'd now
but I'll set down the pegs that make this music
as honest as I am

come let us to the castle
news friends our wars are done the Turks are drown'd
how does my old acquaintance of this isle
honey you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus
I have found great love amongst them O my sweet
I prattle out of fashion and I dote
go to the bay and disembark my coffers
bring thou the master to the citadel
he is a good one and his worthiness
does challenge much respect Come Desdemona
once more well met at Cyprus


do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come hither If thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me The lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard first I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him

with him why tis not possible

lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in Now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder-out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already

I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition

blessed fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that

yes that I did but that was but courtesy


well

sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity

I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity

I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore
farewell

adieu


that Cassio loves her I do well believe it
that she loves him tis apt and of great credit
the Moor howbeit that I endure him not
is of a constant loving noble nature
and I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
a most dear husband Now I do love her too
I stand accountant for as great a sin
but partly led to diet my revenge
for that I do suspect the lusty Moor
hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof
doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
and nothing can or shall content my soul
till I am even'd with him wife for wife
or failing so yet that I put the Moor
at least into a jealousy so strong
that judgment cannot cure Which thing to do
if this poor trash of Venice whom I trash
for his quick hunting stand the putting on
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip
abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
for I fear Cassio with my night-cap too
make the Moor thank me love me and reward me
for making him egregiously an ass
and practising upon his peace and quiet
even to madness Tis here but yet confus'd


it is Othello's pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello


good Michael look you to the guard to-night
let's teach ourselves that honourable stop
not to outsport discretion

Iago hath direction what to do
but notwithstanding with my personal eye
will I look to t

Iago is most honest
Michael good night to-morrow with your earliest
let me have speech with you

come my dear love
the purchase made the fruits are to ensue
good night

welcome Iago we must to the watch

not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o' the clock Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for Jove

she's a most exquisite lady

and I'll warrant her full of game

indeed she is a most fresh and delicate creature

what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of provocation

an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest

and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love

she is indeed perfection
well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello

not to-night good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment

O they are our friends but one cup I'll drink for you

I have drunk but one cup to-night and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more

what man tis a night of revels the gallants desire it

where are they

here at the door I pray you call them in

I'll do t but it dislikes me


if I can fasten but one cup upon him
with that which he hath drunk to-night already
as my young mistress' dog Now my sick fool Roderigo
whom love has turn'd almost the wrong side out
to Desdemona hath to-night carous'd
potations pottle deep and he's to watch
three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits
that hold their honours in a wary distance
the very elements of this war-like isle
have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups
and they watch too Now mongst this flock of drunkards
am I to put our Cassio in some action
that may offend the isle But here they come
if consequence do but approve my dream
my boat sails freely both with wind and stream


'Fore God they have given me a rouse already

good faith a little one not past a pint as I am a soldier


and let me the canakin clink clink
and let me the canakin clink
a soldier's a man
a life's but a span
why then let a soldier drink

some wine boys

'Fore God an excellent song

I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting your Dane your German and your swag-bellied Hollander drink ho are nothing to your English

is your Englishman so expert in his drinking

why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled

to the health of our general


O sweet England

king Stephen was a worthy peer
his breeches cost him but a crown
he held them sixpence all too dear
with that he call'd the tailor lown
he was a wight of high renown
and thou art but of low degree
'Tis pride that pulls the country down
then take thine auld cloak about thee

some wine ho

why this is a more exquisite song than the other

will you hear t again

no for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things Well God's above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
it's true good lieutenant

for mine own part no offence to the general nor any man of quality I hope to be saved

and so do I too lieutenant

ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient Let's have no more of this let's to our affairs God forgive us our sins Gentlemen let's look to our business Do not think gentlemen I am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left hand I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and speak well enough

excellent well

why very well then you must not think then that I am drunk


to the platform masters come let's set the watch

you see this fellow that is gone before
he is a soldier fit to stand by C sar
and give direction and do but see his vice
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox
I fear the trust Othello puts him in
on some odd time of his infirmity
will shake this island

but is he often thus

'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep
he'll watch the horologe a double set
if drink rock not his cradle

it were well
the general were put in mind of it
perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
and looks not on his evils Is not this true


how now Roderigo
I pray you after the lieutenant go

and tis great pity that the noble Moor
should hazard such a place as his own second
with one of an ingraft infirmity
it were an honest action to say
so to the Moor

not I for this fair island
I do love Cassio well and would do much
to cure him of this evil But hark what noise

you rogue you rascal

what's the matter lieutenant

a knave teach me my duty
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle

beat me
dost thou prate rogue


nay good lieutenant
I pray you sir hold your hand

let me go sir
or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard

come come you're drunk

drunk


away I say go out and cry a mutiny

nay good lieutenant God's will gentlemen
help ho Lieutenant sir Montano sir
help masters Here's a goodly watch indeed
who's that that rings the bell Diablo ho
the town will rise God's will lieutenant hold
you will be sham'd for ever


what is the matter here

'Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death

hold for your lives

hold ho lieutenant Sir Montano gentlemen
have you forgot all sense of place and duty
hold the general speaks to you hold for shame

why how now ho from whence ariseth this
are we turn'd Turks and to ourselves do that
which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites
for Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
from her propriety What is the matter masters
honest Iago that look'st dead with grieving
speak who began this on thy love I charge thee

I do not know friends all but now even now
in quarter and in terms like bride and groom
devesting them for bed and then but now
as if some planet had unwitted men
swords out and tilting one at other's breast
in opposition bloody I cannot speak
any beginning to this peevish odds
and would in action glorious I had lost
those legs that brought me to a part of it

how comes it Michael you are thus forgot

I pray you pardon me I cannot speak
worthy Montano you were wont be civil
the gravity and stillness of your youth
the world hath noted and your name is great
in mouths of wisest censure what's the matter
that you unlace your reputation thus
and spend your rich opinion for the name
of a night-brawler give me answer to it

worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
your officer Iago can inform you
while I spare speech which something now offends me
of all that I do know nor know I aught
by me that's said or done amiss this night
unless self-charity be sometimes a vice
and to defend ourselves it be a sin
when violence assails us

now by heaven
my blood begins my safer guides to rule
assays to lead the way If I once stir
or do but lift this arm the best of you
shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know
how this foul rout began who set it on
and he that is approv'd in this offence
though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth
shall lose me What in a town of war
yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear
to manage private and domestic quarrel
in night and on the court and guard of safety
'Tis monstrous Iago who began t

if partially affin'd or leagu'd in office
thou dost deliver more or less than truth
thou art no soldier

touch me not so near
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
than it should do offence to Michael Cassio
shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general
Montano and myself being in speech
there comes a fellow crying out for he'p
and Cassio following with determin'd sword
to execute upon him Sir this gentleman
steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause
myself the crying fellow did pursue
lest by his clamour as it so fell out
the town might fall in fright he swift of foot
outran my purpose and I return'd the rather
for that I heard the clink and fall of swords
and Cassio high in oath which till to-night
I ne'er might say before When I came back
for this was brief I found them close together
at blow and thrust even as again they were
when you yourself did part them
more of this matter can I not report
but men are men the best sometimes forget
though Cassio did some little wrong to him
yet surely Cassio I believe receiv'd
from him that fled some strange indignity
which patience could not pass

I know Iago
thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee
but never more be officer of mine


look if my gentle love be not rais'd up

I'll make thee an example

what's the matter

all's well now sweeting come away to bed
sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
lead him off
Iago look with care about the town
and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
come Desdemona tis the soldiers' life
to have their balmy slumbers wak'd with strife


what are you hurt lieutenant

ay past all surgery

marry heaven forbid

reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation

as I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more offence in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion Sue to him again and he is yours

I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one's own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil

what was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you
I know not

is t possible

I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts

why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered

it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself

come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good

I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil

come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love you

I have well approved it sir I drunk

you or any man living may be drunk at some time man I'll tell you what you shall do Our general's wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her she'll help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
you advise me well

I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness

I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here

you are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch

good night honest Iago


and what's he then that says I play the villain
when this advice is free I give and honest
probal to thinking and indeed the course
to win the Moor again For tis most easy
the inclining Desdemona to subdue
in any honest suit she's fram'd as fruitful
as the free elements And then for her
to win the Moor were t to renounce his baptism
his soul is so enfetter'd to her love
that she may make unmake do what she list
even as her appetite shall play the god
with his weak function How am I then a villain
to counsel Cassio to this parallel course
directly to his good Divinity of hell
when devils will the blackest sins put on
they do suggest at first with heavenly shows
as I do now for while this honest fool
plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
and she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear
that she repeals him for her body's lust
and by how much she strives to do him good
she shall undo her credit with the Moor
so will I turn her virtue into pitch
and out of her own goodness make the net
that shall enmesh them all


I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice

how poor are they that have not patience
what wound did ever heal but by degrees
thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft
and wit depends on dilatory time
does t not go well Cassio hath beaten thee
and thou by that small hurt hast cashiered Cassio
though other things grow fair against the sun
yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning
pleasure and action make the hours seem short
retire thee go where thou art billeted
away I say thou shalt know more hereafter
nay get thee gone

two things are to be done
my wife must move for Cassio to her mistress
myself the while to draw the Moor apart
and bring him jump when he may Cassio find
soliciting his wife ay that's the way
dull not device by coldness and delay

masters play here I will content your pains
something that's brief and bid Good morrow general

why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak i' the nose thus

how sir how

are these I pray you wind-instruments

ay marry are they sir

O thereby hangs a tail

whereby hangs a tale sir
marry sir by many a wind-instrument that I know But masters here's money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for love's sake to make no more noise with it

well sir we will not

if you have any music that may not be heard to t again but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care

we have none such sir

then put up your pipes in your bag for
I'll away Go vanish into air away


dost thou hear mine honest friend

no I hear not your honest friend I hear you

prithee keep up thy quillets There's a poor piece of gold for thee If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech wilt thou do this

she is stirring sir if she will stir hither

do good my friend


in happy time Iago

you have not been a-bed then

why no the day had broke
before we parted I have made bold Iago
to send in to your wife my suit to her
is that she will to virtuous Desdemona
procure me some access

I'll send her to you presently
and I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
out of the way that your converse and business
may be more free


I never knew
a Florentine more kind and honest


good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry
for your displeasure but all will soon be well
the general and his wife are talking of it
and she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies
that he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
and needs no other suitor but his likings
to take the saf'st occasion by the front
to bring you in again

yet I beseech you
if you think fit or that it may be done
give me advantage of some brief discourse

pray you come in
I will bestow you where you shall have time
to speak your bosom freely

I am much bound to you


these letters give Iago to the pilot
and by him do my duties to the senate
that done I will be walking on the works
repair there to me

well my good lord I'll do t

this fortification gentlemen shall we see t

we'll wait upon your lordship

be thou assur'd good Cassio I will do
all my abilities in thy behalf

good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband
as if the case were his

O that's an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio
but I will have my lord and you again
as friendly as you were

bounteous madam
whatever shall become of Michael Cassio
he's never anything but your true servant

I know t I thank you You do love my lord
you have known him long and be you well assur'd
he shall in strangeness stand no further off
than in a politic distance

that policy may either last so long
or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
or breed itself so out of circumstance
that I being absent and my place supplied
my general will forget my love and service

do not doubt that before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee
if I do vow a friendship I'll perform it
to the last article my lord shall never rest
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience
his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
I'll intermingle every thing he does
with Cassio's suit Therefore be merry Cassio
for thy solicitor shall rather die
than give thy cause away


madam here comes my lord
madam I'll take my leave

why stay and hear me speak

madam not now I am very ill at ease
unfit for mine own purposes

well do your discretion


ha I like not that

what dost thou say

nothing my lord or if I know not what

was not that Cassio parted from my wife

Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it
seeing you coming

I do believe twas he

how now my lord
I have been talking with a suitor here
a man that languishes in your displeasure

who is t you mean

why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord
if I have any grace or power to move you
his present reconciliation take
for if he be not one that truly loves you
that errs in ignorance and not in cunning
I have no judgment in an honest face
I prithee call him back

went he hence now
ay sooth so humbled
that he hath left part of his grief with me
to suffer with him Good love call him back

not now sweet Desdemona some other time

but shall t be shortly

the sooner sweet for you

shall t be to-night at supper

no not to-night

to-morrow dinner then

I shall not dine at home
I meet the captains at the citadel

on Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn
I prithee name the time but let it not
exceed three days in faith he's penitent
and yet his trespass in our common reason
save that they say the wars must make examples
out of their best is not almost a fault
to incur a private check When shall he come
tell me Othello I wonder in my soul
what you could ask me that I should deny
or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio
that came a wooing with you and so many a time
when I have spoke of you dispraisingly
hath ta'en your part to have so much to do
to bring him in Trust me I could do much

prithee no more let him come when he will
I will deny thee nothing

why this is not a boon
or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
to your own person nay when I have a suit
wherein I mean to touch your love indeed
it shall be full of poise and difficult weight
and fearful to be granted

I will deny thee nothing
whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
to leave me but a little to myself

shall I deny you no farewell my lord

farewell my Desdemona I'll come to thee straight

Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you
whate'er you be I am obedient


but I do love thee and when I love thee not
chaos is come again

my noble lord

what dost thou say Iago

did Michael Cassio when you woo'd my lady
know of your love

he did from first to last why dost thou ask

but for a satisfaction of my thought
no further harm

why of thy thought Iago

I did not think he had been acquainted with her


indeed

indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that
is he not honest

honest my lord

honest ay honest

my lord for aught I know

what dost thou think

think my lord

think my lord
by heaven he echoes me
as if there were some monster in his thought
I heard thee say but now thou lik'dst not that
when Cassio left my wife what didst not like
and when I told thee he was of my counsel
in my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed
and didst contract and purse thy brow together
as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
some horrible conceit If thou dost love me
show me thy thought

my lord you know I love you

I think thou dost
and for I know thou art full of love and honesty
and weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath
therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
for such things in a false disloyal knave
are tricks of custom but in a man that's just
they are close delations working from the heart
that passion cannot rule
for Michael Cassio
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest

I think so too

men should be what they seem
or those that be not would they might seem none

certain men should be what they seem

why then I think Cassio s an honest man

nay yet there's more in this
I pray thee speak to me as to thy thinkings
as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
the worst of words

good my lord pardon me
though I am bound to every act of duty
utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false
as where's that palace whereinto foul things
sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure
but some uncleanly apprehensions
keep leets and law days and in session sit
with meditations lawful

thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago
if thou but think'st him wrong'd and mak'st his ear
a stranger to thy thoughts

I do beseech you
though I perchance am vicious in my guess
as I confess it is my nature's plague
to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet
from one that so imperfectly conceits
would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
out of his scattering and unsure observance
nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
to let you know my thoughts

what dost thou mean

good name in man and woman dear my lord
is the immediate jewel of their souls
who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing
'Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands
but he that filches from me my good name
robs me of that which not enriches him
and makes me poor indeed

by heaven I'll know thy thoughts

you cannot if my heart were in your hand
nor shall not whilst tis in my custody

ha
O beware my lord of jealousy
it is the green-ey'd monster which doth mock
the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss
who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
but O what damned minutes tells he o'er
who dotes yet doubts suspects yet soundly loves

O misery

poor and content is rich and rich enough
but riches fineless is as poor as winter
to him that ever fears he shall be poor
good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
from jealousy

why why is this
think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy
to follow still the changes of the moon
with fresh suspicions No to be once in doubt
when I shall turn the business of my soul
to such exsufflicate and blown surmises
matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous
to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
is free of speech sings plays and dances well
where virtue is these are more virtuous
nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
for she had eyes and chose me No Iago
I'll see before I doubt when I doubt prove
and on the proof there is no more but this
away at once with love or jealousy

I am glad of it for now I shall have reason
to show the love and duty that I bear you
with franker spirit therefore as I am bound
receive it from me I speak not yet of proof
look to your wife observe her well with Cassio
wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
out of self-bounty be abus'd look to t
I know our country disposition well
in Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
they dare not show their husbands their best conscience
is not to leave t undone but keep t unknown

dost thou say so

she did deceive her father marrying you
and when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks
she lov'd them most

and so she did

why go to then
she that so young could give out such a seeming
to seel her father's eyes up close as oak
he thought twas witchcraft but I am much to blame
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon

I am bound to thee for ever

I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits

not a jot not a jot

i' faith I fear it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke
comes from my love But I do see you're mov'd
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
to grosser issues nor to larger reach
than to suspicion

I will not

should you do so my lord
my speech should fall into such vile success
as my thoughts aim not at Cassio's my worthy friend

no not much mov'd
I do not think but Desdemona's honest

long live she so and long live you to think so

and yet how nature erring from itself

ay there's the point as to be bold with you
not to affect many proposed matches
of her own clime complexion and degree
whereto we see in all things nature tends
foh one may smell in such a will most rank
foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
but pardon me I do not in position
distinctly speak of her though I may fear
her will recoiling to her better judgment
may fail to match you with her country forms
and happily repent
farewell farewell
if more thou dost perceive let me know more
set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago

my lord I take my leave


why did I marry This honest creature doubtless
sees and knows more much more than he unfolds

my lord I would I might entreat your honour
to scan this thing no further leave it to time
although tis fit that Cassio have his place
for sure he fills it up with great ability
yet if you please to hold him off awhile
you shall by that perceive him and his means
note if your lady strain his entertainment
with any strong or vehement importunity
much will be seen in that In the mean time
as worthy cause I have to fear I am
and hold her free I do beseech your honour

fear not my government

I once more take my leave


this fellow's of exceeding honesty
and knows all qualities with a learned spirit
of human dealings if I do prove her haggard
though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind
to prey at fortune Haply for I am black
and have not those soft parts of conversation
that chamberers have or for I am declin'd
into the vale of years yet that's not much
she's gone I am abus'd and my relief
must be to loathe her O curse of marriage
and not their appetites I had rather be a toad
and live upon the vapour of a dungeon
than keep a corner in the thing I love
for others' uses Yet tis the plague of great ones
prerogativ'd are they less than the base
'Tis destiny unshunnable like death
even then this forked plague is fated to us
when we do quicken
look where she comes
if she be false O then heaven mocks itself
I'll not believe it


how now my dear Othello
your dinner and the generous islanders
by you invited do attend your presence

I am to blame

are you not well

I have a pain upon my forehead here

faith that's with watching twill away again
let me but bind it hard within this hour
it will be well

your napkin is too little

let it alone Come I'll go in with you

I am very sorry that you are not well


I am glad I have found this napkin
this was her first remembrance from the Moor
my wayward husband hath a hundred times
woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token
that she reserves it evermore about her
to kiss and talk to I'll have the work ta'en out
and give t Iago
what he will do with it heaven knows not I
I nothing but to please his fantasy


how now what do you here alone

do not you chide I have a thing for you

a thing for me It is a common thing

ha

to have a foolish wife

O is that all What will you give me now
for that same handkerchief
what handkerchief

what handkerchief
why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona
that which so often you did bid me steal

hast stol'n it from her

no faith she let it drop by negligence
and to the advantage I being there took't up
look here it is

a good wench give it me

what will you do with t that you have been so earnest
to have me filch it

why what's that to you

if it be not for some purpose of import
give t me again poor lady she'll run mad
when she shall lack it

be not acknown on t I have use for it
go leave me

I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin
and let him find it trifles light as air
are to the jealous confirmations strong
as proofs of holy writ this may do something
the Moor already changes with my poison
dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
which at the first are scarce found to distaste
but with a little act upon the blood
burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so
look where he comes


nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep

which thou ow'dst yesterday

ha ha false to me

why how now generall no more of that

avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack
I swear tis better to be much abus'd
than but to know t a little

how now my lord

what sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust
I saw t not thought it not it harm'd not me
I slept the next night well was free and merry
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips
let him not know t and he's not robb'd at all

I am sorry to hear this

I had been happy if the general camp
pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
so I had nothing known O now for ever
farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
that make ambition virtue O farewell
farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
the spirit-stirring drum the ear-piercing fife
the royal banner and all quality
pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
and O you mortal engines whose rude throats
the immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit
farewell Othello's occupation's gone

is it possible my lord
villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
be sure of it give me the ocular proof
or by the worth of mine eternal soul
thou hadst been better have been born a dog
than answer my wak'd wrath

is t come to this

make me to see t or at the least so prove it
that the probation bear no hinge nor loop
to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life

my noble lord

if thou dost slander her and torture me
never pray more abandon all remorse
on horror's head horrors accumulate
do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amaz'd
for nothing canst thou to damnation add

O grace O heaven forgive me
are you a man have you a soul or sense
God be wi' you take mine office O wretched fool
that liv'st to make thine honesty a vice
O monstrous world Take note take note O world
to be direct and honest is not safe
I thank you for this profit and from hence
I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence

nay stay thou shouldst be honest

I should be wise for honesty's a fool
and loses that it works for

by the world
I think my wife be honest and think she is not
I think that thou art just and think thou art not
I'll have some proof Her name that was as fresh
as mine own face If there be cords or knives
poison or fire or suffocating streams
I'll not endure it Would I were satisfied

I see sir you are eaten up with passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
you would be satisfied

would nay I will

and may but how how satisfied my lord
would you the supervisor grossly gape on
behold her tupp'd

death and damnation O

it were a tedious difficulty I think
to bring them to that prospect damn them then
if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
what shall I say Where's satisfaction
it is impossible you should see this
were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
as ignorance made drunk but yet I say
if imputation and strong circumstances
which lead directly to the door of truth
will give you satisfaction you may have it

give me a living reason she's disloyal

I do not like the office
but sith I am enter'd in this cause so far
prick'd to t by foolish honesty and love
I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
and being troubled with a raging tooth
I could not sleep
there are a kind of men so loose of soul
that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
in sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona
let us be wary let us hide our loves
and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard
as if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
that grew upon my lips then laid his leg
over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then
cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor

O monstrous monstrous

nay this was but his dream

but this denoted a foregone conclusion
'Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream

and this may help to thicken other proofs
that do demonstrate thinly


nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
she may be honest yet Tell me but this
have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand

I gave her such a one twas my first gift

I know not that but such a handkerchief
I am sure it was your wife's did I to-day
see Cassio wipe his beard with

if it be that

if it be that or any that was hers
it speaks against her with the other proofs

O that the slave had forty thousand lives
one is too poor too weak for my revenge
all my fond love thus do I blow to heaven
'Tis gone
arise black vengeance from the hollow hell
yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne
to tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught
for tis of aspics' tongues

yet be content

O blood blood blood

patience I say your mind perhaps may change

never Iago Like to the Pontick sea
whose icy current and compulsive course
ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
to the Propontic and the Hellespont
even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love
swallow them up

now by yond marble heaven
in the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words

do not rise yet

witness you ever-burning lights above
you elements that clip us round about
witness that here Iago doth give up
the execution of his wit hands heart
to wrong'd Othello's service Let him command
and to obey shall be in me remorse
what bloody business ever

I greet thy love
not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
and will upon the instant put thee to t
that Cassio's not alive

my friend is dead tis done at your request
but let her live

damn her lewd minx O damn her
come go with me apart I will withdraw
to furnish me with some swift means of death
for the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant

I am your own for ever


do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies

I dare not say he lies any where

why man


go to where lodges he

to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie

can anything be made of this

I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat

can you inquire him out and be edified by report

I will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer

seek him bid him come hither tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf and hope all will be well

to do this is within the compass of man's wit and therefore I will attempt the doing it


where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia
I know not madam

believe me I had rather have lost my purse
full of cruzadoes and but my noble Moor
is true of mind and made of no such baseness
as jealous creatures are it were enough
to put him to ill thinking

is he not jealous

who he I think the sun where he was born
drew all such humours from him

look where he comes

I will not leave him now till Cassio
be call'd to him

how is t with you my lord
well my good lady

O hardness to dissemble
how do you Desdemona

well my good lord

give me your hand This hand is moist my lady

it yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow

this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires
a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
much castigation exercise devout
for here's a young and sweating devil here
that commonly rebels Tis a good hand
a frank one

for twas that hand that gave away my heart

a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands
but our new heraldry is hands not hearts

I cannot speak of this Come now your promise

what promise chuck

I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you

I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
lend me thy handkerchief

here my lord

that which I gave you

I have it not about me
not

no indeed my lord

that is a fault
that handkerchief
did an Egyptian to my mother give
she was a charmer and could almost read
the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
entirely to her love but if she lost it
or made a gift of it my father's eye
should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies She dying gave it me
and bid me when my fate would have me wive
to give it her I did so and take heed on t
make it a darling like your precious eye
to lose't or give't away were such perdition
as nothing else could match
is t possible

'Tis true there's magic in the web of it
a sibyl that had number'd in the world
the sun to course two hundred compasses
in her prophetic fury sew'd the work
the worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk
and it was dy'd in mummy which the skilful
conserv'd of maidens' hearts

indeed is t true

most veritable therefore look to t well

then would to heaven that I had never seen it

ha wherefore

why do you speak so startingly and rash
is t lost is t gone speak is it out o' the way

heaven bless us

say you

it is not lost but what an if it were

how

I say it is not lost

fetch t let me see t

why so I can sir but I will not now
this is a trick to put me from my suit
pray you let Cassio be receiv'd again

fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
come come
you'll never meet a more sufficient man

the handkerchief

I pray talk me of Cassio

the handkerchief

a man that all his time
hath founded his good fortunes on your love
shar'd dangers with you

the handkerchief

in sooth you are to blame

away

is not this man jealous

I ne'er saw this before
sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief
I am most unhappy in the loss of it

'Tis not a year or two shows us a man
they are all but stomachs and we all but food
they eat us hungerly and when they are full
they belch us Look you Cassio and my husband


there is no other way tis she must do t
and lo the happiness go and importune her

how now good Cassio what's the news with you

madam my former suit I do beseech you
that by your virtuous means I may again
whom I with all the office of my heart
entirely honour I would not be delay'd
if my offence be of such mortal kind
that nor my service past nor present sorrows
nor purpos'd merit in futurity
can ransom me into his love again
but to know so must be my benefit
so shall I clothe me in a forc'd content
and shut myself up in some other course
to fortune's alms

alas thrice-gentle Cassio
my advocation is not now in tune
my lord is not my lord nor should I know him
were he in favour as in humour alter'd
so help me every spirit sanctified
as I have spoken for you all my best
and stood within the blank of his displeasure
for my free speech You must awhile be patient
than for myself I dare let that suffice you

is my lord angry

he went hence but now
and certainly in strange unquietness

can he be angry I have seen the cannon
when it hath blown his ranks into the air
and like the devil from his very arm
puff'd his own brother and can he be angry
something of moment then I will go meet him
there's matter in t indeed if he be angry

I prithee do so

something sure of state
either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice
made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him
men's natures wrangle with inferior things
though great ones are their object Tis even so
for let our finger ache and it indues
our other healthful members ev'n to that sense
of pain Nay we must think men are not gods
nor of them look for such observancy
as fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia
I was unhandsome warrior as I am
arraigning his unkindness with my soul
but now I find I had suborn'd the witness
and he's indicted falsely

pray heaven it be state-matters as you think
and no conception nor no jealous toy
concerning you

alas the day I never gave him cause

but jealous souls will not be answer'd so
but jealous for they are jealous tis a monster
begot upon itself born on itself

heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind

lady amen

I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout
if I do find him fit I'll move your suit
and seek to effect it to my uttermost

I humbly thank your ladyship

save you friend Cassio

what make you from home
how is it with you my most fair Bianca
i' faith sweet love I was coming to your house

what keep a week away seven days and nights
eight score eight hours and lovers' absent hours
more tedious than the dial eight score times
O weary reckoning

pardon me Bianca
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd
but I shall in a more continuate time
strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca

take me this work out

O Cassio whence came this
this is some token from a newer friend
to the felt absence now I feel a cause
is t come to this Well well

go to woman
throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth
that this is from some mistress some remembrance
no in good troth Bianca

why whose is it

I know not sweet I found it in my chamber
I like the work well ere it be demanded
as like enough it will I'd have it copied
take it and do t and leave me for this time

leave you wherefore

I do attend here on the general
and think it no addition nor my wish
to have him see me woman'd

why I pray you

not that I love you not
but that you do not love me
I pray you bring me on the way a little
and say if I shall see you soon at night

'Tis but a little way that I can bring you
for I attend here but I'll see you soon

'Tis very good I must be circumstanc'd

will you think so

think so Iago

what
to kiss in private

an unauthoriz'd kiss

or to be naked with her friend a-bed

naked a-bed Iago and not mean harm
it is hypocrisy against the devil
they that mean virtuously and yet do so
the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven

if they do nothing tis a venial slip
but if I give my wife a handkerchief

what then

why then tis hers my lord and being hers
she may I think bestow t on any man

she is protectress of her honour too
may she give that

her honour is an essence that's not seen
they have it very oft that have it not

by heaven I would most gladly have forgot it
thou said'st O it comes o'er my memory
as doth the raven o'er the infected house
boding to all he had my handkerchief

ay what of that

that's not so good now

what
if I had said I had seen him do you wrong
or heard him say as knaves be such abroad
who having by their own importunate suit
or voluntary dotage of some mistress
convinced or supplied them cannot choose
but they must blab

hath he said any thing
he hath my lord but be you well assur'd
no more than he'll unswear

what hath he said

faith that he did I know not what he did

what what

lie

with her

with her on her what you will

lie with her lie on her We say lie on her when they belie her Lie with her that's fulsome Handkerchief confessions handkerchief To confess and be hanged for his labour First to be hanged and then to confess I tremble at it Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction It is not words that shake me thus Pish Noses ears and lips Is it possible Confess Handkerchief O devil


work on
and many worthy and chaste dames even thus
all guitless meet reproach What ho my lord
my lord I say Othello

how now Cassio

what's the matter

my lord is fallen into an epilepsy
this is his second fit he had one yesterday

rub him about the temples

no forbear
the lethargy must have his quiet course
if not he foams at mouth and by and by
breaks out to savage madness Look he stirs
do you withdraw yourself a little while
he will recover straight when he is gone

how is it general have you not hurt your head

dost thou mock me

I mock you no by heaven
would you would bear your fortune like a man

a horned man's a monster and a beast

there's many a beast then in a populous city
and many a civil monster

did he confess it

good sir be a man
think every bearded fellow that's but yok'd
may draw with you there's millions now alive
that nightly lie in those unproper beds
O tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch-mock
to lip a wanton in a secure couch
and to suppose her chaste No let me know
and knowing what I am I know what she shall be

O thou art wise tis certain

stand you awhile apart
confine yourself but in a patient list
whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief
a passion most unsuiting such a man
Cassio came hither I shifted him away
and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy
bade him anon return and here speak with me
the which he promis'd Do but encave yourself
and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
that dwell in every region of his face
for I will make him tell the tale anew
where how how oft how long ago and when
I say but mark his gesture Marry patience
or I shall say you are all in all in spleen
and nothing of a man

dost thou hear Iago
I will be found most cunning in my patience
but dost thou hear most bloody

that's not amiss
but yet keep time in all Will you withdraw

now will I question Cassio of Bianca
a housewife that by selling her desires
buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature
that dotes on Cassio as tis the strumpet's plague
to beguile many and be beguil'd by one
he when he hears of her cannot refrain
from the excess of laughter Here he comes

as he shall smile Othello shall go mad
and his unbookish jealousy must construe
poor Cassio's smiles gestures and light behaviour

quite in the wrong How do you now lieutenant

the worser that you give me the addition
whose want even kills me

ply Desdemona well and you are sure on t


now if this suit lay in Bianca's power
how quickly should you speed

alas poor caitiff

look how he laughs already


alas poor rogue I think i' faith she loves me

now he denies it faintly and laughs it out

do you hear Cassio

now he importunes him
to tell it o'er go to well said well said

she gives it out that you shall marry her
do you intend it

ha ha ha

do you triumph Roman do you triumph

I marry her what a customer I prithee bear some charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome Ha ha ha


faith the cry goes that you shall marry her

prithee say true

I am a very villain else

have you scored me Well

this is the monkey's own giving out she is persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise

Iago beckons me now he begins the story

she was here even now she haunts me in every place I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians and thither come this bauble and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck

crying O dear Cassio as it were his gesture imports it

so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me ha ha ha


well I must leave her company

before me look where she comes

'Tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one

what do you mean by this haunting of me

let the devil and his dam haunt you What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now I was a fine fool to take it I must take out the work A likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there This is some minx's token and I must take out the work There give it your hobby-horse wheresoever you had it I'll take out no work on t

how now my sweet Bianca how now how now

by heaven that should be my handkerchief

an you'll come to supper to-night you may an you will not come when you are next prepared for


after her after her
faith I must she'll rail in the street else

will you sup there

faith I intend so

well I may chance to see you for I would very fain speak with you

prithee come will you

go to say no more


how shall I murder him Iago

did you perceive how he laughed at his vice

O Iago


was that mine

yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he hath given it his whore

I would have him nine years a-killing
a fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman

nay you must forget that

ay let her rot and perish and be damned to-night for she shall not live No my heart is turned to stone I strike it and it hurts my hand O the world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks

nay that's not your way

hang her I do but say what she is So delicate with her needle An admirable musician O she will sing the savageness out of a bear Of so high and plenteous wit and invention

she's the worse for all this

O a thousand a thousand times And then of so gentle a condition
ay too gentle

nay that's certain but yet the pity of it Iago O Iago the pity of it Iago

if you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody

I will chop her into messes Cuckold me

O tis foul in her

with mine officer

that's fouler

get me some poison Iago this night I'll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again This night Iago

do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated

good good the justice of it pleases very good
and for Cassio let me be his undertaker you shall hear more by midnight

excellent good

what trumpet is that same

something from Venice sure Tis Lodovico
come from the duke and see your wife is with him


God save you worthy general

with all my heart sir

the duke and senators of Venice greet you


I kiss the instrument of their pleasures

and what's the news good cousin Lodovico

I am very glad to see you signior
welcome to Cyprus

I thank you How does Lieutenant Cassio

lives sir

cousin there's fall'n between him and my lord
an unkind breach but you shall make all well

are you sure of that

my lord

this fail you not to do as you will

he did not call he's busy in the paper

a most unhappy one I would do much
to atone them for the love I bear to Cassio

fire and brimstone

my lord

are you wise

what is he angry

may be the letter mov'd him
for as I think they do command him home
deputing Cassio in his government

trust me I am glad on t

indeed
my lord

I am glad to see you mad

why sweet Othello

devil


I have not deserved this

my lord this would not be believ'd in Venice
though I should swear I saw t tis very much
make her amends she weeps

O devil devil
if that the earth could teem with woman's tears
each drop she falls would prove a crocodile
out of my sight
I will not stay to offend you


truly an obedient lady
I do beseech your lordship call her back

mistress

my lord

what would you with her sir

who I my lord

ay you did wish that I would make her turn
sir she can turn and turn and yet go on
and turn again and she can weep sir weep
and she's obedient as you say obedient
very obedient Proceed you in your tears
I am commanded home Get you away
I'll send for you anon Sir I obey the mandate
and will return to Venice Hence avaunt

Cassio shall have my place And sir to-night
I do entreat that we may sup together
you are welcome sir to Cyprus Goats and monkeys


is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
call all-in-all sufficient is this the noble nature
whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue
the shot of accident nor dart of chance
could neither graze nor pierce

he is much chang'd

are his wits safe is he not light of brain

what he might be if what he might he is not
I would to heaven he were

what strike his wife

faith that was not so well yet would I knew
that stroke would prove the worst

is it his use
or did the letters work upon his blood
and new-create this fault

alas alas
it is not honesty in me to speak
what I have seen and known You shall observe him
and his own courses will denote him so
that I may save my speech Do but go after
and mark how he continues



you have seen nothing then

nor ever heard nor ever did suspect

yes you have seen Cassio and her together

but then I saw no harm and then I heard
each syllable that breath made up between them

what did they never whisper

never my lord

nor send you out o' the way

never


never my lord

that's strange

I durst my lord to wager she is honest
lay down my soul at stake if you think other
remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
if any wretch have put this in your head
let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse
for if she be not honest chaste and true
there's no man happy the purest of their wives
is foul as slander

bid her come hither go

she says enough yet she's a simple bawd
that cannot say as much This is a subtle whore
a closet lock and key of villanous secrets


my lord what is your will

pray chuck come hither

what is your pleasure

let me see your eyes
look in my face

what horrible fancy's this

some of your function mistress
leave procreants alone and shut the door
cough or cry hem' if any body come
your mystery your mystery nay dispatch


I understand a fury in your words
but not the words

why what art thou

your wife my lord your true
and loyal wife

come swear it damn thyself
lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
should fear to seize thee therefore be double-damn'd
swear thou art honest

heaven doth truly know it

heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell

to whom my lord with whom how am I false


alas the heavy day Why do you weep
am I the motive of these tears my lord
if haply you my father do suspect
an instrument of this your calling back
lay not your blame on me if you have lost him
why I have lost him too

had it pleas'd heaven
to try me with affliction had he rain'd
all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
steep'd me in poverty to the very lips
given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
I should have found in some part of my soul
a drop of patience but alas to make me
the fixed figure for the time of scorn
to point his slow and moving finger at
yet could I bear that too well very well
but there where I have garner'd up my heart
the fountain from the which my current runs
or else dries up to be discarded thence
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
to knot and gender in Turn thy complexion there
patience thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin
ay there look grim as hell

I hope my noble lord esteems me honest

O ay as summer flies are in the shambles
that quicken even with blowing O thou weed
who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born

alas what ignorant sin have I committed

was this fair paper this most goodly book
made to write whore' upon What committed
committed O thou public commoner
that would to cinders burn up modesty
did I but speak thy deeds What committed
heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth
and will not hear it What committed
impudent strumpet

by heaven you do me wrong

are not you a strumpet

no as I am a Christian
if to preserve this vessel for my lord
from any other foul unlawful touch
be not to be a strumpet I am none

what not a whore


is it possible

O heaven forgive us

I cry you mercy then
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
that married with Othello You mistress
that have the office opposite to Saint Peter
and keep the gate of hell


you you ay you
we have done our course there's money for your pains
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel

alas what does this gentleman conceive
how do you madam how do you my good lady


good madam what's the matter with my lord

with who

why with my lord madam

who is thy lord

he that is yours sweet lady

I have none do not talk to me Emilia
I cannot weep nor answer have I none
but what should go by water Prithee to-night
lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember
and call thy husband hither

here is a change indeed

'Tis meet I should be us'd so very meet
how have I been behav'd that he might stick
the small'st opinion on my least misuse


what is your pleasure madam How is it with you

I cannot tell Those that do teach young babes
do it with gentle means and easy tasks
he might have chid me so for in good faith
I am a child to chiding

what's the matter lady

alas Iago my lord hath so bewhor'd her
thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
as true hearts cannot bear

am I that name Iago
what name fair lady

such as she says my lord did say I was

he call'd her whore a beggar in his drink
could not have laid such terms upon his callat

why did he so

I do not know I am sure I am none such

do not weep do not weep Alas the day

has she forsook so many noble matches
her father and her country and her friends
to be call'd whore would it not make one weep

it is my wretched fortune

how comes this trick upon him

nay heaven doth know

I will be hang'd if some eternal villain
some busy and insinuating rogue
some cogging cozening slave to get some office
have not devis'd this slander I'll be hang'd else

fie there is no such man it is impossible

if any such there be heaven pardon him

a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones
why should he call her whore who keeps her company
what place what time what form what likelihood
the Moor's abus'd by some most villanous knave
some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
O heaven that such companions thou'dst unfold
to lash the rascals naked through the world
even from the east to the west

speak within door

O fie upon them Some such squire he was
that turn'd your wit the seamy side without
and made you to suspect me with the Moor

you are a fool go to

O good Iago
what shall I do to win my lord again
good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
I know not how I lost him Here I kneel
if e'er my will did trespass gainst his love
either in discourse of thought or actual deed
or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
delighted them in any other form
and ever will though he do shake me off
to beggarly divorcement love him dearly
comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much
and his unkindness may defeat my life
but never taint my love I cannot say whore
it does abhor me now I speak the word
to do the act that might the addition earn
not the world's mass of vanity could make me

I pray you be content tis but his humour
the business of the state does him offence
and he does chide with you

if twere no other

'Tis but so I warrant

hark how these instruments summon to supper
the messengers of Venice stay the meat


how now Roderigo

I do not find that thou dealest justly with me

what in the contrary

every day thou daffest me with some device Iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope I will indeed no longer endure it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered

will you hear me Roderigo

faith I have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin together

you charge me most unjustly

with nought but truth I have wasted myself out of my means The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she has received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but I find none

well go to very well
very well go to I cannot go to man nor tis not very well by this hand I say it is very scurvy and begin to find myself fobbed in it

very well

I tell you tis not very well I will make myself known to Desdemona if she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you

you have said now

ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing

why now I see there's mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before Give me thy hand Roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair

it hath not appeared

I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment But Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which I have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean purpose courage and valour this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life

well what is it is it within reason and compass

sir there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place
is that true why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice

O no he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio

how do you mean removing of him

why by making him uncapable of Othello's place knocking out his brains

and that you would have me do

ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right He sups to-night with a harlotry and thither will I go to him he knows not yet of his honourable fortune If you will watch his going thence which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure I will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us Come stand not amazed at it but go along with me I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him It is now high supper-time and the night grows to waste about it

I will hear further reason for this

and you shall be satisfied


I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further


madam good night I humbly thank your ladyship

your honour is most welcome

will you walk sir
O Desdemona

my lord

get you to bed on the instant I will be returned forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done

I will my lord


how goes it now he looks gentler than he did

he says he will return incontinent
he hath commanded me to go to bed

dismiss me

it was his bidding therefore good Emilia
give me my nightly wearing and adieu
we must not now displease him

I would you had never seen him

so would not I my love doth so approve him
that even his stubbornness his checks and frowns
prithee unpin me have grace and favour in them

I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed

all's one Good faith how foolish are our minds
if I do die before thee prithee shroud me
in one of those same sheets


my mother had a maid call'd Barbara
she was in love and he she lov'd prov'd mad
and did forsake her she had a song of willow
an old thing twas but it express'd her fortune
and she died singing it that song to-night
will not go from my mind I have much to do
but to go hang my head all at one side
and sing it like poor Barbara Prithee dispatch

shall I go fetch your night-gown

no unpin me here
this Lodovico is a proper man

a very handsome man

he speaks well



the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
sing all a green willow
her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
sing willow willow willow
the fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans
sing willow willow willow
her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones

lay by these

sing willow willow willow

prithee hie thee he'll come anon

sing all a green willow must be my garland
let nobody blame him his scorn I approve


it is the wind


I call'd my love false love but what said he then
sing willow willow willow
if I court moe women you'll couch with moe men

so get thee gone good night Mine eyes do itch
doth that bode weeping

'Tis neither here nor there

I have heard it said so O these men these men
dost thou in conscience think tell me Emilia
that there be women do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind

there be some such no question
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world

why would not you

no by this heavenly light

nor I neither by this heavenly light might do t as well i' the dark

wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world

the world is a huge thing tis a great price
for a small vice

in troth I think thou wouldst not

in troth I think I should and undo t when I had done Marry I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring nor measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch I should venture purgatory for t

beshrew me if I would do such a wrong
for the whole world
why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world and having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right

I do not think there is any such woman

yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for
but I do think it is their husbands' faults
if wives do fall Say that they slack their duties
and pour our treasures into foreign laps
or else break out in peevish jealousies
throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
or scant our former having in despite
why we have galls and though we have some grace
yet have we some revenge Let husbands know
their wives have sense like them they see and smell
and have their palates both for sweet and sour
as husbands have What is it that they do
when they change us for others Is it sport
I think it is and doth affection breed it
I think it doth is t frailty that thus errs
desires for sport and frailty as men have
then let them use us well else let them know
the ills we do their ills instruct us so

good night good night heaven me such usage send
not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend

here stand behind this bulk straight will he come
wear thy good rapier bare and put it home
quick quick fear nothing I'll be at thy elbow
it makes us or it mars us think on that
and fix most firm thy resolution

be near at hand I may miscarry in t

here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand


I have no great devotion to the deed
'Tis but a man gone forth my sword he dies

I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense
and he grows angry Now whether he kill Cassio
or Cassio him or each do kill the other
every way makes my gain live Roderigo
he calls me to a restitution large
of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him
as gifts to Desdemona
it must not be if Cassio do remain
he hath a daily beauty in his life
that makes me ugly and besides the Moor
may unfold me to him there stand I in much peril
no he must die But so I hear him coming


I know his gait tis he Villain thou diest


but that my coat is better than thou know'st
I will make proof of thine


O I am slain


I am maim'd for ever Help ho murder murder

the voice of Cassio Iago keeps his word

O villain that I am

it is e'en so

O help ho light a surgeon

'Tis he O brave Iago honest and just
that hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong
and your unblest fate hies strumpet I come
forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted
thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted

what ho no watch no passage murder murder

'Tis some mischance the cry is very direful

O help

hark

O wretched villain

two or three groan it is a heavy night
these may be counterfeits let's think t unsafe
to come in to the cry without more help

nobody come then shall I bleed to death
hark


here's one comes in his shirt with light and weapons

who's there whose noise is this that cries on murder

we do not know

did not you hear a cry

here here for heaven's sake help me

what's the matter

this is Othello's ancient as I take it

the same indeed a very valiant fellow


Iago O I am spoil'd undone by villains
give me some help

O me lieutenant what villains have done this

I think that one of them is hereabout
and cannot make away

O treacherous villains


what are you there come in and give some help

O help me here

that's one of them

O murderous slave O villain

O damn'd Iago O inhuman dog

kill men i' the dark Where be these bloody thieves
how silent is this town Ho murder murder
what may you be are you of good or evil

as you shall prove us praise us

Signior Lodovico

he sir

I cry you mercy Here's Cassio hurt by villains

Cassio

how is it brother


marry heaven forbid
light gentlemen I'll bind it with my shirt


what is the matter ho who is t that cried

who is t that cried

O my dear Cassio my sweet Cassio
O Cassio Cassio Cassio

O notable strumpet Cassio may you suspect
who they should be that have thus mangled you

no

I am sorry to find you thus I have been to seek you

to bear him easily hence

alas he faints O Cassio Cassio Cassio

gentlemen all I do suspect this trash
to be a party in this injury
patience awhile good Cassio Come come
lend me a light Know we this face or no
alas my friend and my dear countryman
Roderigo no yes sure O heaven Roderigo

what of Venice

even he sir did you know him

know him ay

Signior Gratiano I cry you gentle pardon
these bloody accidents must excuse my manners

I am glad to see you

how do you Cassio O a chair a chair

Roderigo


he he tis he O that's well said the chair
some good men bear him carefully from hence
I'll fetch the general's surgeon

for you mistress
save you your labour He that lies slain here Cassio
was my dear friend What malice was between you

none in the world nor do I know the man

what look you pale O bear him out o' the air
stay you good gentlemen Look you pale mistress
do you perceive the gastness of her eye
nay if you stare we shall hear more anon
behold her well I pray you look upon her
do you see gentlemen nay guiltiness will speak
though tongues were out of use


'Las what's the matter what's the matter husband

Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
by Roderigo and fellows that are scap'd
he's almost slain and Roderigo dead

alas good gentleman alas good Cassio

this is the fruit of whoring Prithee Emilia
go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night
what do you shake at that
he supp'd at my house but I therefore shake not

O did he so I charge you go with me

fie fie upon thee strumpet

I am no strumpet but of life as honest
as you that thus abuse me

as I foh fie upon thee

kind gentlemen let's go see poor Cassio dress'd
come mistress you must tell s another tale
Emilia run you to the citadel
and tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd
will you go on afore

this is the night
that either makes me or fordoes me quite

it is the cause it is the cause my soul
let me not name it to you you chaste stars
it is the cause Yet I'll not shed her blood
nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
and smooth as monumental alabaster
yet she must die else she'll betray more men
put out the light and then put out the light
if I quench thee thou flaming minister
I can again thy former light restore
should I repent me but once put out thy light
thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature
I know not where is that Promethean heat
that can thy light relume When I have pluck'd the rose
I cannot give it vital growth again
it needs must wither I'll smell it on the tree

O balmy breath that dost almost persuade
justice to break her sword One more one more
and love thee after One more and this the last
so sweet was ne'er so fatal I must weep
but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly
it strikes where it doth love She wakes

who's there Othello

ay Desdemona

will you come to bed my lord

have you pray'd to-night Desdemona

ay my lord

if you bethink yourself of any crime
unreconcil'd as yet to heaven and grace
solicit for it straight


well do it and be brief I will walk by
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit
no heaven forfend I would not kill thy soul

talk you of killing

ay I do

then heaven
have mercy on me

amen with all my heart

if you say so I hope you will not kill me

hum

and yet I fear you for you are fatal then
since guiltiness I know not but yet I feel I fear

think on thy sins

they are loves I bear to you

ay and for that thou diest

that death's unnatural that kills for loving
alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
some bloody passion shakes your very frame
these are portents but yet I hope I hope
they do not point on me

peace and be still

I will so What's the matter

that handkerchief which I so lov'd and gave thee

no by my life and soul
send for the man and ask him

sweet soul take heed
take heed of perjury thou'rt on thy death-bed

ay but not yet to die

yes presently
therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
for to deny each article with oath
cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
that I do groan withal Thou art to die

then Lord have mercy on me

I say amen

offend you in my life never lov'd Cassio
but with such general warranty of heaven
as I might love I never gave him token

by heaven I saw my handkerchief in s hand
O perjur'd woman thou dost stone my heart
and mak'st me call what I intend to do
a murder which I thought a sacrifice
I saw the handkerchief

he found it then
I never gave it him Send for him hither
let him confess a truth

he hath confess'd

what my lord

that he hath us'd thee
how unlawfully

ay

he will not say so

no his mouth is stopp'd
honest Iago hath ta'en order for t

O my fear interprets What is he dead

had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
had stomach for them all

alas he is betray'd and I undone

out strumpet Weep'st thou for him to my face

O banish me my lord but kill me not
down strumpet

kill me to-morrow let me live to-night

nay if you strive

but half an hour

being done there is no pause

but while I say one prayer

it is too late


my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord

what noise is this Not dead not yet quite dead
I that am cruel am yet merciful
so so

what ho my lord my lord

who's there

O good my lord I would speak a word with you

yes tis Emilia by and by She's dead
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death
the noise was high Ha no more moving
still as the grave Shall she come in Were t good
I think she stirs again no What's best to do
if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife
my wife my wife what wife I have no wife
O insupportable O heavy hour
methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
should yawn at alteration
I do beseech you
that I may speak with you O good my lord

I had forgot thee O come in Emilia
soft by and by let me the curtains draw
where art thou


what's the matter with thee now

O my good lord yonder's foul murder done

what now

but now my lord

it is the very error of the moon
she comes more near the earth than she was wont
and makes men mad
Cassio my lord has kill'd a young Venetian
call'd Roderigo

Roderigo kill'd
and Cassio kill'd

no Cassio is not kill'd

not Cassio kill'd then murder's out of tune
and sweet revenge grows harsh

O falsely falsely murder'd

alas what cry is that

that what

out and alas that was my lady's voice
help Help ho help O lady speak again

a guiltless death I die

O who hath done this deed

nobody I myself farewell
commend me to my kind lord O farewell


why how should she be murder'd

alas who knows

you heard her say herself it was not I

she said so I must needs report the truth

she's like a liar gone to burning hell
'Twas I that kill'd her
O the more angel she
and you the blacker devil

she turn'd to folly and she was a whore

thou dost belie her and thou art a devil

she was false as water

thou art rash as fire to say
that she was false O she was heavenly true

Cassio did tup her ask thy husband else
O I were damn'd beneath all depth in bell
but that I did proceed upon just grounds
to this extremity Thy husband knew it all

my husband


that she was false to wedlock

ay with Cassio Nay had she been true
if heaven would make me such another world
of one entire and perfect chrysolite
I'd not have sold her for it

my husband

ay twas he that told me first
an honest man he is and hates the slime
that sticks on filthy deeds

my husband

what needs this iterance woman I say thy husband

O mistress villany hath made mocks with love

he woman
I say thy husband dost understand the word
my friend thy husband honest honest Iago

if he say so may his pernicious soul
rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart
she was too fond of her most filthy bargain

ha

do thy worst
this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
than thou wast worthy her

peace you were best

thou hast not half the power to do me harm
as I have to be hurt O gull O dolt
I care not for thy sword I'll make thee known
though I lost twenty lives Help help ho help
the Moor has kill'd my mistress Murder murder


what is the matter How now general

O are you come Iago you have done well
that men must lay their murders on your neck

what is the matter

disprove this villain if thou be'st a man
he says thou told'st him that his wife was false
I know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain
speak for my heart is full

I told him what I thought and told no more
than what he found himself was apt and true
but did you ever tell him she was false

I did

you told a lie an odious damned lie
upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
she false with Cassio Did you say with Cassio

with Cassio mistress Go to charm your tongue

I will not charm my tongue I am bound to speak
my mistress here lies murder'd in her bed

O heavens forfend

and your reports have set the murder on

nay stare not masters it is true indeed


O monstrous act

villany villany villany
I think upon t I think I smell t O villany
I thought so then I'll kill myself for grief
O villany villany

what are you mad I charge you get you home

good gentlemen let me have leave to speak
'Tis proper I obey him but not now
perchance Iago I will ne'er go home

O O O 


nay lay thee down and roar
for thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent

O she was foul
I scarce did know you uncle There lies your niece
whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd
I know this act shows terrible and grim

poor Desdemona I am glad thy father's dead
thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
shore his old thread in twain did he live now
this sight would make him do a desperate turn
yea curse his better angel from his side
and fall to reprobation

'Tis pitiful but yet Iago knows
that she with Cassio hath the act of shame
a thousand times committed Cassio confess'd it
and she did gratify his amorous works
with that recognizance and pledge of love
which I first gave her I saw it in his hand
my father gave my mother

O heaven O heavenly powers

come hold your peace

'Twill out twill out I hold my peace air no
no I will speak as liberal as the north
let heaven and men and devils let them all
all all cry shame against me yet I'll speak

be wise and get you home

I will not


fie
your sword upon a woman

I found by fortune and did give my husband
for often with a solemn earnestness
more than indeed belong'd to such a trifle
he begg'd of me to steal it

villanous whore

she give it Cassio no alas I found it
and I did give t my husband

filth thou liest

by heaven I do not I do not gentlemen
O murderous coxcomb what should such a fool
do with so good a wife

are there no stones in heaven
but what serve for the thunder Precious villain

the woman falls sure he has kill'd his wife

ay ay O lay me by my mistress' side

he's gone but his wife's kill'd

'Tis a notorious villain Take you this weapon
which I have here recover'd from the Moor
come guard the door without let him not pass
but kill him rather I'll after that same villain
for tis a damned slave


I am not valiant neither
but every puny whipster gets my sword
but why should honour outlive honesty
let it go all

what did thy song bode lady
and die in music
willow willow willow
Moor she was chaste she lov'd thee cruel Moor
so come my soul to bliss as I speak true
so speaking as I think I die I die


I have another weapon in this chamber
it is a sword of Spain the ice brook's temper
O here it is Uncle I must come forth

if thou attempt it it will cost thee dear
thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer

look in upon me then and speak with me
or naked as I am I will assault thee


what is the matter
behold I have a weapon
a better never did itself sustain
upon a soldier's thigh I have seen the day
that with this little arm and this good sword
I have made my way through more impediments
than twenty times your stop but O vain boast
who can control his fate tis not so now
be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd
here is my journey's end here is my butt
and very sea-mark of my utmost sail
do you go back dismay'd tis a lost fear
man but a rush against Othello's breast
and he retires Where should Othello go
now how dost thou look now O ill-starr'd wench
pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt
this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
and fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl
even like thy chastity
O cursed cursed slave Whip me ye devils
blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur
wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire
O Desdemona Desdemona dead
oh Oh Oh


where is this rash and most unfortunate man

that's he that was Othello here I am

where is that viper bring the villain forth

I look down towards his feet but that's a fable
if that thou be'st a devil I cannot kill thee


wrench his sword from him

I bleed sir but not kill'd
I am not sorry neither I'd have thee live
for in my sense tis happiness to die

O thou Othello that wert once so good
fall'n in the practice of a damned slave
what shall be said to thee

why any thing
an honourable murderer if you will
for nought did I in hate but all in honour

this wretch hath part confess'd his villany
did you and he consent in Cassio's death

ay

dear general I never gave you cause

I do believe it and I ask your pardon
why he hath thus ensnar'd my soul and body

demand me nothing what you know you know
from this time forth I never will speak word

what not to pray

torments will ope your lips

well thou dost best

sir you shall understand what hath befall'n
which as I think you know not Here is a letter
found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo
and here another the one of them imports
the death of Cassio to be undertook
by Roderigo

O villain
most heathenish and most gross

now here's another discontented paper
found in his pocket too and this it seems
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
but that belike Iago in the interim
came in and satisfied him

O the pernicious caitiff
how came you Cassio by that handkerchief
that was my wife's

I found it in my chamber
and he himself confess'd but even now
that there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
which wrought to his desire

O fool fool fool

how he upbraids Iago that he made him
brave me upon the watch whereon it came
that I was cast and even but now he spake
after long seeming dead Iago hurt him
Iago set him on

you must forsake this room and go with us
your power and your command is taken off
and Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave
if there be any cunning cruelty
that can torment him much and hold him long
it shall be his You shall close prisoner rest
till that the nature of your fault be known
to the Venetian state Come bring him away

soft you a word or two before you go
I have done the state some service and they know't
no more of that I pray you in your letters
when you shall these unlucky deeds relate
nor set down aught in malice then must you speak
of one that lov'd not wisely but too well
of one not easily jealous but being wrought
perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand
like the base Indian threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe of one whose subdu'd eyes
albeit unused to the melting mood
drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
their med'cinable gum Set you down this
and say besides that in Aleppo once
where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
beat a Venetian and traduc'd the state
I took by the throat the circumcised dog
and smote him thus


O bloody period

all that's spoke is marr'd
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee no way but this

killing myself to die upon a kiss


this did I fear but thought he had no weapon
for he was great of heart

O Spartan dog
more fell than anguish hunger or the sea
look on the tragic loading of this bed
this is thy work the object poisons sight
let it be hid Gratiano keep the house
and seize upon the fortunes of the Moor
for they succeed on you To you lord governor
remains the censure of this hellish villain
the time the place the torture O enforce it
myself will straight aboard and to the state
this heavy act with heavy heart relate
ROMEO AND JULIET

two households both alike in dignity
in fair Verona where we lay our scene
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny
where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life
whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
do with their death bury their parents' strife
the fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
and the continuance of their parents' rage
which but their children's end nought could remove
is now the two hours' traffick of our stage
the which if you with patient ears attend
what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend

Gregory o' my word we'll not carry coals


I mean an we be in choler we'll draw

ay while you live draw your neck out o' the collar

I strike quickly being moved

but thou art not quickly moved to strike

a dog of the house of Montague moves me

to move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand therefore if thou art moved thou runnest away

a dog of that house shall move me to stand I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's

that shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes to the wall

'Tis true and therefore women being the weaker vessels are ever thrust to the wall therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall


'Tis all one I will show myself a tyrant when I have fought with the men I will be cruel with the maids I will cut off their heads

the heads of the maids

ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads take it in what sense thou wilt

they must take it in sense that feel it

me they shall feel while I am able to stand and tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh

'Tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou hadst been poor John Draw thy tool here comes two of the house of the Montagues


my naked weapon is out quarrel I will back thee

how turn thy back and run

fear me not
no marry I fear thee

let us take the law of our sides let them begin

I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as they list

nay as they dare I will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them if they bear it

do you bite your thumb at us sir

I do bite my thumb sir

do you bite your thumb at us sir

is the law of our side if I say ay

no

no sir I do not bite my thumb at you sir but I bite my thumb sir
do you quarrel sir

quarrel sir no sir

if you do sir I am for you I serve as good a man as you

no better

well sir

say better here comes one of my master's kinsmen

yes better sir

you lie

draw if you be men Gregory remember thy swashing blow

part fools

what art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
turn-thee Benvolio look upon thy death

I do but keep the peace put up thy sword
or manage it to part these men with me

what drawn and talk of peace I hate the word
as I hate hell all Montagues and thee
have at thee coward


clubs bills and partisans strike beat them down
down with the Capulets down with the Montagues


what noise is this Give me my long sword ho

a crutch a crutch Why call you for a sword
my sword I say Old Montague is come
and flourishes his blade in spite of me


thou villain Capulet Hold me not let me go

thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe


rebellious subjects enemies to peace
profaners of this neighbour-stained steel
will they not hear What ho you men you beasts
that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
with purple fountains issuing from your veins
on pain of torture from those bloody hands
throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground
and hear the sentence of your moved prince
three civil brawls bred of an airy word
by thee old Capulet and Montague
and made Verona's ancient citizens
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
to wield old partisans in hands as old
canker'd with peace to part your canker'd hate
if ever you disturb our streets again
your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
for this time all the rest depart away
you Capulet shall go along with me
and Montague come you this afternoon
to know our further pleasure in this case
to old Free-town our common judgment-place
once more on pain of death all men depart


who set this ancient quarrel new a-broach
speak nephew were you by when it began

here were the servants of your adversary
and yours close fighting ere I did approach
the fiery Tybalt with his sword prepar'd
which as he breath'd defiance to my ears
he swung about his head and cut the winds
who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
came more and more and fought on part and part
till the prince came who parted either part

O where is Romeo saw you him to-day
right glad I am he was not at this fray

madam an hour before the worshipp'd sun
peer'd forth the golden window of the east
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
where underneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from the city's side
so early walking did I see your son
towards him I made but he was ware of me
and stole into the covert of the wood
that most are busied when they're most alone
pursu'd my humour not pursuing his
and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me

many a morning hath he there been seen
with tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
but all so soon as the all-cheering sun
should in the furthest east begin to draw
the shady curtains from Aurora's bed
away from light steals home my heavy son
and private in his chamber pens himself
shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out
and makes himself an artificial night
black and portentous must this humour prove
unless good-counsel may the cause remove

my noble uncle do you know the cause


have you importun'd him by any means

both by myself and many other friends
but he his own affections' counsellor
is to himself I will not say how true
but to himself so secret and so close
so far from sounding and discovery
as is the bud bit with an envious worm
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
or dedicate his beauty to the sun
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
we would as willingly give cure as know

see where he comes so please you step aside
I'll know his grievance or be much denied

I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift Come madam let's away
good morrow cousin

is the day so young

but new struck nine

ay me sad hours seem long
was that my father that went hence so fast

it was What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours

not having that which having makes them short

in love

out

of love


alas that love so gentle in his view
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof

alas that love whose view is muffled still
should without eyes see pathways to his will
where shall we dine O me What fray was here
yet tell me not for I have heard it all
here's much to do with hate but more with love
why then O brawling love O loving hate
O any thing of nothing first create
O heavy lightness serious vanity
mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms
feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
still-waking sleep that is not what it is
this love feel I that feel no love in this
dost thou not laugh

no coz I rather weep
good heart at what

at thy good heart's oppression

why such is love's transgression
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
which thou wilt propagate to have it press'd
with more of thine this love that thou hast shown
doth add more grief to too much of mine own
love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs
being purg'd a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes
being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears
what is it else a madness most discreet
a choking gall and a preserving sweet
farewell my coz


soft I will go along
an if you leave me so you do me wrong
tut I have lost myself I am not here
this is not Romeo he's some other where

tell me in sadness who is that you love

what shall I groan and tell thee

groan why no
but sadly tell me who

bid a sick man in sadness make his will
Ah word ill urg'd to one that is so ill
in sadness cousin I do love a woman

I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd

a right good mark-man And she's fair I love

a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
well in that hit you miss she'll not be hit
with Cupid's arrow she hath Dian's wit
and in strong proof of chastity well arm'd
from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd
she will not stay the siege of loving terms
nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold
O she is rich in beauty only poor
that when she dies with beauty dies her store

then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste

she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
for beauty starv'd with her severity
cuts beauty off from all posterity
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair
to merit bliss by making me despair
she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
do I live dead that live to tell it now
be rul'd by me forget to think of her

O teach me how I should forget to think

by giving liberty unto thine eyes
examine other beauties

'Tis the way
to call hers exquisite in question more
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
being black put us in mind they hide the fair
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
show me a mistress that is passing fair
what doth her beauty serve but as a note
where I may read who pass'd that passing fair
farewell thou canst not teach me to forget

I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt

but Montague is bound as well as I
in penalty alike and tis not hard I think
for men so old as we to keep the peace

of honourable reckoning are you both
and pity tis you liv'd at odds so long
but now my lord what say you to my suit

but saying o'er what I have said before
my child is yet a stranger in the world
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years
let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride

younger than she are happy mothers made

and too soon marr'd are those so early made
earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she
but woo her gentle Paris get her heart
my will to her consent is but a part
an she agree within her scope of choice
lies my consent and fair according voice
this night I hold an old accustom'd feast
whereto I have invited many a guest
such as I love and you among the store
one more most welcome makes my number more
at my poor house look to behold this night
earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light
such comfort as do lusty young men feel
when well-apparel'd April on the heel
of limping winter treads even such delight
among fresh female buds shall you this night
inherit at my house hear all all see
and like her most whose merit most shall be
which on more view of many mine being one
may stand in number though in reckoning none
come go with me
go sirrah trudge about
through fair Verona find those persons out
whose names are written there and to them say
my house and welcome on their pleasure stay


find them out whose names are written here It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ I must to the learned In good time


tut man one fire burns out another's burning
one pain is lessen'd by another's anguish
turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
one desperate grief cures with another's languish
take thou some new infection to thy eye
and the rank poison of the old will die

your plantain leaf is excellent for that

for what I pray thee
for your broken shin

why Romeo art thou mad

not mad but bound more than a madman is
shut up in prison kept without my food
whipp'd and tormented and Good den good fellow

God gi' good den I pray sir can you read

ay mine own fortune in my misery

perhaps you have learn'd it without book but I pray can you read any thing you see

ay if I know the letters and the language

ye say honestly rest you merry


Signior Martino and his wife and daughters County Anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of Vitruvio Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine mine uncle Capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece Rosaline Livia Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena
a fair assembly whither should they come

up

whither

to supper to our house

whose house

my master's

indeed I should have asked you that before

now I'll tell you without asking My master is the great rich Capulet and if you be not of the house of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine Rest you merry


at this same ancient feast of Capulet's
with all the admired beauties of Verona
go thither and with unattainted eye
compare her face with some that I shall show
and I will make thee think thy swan a crow

when the devout religion of mine eye
maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires
and these who often drown'd could never die
transparent heretics be burnt for liars
one fairer than my love the all-seeing sun
ne'er saw her match since first the world begun

tut you saw her fair none else being by
herself pois'd with herself in either eye
but in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
your lady's love against some other maid
that I will show you shining at this feast
and she shall scant show well that now shows best

but to rejoice in splendour of mine own


nurse where's my daughter call her forth to me

now by my maidenhead at twelve year old
I bade her come What lamb what ladybird
God forbid where's this girl what Juliet


how now who calls

your mother

madam I am here
what is your will

this is the matter Nurse give leave awhile
we must talk in secret nurse come back again
thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age

faith I can tell her age unto an hour

she's not fourteen

I'll lay fourteen of my teeth
and yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four
she is not fourteen How long is it now
to Lammas-tide

a fortnight and odd days

even or odd of all days in the year
come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and she God rest all Christian souls
were of an age Well Susan is with God
she was too good for me But as I said
on Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years
and she was wean'd I never shall forget it
of all the days of the year upon that day
for I had then laid wormwood to my dug
sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall
my lord and you were then at Mantua
nay I do bear a brain but as I said
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
'Shake quoth the dove-house twas no need I trow
to bid me trudge
and since that time it is eleven years
for then she could stand high lone nay by the rood
she could have run and waddled all about
for even the day before she broke her brow
and then my husband God be with his soul
a' was a merry man took up the child
'Yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face
wilt thou not Jule and by my halidom
the pretty wretch left crying and said Ay
to see now how a jest shall come about
I warrant an I should live a thousand years
I never should forget it Wilt thou not Jule quoth he
and pretty fool it stinted and said Ay

enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace

yes madam Yet I cannot choose but laugh
to think it should leave crying and say Ay
and yet I warrant it had upon its brow
a bump as big as a young cockerel's stone
a parlous knock and it cried bitterly
'Yea quoth my husband fall'st upon thy face
thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age
wilt thou not Jule it stinted and said Ay

and stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I
peace I have done God mark thee to his grace
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed
an I might live to see thee married once
I have my wish

marry that marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of Tell me daughter Juliet
how stands your disposition to be married

it is an honour that I dream not of

an honour were not I thine only nurse
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat

well think of marriage now younger than you
here in Verona ladies of esteem
are made already mothers by my count
I was your mother much upon these years
that you are now a maid Thus then in brief

a man young lady lady such a man
as all the world why he's a man of wax

Verona's summer hath not such a flower

nay he's a flower in faith a very flower

what say you can you love the gentleman
this night you shall behold him at our feast
read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
and find delight writ there with beauty's pen
examine every married lineament
and see how one another lends content
and what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
find written in the margent of his eyes
this precious book of love this unbound lover
to beautify him only lacks a cover
the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
that book in many eyes doth share the glory
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story
so shall you share all that he doth possess
by having him making yourself no less

no less nay bigger women grow by men

speak briefly can you like of Paris' love

I'll look to like if looking liking move
but no more deep will I endart mine eye
than your consent gives strength to make it fly


madam the guests are come supper served up you called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in the pantry and everything in extremity I must hence to wait I beseech you follow straight

we follow thee Juliet the county stays

go girl seek happy nights to happy days

what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
or shall we on without apology

the date is out of such prolixity
we'll have no Cupid hood-wink'd with a scarf
bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath
scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper
nor no without-book prologue faintly spoke
after the prompter for our entrance
but let them measure us by what they will
we'll measure them a measure and be gone

give me a torch I am not for this ambling
being but heavy I will bear the light

nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance

not I believe me you have dancing shoes
so stakes me to the ground I cannot move

you are a lover borrow Cupid's wings
and soar with them above a common bound

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his light feathers and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
under love's heavy burden do I sink

and to sink in it should you burden love
too great oppression for a tender thing

is love a tender thing it is too rough
too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn

if love be rough with you be rough with love
prick love for pricking and you beat love down
give me a case to put my visage in
a visor for a visor what care I
what curious eye doth quote deformities
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me

come knock and enter and no sooner in
but every man betake him to his legs

a torch for me let wantons light of heart
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
for I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase
I'll be a candle holder and look on
the game was ne'er so fair and I am done

tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word
if thou art Dun we'll draw thee from the mire
of save your reverence love wherein thou stick'st
up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho

nay that's not so
I mean sir in delay
we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
take our good meaning for our judgment sits
five times in that ere once in our five wits

and we mean well in going to this masque
but tis no wit to go

why may one ask

I dream'd a dream to-night

and so did I

well what was yours

that dreamers often lie

in bed asleep while they do dream things true
O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you

queen Mab What's she

she is the fairies' midwife and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agate-stone
on the fore-finger of an alderman
drawn with a team of little atomies
athwart men's noses as they lie asleep
her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs
the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
the traces of the smallest spider's web
the collars of the moonshine's watery beams
her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film
her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat
not half so big as a round little worm
prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid
her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
and in this state she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains and then they dream of love
o'er courtiers' knees that dream on curtsies straight
o'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees
o'er ladies' lips who straight on kisses dream
which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
and sometimes comes she with a tithe pig's tail
tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep
then dreams he of another benefice
sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish bladed
of healths five fathom deep and then anon
drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
and sleeps again This is that very Mab
and bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs
which once untangled much misfortune bodes
this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
that presses them and learns them first to bear
making them women of good carriage
this is she

peace peace Mercutio peace
thou talk'st of nothing

true I talk of dreams
which are the children of an idle brain
begot of nothing but vain fantasy
which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind who woos
even now the frozen bosom of the north
and being anger'd puffs away from thence
turning his face to the dew-dropping south

supper is done and we shall come too late

I fear too early for my mind misgives
some consequence yet hanging in the stars
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels and expire the term
of a despised life clos'd in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely death
but he that hath the steerage of my course
direct my sail On lusty gentlemen

strike drum


where's Potpan that he helps not to take away he shift a trencher he scrape a trencher

when good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands and they unwashed too tis a foul thing

away with the joint-stools remove the court-cupboard look to the plate Good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell Antony and Potpan
ay boy ready

you are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber

we cannot be here and there too

cheerly boys be brisk awhile and the longer liver take all

welcome gentlemen ladies that have their toes
unplagu'd with corns will walk a bout with you
Ah ha my mistresses which of you all
will now deny to dance she that makes dainty she
I'll swear hath corns am I come near ye now
welcome gentlemen I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor and could tell
a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
such as would please tis gone tis gone tis gone
you are welcome gentlemen Come musicians play
a hall a hall give room and foot it girls
more light ye knaves and turn the tables up
and quench the fire the room has grown too hot
Ah sirrah this unlook'd-for sport comes well
nay sit nay sit good cousin Capulet
for you and I are past our dancing days
how long is t now since last yourself and I
were in a mask

by'r Lady thirty years

what man tis not so much tis not so much
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio
come Pentecost as quickly as it will
some five and twenty years and then we mask'd

'Tis more tis more his son is older sir
his son is thirty

will you tell me that

what lady is that which doth enrich the hand
of yonder knight

I know not sir

O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear
beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows
the measure done I'll watch her place of stand
and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
did my heart love till now forswear it sight
for I ne'er saw true beauty till this night

this by his voice should be a Montague
fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
now by the stock and honour of my kin
to strike him dead I hold it not a sin

why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so

uncle this is a Montague our foe
a villain that is hither come in spite
to scorn at our solemnity this night

young Romeo is it

'Tis he that villain Romeo

content thee gentle coz let him alone
he bears him like a portly gentleman
and to say truth Verona brags of him
to be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth
I would not for the wealth of all this town
therefore be patient take no note of him
it is my will the which if thou respect
show a fair presence and put off these frowns
an ill-beseeming semblance for a feast

it fits when such a villain is a guest
I'll not endure him

he shall be endur'd
what goodman boy I say he shall go to
am I the master here or you go to
you'll not endure him God shall mend my soul
you'll make a mutiny among my guests
you will set cock-a-hoop you'll be the man

why uncle tis a shame

go to go to
you are a saucy boy is't so indeed
you must contrary me marry tis time
well said my hearts You are a princox go
be quiet or More light more light For shame
I'll make you quiet What cheerly my hearts

patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
I will withdraw but this intrusion shall
now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall


if I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine the gentle sin is this
my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
to smooth that rough touch with a tenderkiss

good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
which mannerly devotion shows in this
for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch

have not saints lips and holy palmers too

ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer

O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair

saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake

then move not while my prayers' effect I take
thus from my lips by thine my sin is purg'd


then have my lips the sin that they have took

sin from my lips O trespass sweetly urg'd
give me my sin again


madam your mother craves a word with you

what is her mother

marry bachelor
her mother is the lady of the house
and a good lady and a wise and virtuous
I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal
I tell you he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks

is she a Capulet
O dear account my life is my foe's debt

away be gone the sport is at the best

ay so I fear the more is my unrest

we have a trifling foolish banquet towards
is it e'en so Why then I thank you all
I thank you honest gentlemen good-night
more torches here Come on then let's to bed
Ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late
I'll to my rest


come hither nurse What is yond gentleman

the son and heir of old Tiberio

what's he that now is going out of door

marry that I think be young Petruchio

what's he that follows there that would not dance

I know not
go ask his name If he be married
my grave is like to be my wedding bed

his name is Romeo and a Montague
the only son of your great enemy

my only love sprung from my only hate
too early seen unknown and known too late
prodigious birth of love it is to me
that I must love a loathed enemy

what's this what's this

a rime I learn'd even now
of one I danc'd withal


anon anon
come let's away the strangers are all gone
now old desire doth in his death-bed lie
and young affection gapes to be his heir
that fair for which love groan'd for and would die
with tender Juliet match'd is now not fair
now Romeo is belov'd and loves again
alike bewitched by the charm of looks
but to his foe suppos'd he must complain
and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks
being held a foe he may not have access
to breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear
and she as much in love her means much less
to meet her new-beloved any where
but passion lends them power time means to meet
tempering extremity with extreme sweet

can I go forward when my heart is here
turn back dull earth and find thy centre out

Romeo my cousin Romeo
he is wise
and on my life hath stol'n him home to bed

he ran this way and leap'd this orchard wall
call good Mercutio

nay I'll conjure too
Romeo humours madman passion lover
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
speak but one rime and I am satisfied
cry but Ay me couple but love' and dove
speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
one nickname for her purblind son and heir
young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim
when King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid
he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
the ape is dead and I must conjure him
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie
that in thy likeness thou appear to us

an if he hear thee thou wilt anger him

this cannot anger him twould anger him
to raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
of some strange nature letting it there stand
till she had laid it and conjur'd it down
that were some spite my invocation
is fair and honest and in his mistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him

come he hath hid himself among these trees
to be consorted with the humorous night
blind is his love and best befits the dark

if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
now will he sit under a medlar tree
as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
O Romeo that she were O that she were
an open et c tera thou a poperin pear
Romeo good night I'll to my truckle-bed
this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep
come shall we go

go then for tis in vain
to seek him here that means not to be found


he jests at scars that never felt a wound

but soft what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and Juliet is the sun
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
who is already sick and pale with grief
that thou her maid art far more fair than she
be not her maid since she is envious
and none but fools do wear it cast it off
it is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
she speaks yet she says nothing what of that
her eye discourses I will answer it
I am too bold tis not to me she speaks
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
having some business do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return
what if her eyes were there they in her head
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and think it were not night
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand
that I might touch that cheek

ay me
she speaks
O speak again bright angel for thou art
as glorious to this night being o'er my head
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air

O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
and I'll no longer be a Capulet

shall I hear more or shall I speak at this

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy
thou art thyself though not a Montague
what's Montague it is nor hand nor foot
belonging to a man O be some other name
what's in a name that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet
so Romeo would were he not Romeo call'd
retain that dear perfection which he owes
without that title Romeo doff thy name
and for that name which is no part of thee
take all myself

I take thee at thy word
call me but love and I'll be new baptiz'd
henceforth I never will be Romeo

what man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
so stumblest on my counsel

by a name
I know not how to tall thee who I am
my name dear saint is hateful to myself
had I it written I would tear the word

my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
of that tongue's uttering yet I know the sound
art thou not Romeo and a Montague

neither fair maid if either thee dislike

how cam'st thou hither tell me and wherefore
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
and the place death considering who thou art
if any of my kinsmen find thee here

with love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls
for stony limits cannot hold love out
and what love can do that dares love attempt
therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me

if they do see thee they will murder thee
alack there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
and I am proof against their enmity

I would not for the world they saw thee here

I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes
and but thou love me let them find me here
my life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued wanting of thy love

by whose direction found'st thou out this place

by Love that first did prompt me to inquire
he lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea
I would adventure for such merchandise

else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
what I have spoke but farewell compliment
dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay
and I will take thy word yet if thou swear'st
thou mayst prove false at lovers' perjuries
they say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
or if thou think'st I am too quickly won
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay
so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
in truth fair Montague I am too fond
and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
but trust me gentleman I'll prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange
I should have been more strange I must confess
but that thou over-heard'st ere I was ware
my true love's passion therefore pardon me
which the dark night hath so discovered

lady by yonder blessed moon I swear
that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops

O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
that monthly changes in her circled orb
lest that thy love prove likewise variable

what shall I swear by

do not swear at all
or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry
and I'll believe thee

if my heart's dear love

well do not swear Although I joy in thee
it is too rash too unadvis'd too sudden
too like the lightning which doth cease to be
ere one can say it lightens Sweet good-night
this bud of love by summer's ripening breath
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
good-night good-night as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast

O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied

what satisfaction canst thou have to-night

the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
and yet I would it were to give again

wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love

and yet I wish but for the thing I have
my bounty is as boundless as the sea
my love as deep the more I give to thee
the more I have for both are infinite

I hear some noise within dear love adieu
anon good nurse Sweet Montague be true
stay but a little I will come again


O blessed blessed night I am afeard
being in night all this is but a dream
too flattering-sweet to be substantial


three words dear Romeo and good-night indeed
if that thy bent of love be honourable
thy purpose marriage send me word to-morrow
by one that I'll procure to come to thee
and all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
and follow thee my lord throughout the world

madam

I come anon But if thou mean'st not well
I do beseech thee

madam

by and by I come
to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
to-morrow will I send

so thrive my soul

a thousand times good-night


love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books
but love from love toward school with heavy looks

hist Romeo hist O for a falconer's voice
to lure this tassel-gentle back again
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
with repetition of my Romeo's name

it is my soul that calls upon my name
how silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night
like softest music to attending ears

Romeo

my dear

at what o'clock to-morrow

at the hour of nine

I will not fail tis twenty years till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back

let me stand here till thou remember it

I shall forget to have thee still stand there
remembering how I love thy company

and I'll still stay to have thee still forget
forgetting any other home but this

'Tis almost morning I would have thee gone
and yet no further than a wanton's bird
who lets it hop a little from her hand
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
and with a silk thread plucks it back again

I would I were thy bird

sweet so would I
yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
good-night good-night parting is such sweet sorrow
that I shall say good-night till it be morrow


sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
hence will I to my ghostly father's cell
his help to crave and my dear hap to tell


the grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
from forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels
the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers
the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb
what is her burying grave that is her womb
and from her womb children of divers kind
we sucking on her natural bosom find
many for many virtues excellent
none but for some and yet all different
O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
in herbs plants stones and their true qualities
for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
but to the earth some special good doth give
nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
and vice sometime's by action dignified
within the infant rind of this weak flower
poison hath residence and medicine power
being tasted slays all senses with the heart
two such opposed foes encamp them still
in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
and where the worser is predominant
full soon the canker death eats up that plant


good morrow father

Benedicite
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
young son it argues a distemper'd head
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
care keeps his watch in every old man's eye
and where care lodges sleep will never lie
but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art up-rous'd by some distemperature
our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night

that last is true the sweeter rest was mine

God pardon sin wast thou with Rosaline

with Rosaline my ghostly father no
I have forgot that name and that name's woe

that's my good son but where hast thou been then

I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
I have been feasting with mine enemy
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
that's by me wounded both our remedies
within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
my intercession likewise steads my foe

riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
on the fair daughter of rich Capulet
as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
and all combin'd save what thou must combine
by holy marriage when and where and how
we met we woo'd and made exchange of vow
I'll tell thee as we pass but this I pray
that thou consent to marry us to-day

holy Saint Francis what a change is here
is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
so soon forsaken young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
Jesu Maria what a deal of brine
hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
how much salt water thrown away in waste
to season love that of it doth not taste
thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet
if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine
thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
and art thou chang'd pronounce this sentence then
women may fall when there's no strength in men

thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline

for doting not for loving pupil mine

and bad'st me bury love

not in a grave
to lay one in another out to have

I pray thee chide not she whom I love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow

O she knew well
thy love did read by rote and could not spell
but come young waverer come go with me
in one respect I'll thy assistant be
for this alliance may so happy prove
to turn your households' rancour to pure love

O let us hence I stand on sudden haste

wisely and slow they stumble that run fast


where the devil should this Romeo be
came he not home to-night

not to his father's I spoke with his man

why that same pale hard-hearted wench that Rosaline

Tybalt the kinsman of old Capulet
hath sent a letter to his father's house

a challenge on my life

Romeo will answer it

any man that can write may answer a letter

nay he will answer the letter's master how he dares being dared

alas poor Romeo he is already dead stabbed with a white wench's black eye shot through the ear with a love-song the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft and is he a man to encounter Tybalt

why what is Tybalt

more than prince of cats I can tell you O he is the courageous captain of compliments He fights as you sing prick-song keeps time distance and proportion rests me his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause Ah the immortal passado the punto reverso the hay

the what
the pox of such antick lisping affecting fantasticoes these new tuners of accents By Jesu a very good blade a very tall man a very good whore Why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies these fashion-mongers these pardonnez-mois who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench O their bons their bons


here comes Romeo here comes Romeo

without his roe like a dried herring O flesh flesh how art thou fishified Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench marry she had a better love to be-rime her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gipsy Helen and Hero hildings and harlots Thisbe a grey eye or so but not to the purpose Signior Romeo bon jour there's a French salutation to your French slop You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night

good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you

the slip sir the slip can you not conceive

pardon good Mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy

that's as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams

meaning to curtsy

thou hast most kindly hit it


nay I am the very pink of courtesy

pink for flower

right

why then is my pump well flowered

well said follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out the pump that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular

O single-soled jest solely singular for the singleness

come between us good Benvolio my wit faints

switch and spurs switch and spurs or I'll cry a match

nay if thy wits run the wild-goose chase I have done for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five Was I with you there for the goose


I will bite thee by the ear for that jest

nay good goose bite not

thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce

and is it not then well served in to a sweet goose

O here's a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad

I stretch it out for that word broad which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose

why is not this better now than groaning for love now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole

stop there stop there

thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair


O thou art deceived I would have made it short for I was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer

here's goodly gear


a sail a sail

two two a shirt and a smock

Peter

anon

my fan Peter

good Peter to hide her face for her fan's the fairer face

God ye good morrow gentlemen
God ye good den fair gentlewoman

is it good den

'Tis no less I tell you for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon

out upon you what a man are you

one gentlewoman that God hath made for himself to mar

by my troth it is well said for himself to mar quoth a' Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo

I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him I am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse

you say well

yea is the worst well very well took i' faith wisely wisely

if you be he sir I desire some confidence with you
she will indite him to some supper

a bawd a bawd a bawd So ho

what hast thou found

no hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent


an old hare hoar and an old hare hoar
is very good meat in Lent
but a hare that is hoar is too much for a score
when it hoars ere it be spent

Romeo will you come to your father's we'll to dinner thither

I will follow you

farewell ancient lady farewell Lady lady lady

marry farewell I pray you sir what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery

a gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month

an a' speak anything against me I'll take him down an a' were lustier than he is and twenty such Jacks and if I cannot I'll find those that shall Scurvy knave I am none of his flirt-gills I am none of his skeins-mates

and thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure

I saw no man use you at his pleasure if I had my weapon should quickly have been out I warrant you I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side

now afore God I am so vexed that every part about me quivers Scurvy knave Pray you sir a word and as I told you my young lady bade me inquire you out what she bid me say I will keep to myself but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behaviour as they say for the gentlewoman is young and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing

nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress I protest unto thee

good heart and i' faith I will tell her as much Lord Lord she will be a joyful woman

what wilt thou tell her nurse thou dost not mark me


bid her devise
some means to come to shrift this afternoon
and there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
be shriv'd and married Here is for thy pains

no truly sir not a penny

go to I say you shall

this afternoon sir well she shall be there

and stay good nurse behind the abbey wall
within this hour my man shall be with thee
and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair
which to the high top-gallant of my joy
must be my convoy in the secret night
farewell Be trusty and I'll quit thy pains
farewell Commend me to thy mistress
now God in heaven bless thee Hark you sir

what sayst thou my dear nurse

is your man secret Did you ne'er hear say
two may keep counsel putting one away

I warrant thee my man's as true as steel

well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady Lord Lord when twas a little prating thing O there's a nobleman in town one Paris that would fain lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lief see a toad a very toad as see him I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man but I'll warrant you when I say so she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter

ay nurse what of that both with an R

Ah mocker that's the dog's name R is for the No I know it begins with some other letter and she had the prettiest sententious of it of you and rosemary that it would do you good to hear it

commend me to thy lady

ay a thousand times


anon

before and apace


the clock struck nine when I did send the nurse
in half an hour she promis'd to return
perchance she cannot meet him that's not so
O she is lame love's heralds should be thoughts
which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
driving back shadows over lowering hills
therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love
and therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings
now is the sun upon the highmost hill
of this day's journey and from nine till twelve
is three long hours yet she is not come
had she affections and warm youthful blood
she'd be as swift in motion as a ball
and his to me
but old folks many feign as they were dead
unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead


O God she comes O honey nurse what news

hast thou met with him Send thy man away

Peter stay at the gate


now good sweet nurse O Lord why look'st thou sad
though news be sad yet tell them merrily
if good thou sham'st the music of sweet news
by playing it to me with so sour a face

I am aweary give me leave awhile
fie how my bones ache What a jaunce have I had
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
nay come I pray thee speak good good nurse speak

Jesu what haste can you not stay awhile
do you not see that I am out of breath

how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
to say to me that thou art out of breath
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay
is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
is thy news good or bad answer to that
say either and I'll stay the circumstance
let me be satisfied is t good or bad

well you have made a simple choice you know not how to choose a man Romeo no not he though his face be better than any man's yet his leg excels all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body though they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare He is not the flower of courtesy but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb Go thy ways wench serve God What have you dined at home

no no but all this did I know before
what says he of our marriage what of that

it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
my back o' t'other side O my back my back
beshrew your heart for sending me about
to catch my death with jauncing up and down

i' faith I am sorry that thou art not well
sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love

your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and I warrant a virtuous Where is your mother

where is my mother why she is within
where should she be How oddly thou repliest
'Your love says like an honest gentleman
where is your mother

O God's lady dear
are you so hot Marry come up I trow
is this the poultice for my aching bones
henceforward do your messages yourself
here's such a coil come what says Romeo

have you got leave to go to shrift to-day

I have

then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell
there stays a husband to make you a wife
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
they'll be in scarlet straight at any news
hie you to church I must another way
to fetch a ladder by the which your love
must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark
I am the drudge and toil in your delight
but you shall bear the burden soon at night
go I'll to dinner hie you to the cell

hie to high fortune Honest nurse farewell

so smile the heaven upon this holy act
that after hours with sorrow chide us not

amen amen but come what sorrow can
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
that one short minute gives me in her sight
do thou but close our hands with holy words
then love-devouring death do what he dare
it is enough I may but call her mine

these violent delights have violent ends
and in their triumph die like fire and powder
which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
is loathsome in his own deliciousness
and in the taste confounds the appetite
therefore love moderately long love doth so
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow


will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint
a lover may bestride the gossamer
that idles in the wanton summer air

and yet not fall so light is vanity

good even to my ghostly confessor

Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both

as much to him else are his thanks too much

Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbour air and let rich music's tongue
unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
receive in either by this dear encounter

brags of his substance not of ornament
they are but beggars that can count their worth
but my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth

come come with me and we will make short work
for by your leaves you shall not stay alone
till holy church incorporate two in one


I pray thee good Mercutio let's retire
the day is hot the Capulets abroad
and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring

thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says God send me no need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need

am I like such a fellow


and what to

nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other Thou why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter with another for tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling

an I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter

the fee-simple O simple

by my head here come the Capulets

by my heel I care not


follow me close for I will speak to them Gentlemen good den a word with one of you

and but one word with one of us Couple it with something make it a word and a blow

you shall find me apt enough to that sir an you will give me occasion
could you not take some occasion without giving

Mercutio thou consort'st with Romeo

consort What dost thou make us minstrels an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords here's my fiddlestick here's that shall make you dance Zounds consort

we talk here in the public haunt of men
either withdraw unto some private place
or reason coldly of your grievances
or else depart here all eyes gaze on us

men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze
I will not budge for no man's pleasure I


well peace be with you sir Here comes my man

but I'll be hang'd sir if he wear your livery
marry go before to field he'll be your follower

Romeo the hate I bear thee can afford
no better term than this thou art a villain

Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee
doth much excuse the appertaining rage
to such a greeting villain am I none
therefore farewell I see thou know'st me not

boy this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw

I do protest I never injur'd thee
but love thee better than thou canst devise
till thou shalt know the reason of my love
and so good Capulet which name I tender
as dearly as my own be satisfied

O calm dishonourable vile submission

Tybalt you rat-catcher will you walk

what wouldst thou have with me

good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives that I mean to make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter dry-beat the rest of the eight Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out

I am for you

gentle Mercutio put thy rapier up

come sir your passado


draw Benvolio beat down their weapons
gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage
Tybalt Mercutio the prince expressly hath
forbidden bandying in Verona streets
hold Tybalt good Mercutio

I am hurt
a plague o' both your houses I am sped
is he gone and hath nothing

what art thou hurt

ay ay a scratch a scratch marry tis enough
where is my page Go villain fetch a surgeon


courage man the hurt cannot be much

no tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but tis enough twill serve ask for me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man I am peppered I warrant for this world A plague o' both your houses Zounds a dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic Why the devil came you between us I was hurt under your arm

I thought all for the best

help me into some house Benvolio
or I shall faint A plague o' both your houses
and soundly too your houses


this gentleman the prince's near ally
my very friend hath got his mortal hurt
in my behalf my reputation stain'd
with Tybalt's slander Tybalt that an hour
hath been my kinsman O sweet Juliet
thy beauty hath made me effeminate
and in my temper soften'd valour's steel


O Romeo Romeo brave Mercutio's dead
that gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds
which too untimely here did scorn the earth

this day's black fate on more days doth depend
this but begins the woe others must end

here comes the furious Tybalt back again

alive in triumph and Mercutio slain
away to heaven respective lenity
and fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now
now Tybalt take the villain back again
that late thou gav'st me for Mercutio's soul
is but a little way above our heads
staying for thine to keep him company
either thou or I or both must go with him

thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
shalt with him hence

this shall determine that


Romeo away be gone
the citizens are up and Tybalt slain
if thou art taken hence be gone away

O I am Fortune's fool

why dost thou stay

which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio
Tybalt that murderer which way ran he

there lies that Tybalt

up sir go with me
I charge thee in the prince's name obey


where are the vile beginners of this fray

O noble prince I can discover all
the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
that slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio

Tybalt my cousin O my brother's child
O prince O cousin husband O the blood is spill'd
of my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true
for blood of ours shed blood of Montague
O cousin cousin

Benvolio who began this bloody fray

Tybalt here slain whom Romeo's hand did slay
Romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
how nice the quarrel was and urg'd withal
your high displeasure all this uttered
with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow'd
could not take truce with the unruly spleen
of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
with piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast
who all as hot turns deadly point to point
cold death aside and with the other sends
it back to Tybalt whose dexterity
retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
'Hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue
his agile arm beats down their fatal points
and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
an envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
but by and by comes back to Romeo
who had but newly entertain'd revenge
and to t they go like lightning for ere I
could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
and as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
this is the truth or let Benvolio die

he is a kinsman to the Montague
affection makes him false he speaks not true
some twenty of them fought in this black strife
and all those twenty could but kill one life
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live

Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe

not Romeo prince he was Mercutio's friend
his fault concludes but what the law should end
the life of Tybalt

and for that offence
immediately we do exile him hence
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding
my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding
but I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
that you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
therefore use none let Romeo hence in haste
else when he's found that hour is his last
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill


gallop apace you fiery-footed steeds
towards Ph bus' lodging such a waggoner
as Ph thon would whip you to the west
and bring in cloudy night immediately
spread thy close curtain love-performing night
that runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen
lovers can see to do their amorous rites
by their own beauties or if love be blind
it best agrees with night Come civil night
thou sober-suited matron all in black
and learn me how to lose a winning match
play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks
with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
think true love acted simple modesty
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow on a raven's back
come gentle night come loving black-brow'd night
give me my Romeo and when he shall die
take him and cut him out in little stars
and he will make the face of heaven so fine
that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love
but not possess'd it and though I am sold
not yet enjoy'd So tedious is this day
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child that hath new robes
and may not wear them O here comes my nurse


and she brings news and every tongue that speaks
but Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence
now nurse what news What hast thou there the cords
that Romeo bade thee fetch

ay ay the cords


Ah me what news why dost thou wring thy hands

Ah well-a-day he's dead he's dead he's dead
we are undone lady we are undone
alack the day he's gone he's killed he's dead

can heaven be so envious

Romeo can
though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo
who ever would have thought it Romeo

what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell
and that bare vowel I shall poison more
than the death-darting eye of cockatrice
I am not I if there be such an I
or those eyes shut that make thee answer I
if he be slain say I or if not no
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe

I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes
God save the mark here on his manly breast
a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
pale pale as ashes all bedaub'd in blood
all in gore blood I swounded at the sight

O break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
to prison eyes ne'er look on liberty
vile earth to earth resign end motion here
and thou and Romeo press one heavy bier

O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
that ever I should live to see thee dead

what storm is this that blows so contrary
is Romeo slaughter'd and is Tybalt dead
my dearest cousin and my dearer lord
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
for who is living if those two are gone

Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
Romeo that kill'd him he is banished

O God did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood

it did it did alas the day it did

O serpent heart hid with a flowering face
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
dove-feather'd raven wolvish-ravening lamb
just opposite to what thou justly seem'st
a damned saint an honourable villain
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
was ever book containing such vile matter
so fairly bound O that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace

there's no trust
no faith no honesty in men all naught
all perjur'd all dissemblers all forsworn
Ah where's my man give me some aqua vit
these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
shame come to Romeo

blister'd be thy tongue
for such a wish he was not born to shame
upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit
sole monarch of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to chide at him

will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin

shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
when I thy three-hours wife have mangled it
but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband
back foolish tears back to your native spring
your tributary drops belong to woe
which you mistaking offer up to joy
my husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
and Tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband
all this is comfort wherefore weep I then
some word there was worser than Tybalt's death
that murder'd me I would forget it fain
but O it presses to my memory
'Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished
that banished that one word banished
hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalt's death
was woe enough if it had ended there
or if sour woe delights in fellowship
and needly will be rank'd with other griefs
why follow'd not when she said Tybalt's dead
thy father or thy mother nay or both
which modern lamentation might have mov'd
but with a rearward following Tybalt's death
'Romeo is banished to speak that word
is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
all slain all dead Romeo is banished
there is no end no limit measure bound
in that word's death no words can that woe sound
where is my father and my mother nurse

weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse
will you go to them I will bring you thither
wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent
when theirs are dry for Romeo's banishment
take up those cords Poor ropes you are beguil'd
both you and I for Romeo is exil'd
he made you for a highway to my bed
but I a maid die maiden-widowed
come cords come nurse I'll to my wedding bed
and death not Romeo take my maidenhead

hie to your chamber I'll find Romeo
to comfort you I wot well where he is
hark ye your Romeo will be here to-night
I'll to him he is hid at Laurence' cell

O find him give this ring to my true knight
and bid him come to take his last farewell


Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
and thou art wedded to calamity


father what news what is the prince's doom
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
that I yet know not

too familiar
is my dear son with such sour company
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom

what less than doomsday is the prince's doom

a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips
not body's death but body's banishment

ha banishment be merciful say death
for exile hath more terror in his look
much more than death do not say banishment
hence from Verona art thou banished
be patient for the world is broad and wide

there is no world without Verona walls
but purgatory torture hell itself
hence banished is banish'd from the world
and world's exile is death then banished
is death mis-term'd Calling death banished
thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe
and smil'st upon the stroke that murders me

O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness
thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
taking thy part hath rush'd aside the law
and turn'd that black word death to banishment
this is dear mercy and thou seest it not

'Tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
where Juliet lives and every cat and dog
live here in heaven and may look on her
but Romeo may not more validity
more honourable state more courtship lives
in carrion flies than Romeo they may seize
on the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
and steal immortal blessing from her lips
who even in pure and vestal modesty
still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
flies may do this but I from this must fly
they are free men but I am banished
and sayst thou yet that exile is not death
hadst thou no poison mix'd no sharp-ground knife
no sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean
but banished' to kill me Banished
O friar the damned use that word in hell
howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
being a divine a ghostly confessor
a sin-absolver and my friend profess'd
to mangle me with that word banished
thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word

O thou wilt speak again of banishment

I'll give thee armour to keep off that word
adversity's sweet milk philosophy
to comfort thee though thou art banished

yet banished Hang up philosophy
unless philosophy can make a Juliet
displant a town reverse a prince's doom
it helps not it prevails not talk no more

O then I see that madmen have no ears

how should they when that wise men have no eyes

let me dispute with thee of thy estate

wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love
an hour but married Tybalt murdered
doting like me and like me banished
then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
and fall upon the ground as I do now
taking the measure of an unmade grave


arise one knocks good Romeo hide thyself

not I unless the breath of heart-sick groans
mist-like infold me from the search of eyes


hark how they knock Who's there Romeo arise
thou wilt be taken Stay awhile Stand up

run to my study By and by God's will
what wilfulness is this I come I come
who knocks so hard whence come you what's your will

let me come in and you shall know my errand
I come from Lady Juliet

welcome then


O holy friar O tell me holy friar
where is my lady's lord where's Romeo

there on the ground with his own tears made drunk

O he is even in my mistress' case
just in her case

O woeful sympathy
piteous predicament Even so lies she
blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
for Juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand
why should you fall into so deep an O

nurse

Ah sir ah sir Well death's the end of all

spak'st thou of Juliet how is it with her
doth she not think me an old murderer
now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
with blood remov'd but little from her own
where is she and how doth she and what says
my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love

O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
and now falls on her bed and then starts up
and Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
and then down falls again

shot from the deadly level of a gun
did murder her as that name's cursed hand
murder'd her kinsman O tell me friar tell me
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge tell me that I may sack
the hateful mansion


hold thy desperate hand
art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast
unseemly woman in a seeming man
or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both
thou hast amaz'd me by my holy order
I thought thy disposition better temper'd
hast thou slain Tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
and slay thy lady that in thy life lives
by doing damned hate upon thyself
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
in thes at once which thou at once wouldst lose
fie fie thou sham'st thy shape thy love thy wit
which like a usurer abound'st in all
and usest none in that true use indeed
which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
thy noble shape is but a form of wax
digressing from the valour of a man
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish
thy wit that ornament to shape and love
misshapen in the conduct of them both
like powder in a skilless soldier's flask
to set a-fire by thine own ignorance
and thou dismember'd with thine own defence
what rouse thee man thy Juliet is alive
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
there art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
but thou slew'st Tybalt there art thou happy too
and turns it to exile there art thou happy
a pack of blessings light upon thy back
happiness courts thee in her best array
but like a misbehav'd and sullen wench
thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love
take heed take heed for such die miserable
go get thee to thy love as was decreed
ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
but look thou stay not till the watch be set
for then thou canst not pass to Mantua
where thou shalt live till we can find a time
to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
than thou went'st forth in lamentation
go before nurse commend me to thy lady
and bid her hasten all the house to bed
which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could have stay'd here all the night
to hear good counsel O what learning is
my lord I'll tell my lady you will come

do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide

here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
hie you make haste for it grows very late


how well my comfort is reviv'd by this

go hence good-night and here stands all your state
either be gone before the watch be set
or by the break of day disguis'd from hence
sojourn in Mantua I'll find out your man
and he shall signify from time to time
every good hap to you that chances here
give me thy hand tis late farewell goodnight
but that a joy past joy calls out on me
it were a grief so brief to part with thee
farewell


things have fall'n out sir so unluckily
that we have had no time to move our daughter
look you she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly
and so did I well we were born to die
'Tis very late she'll not come down to night
I promise you but for your company
I would have been a-bed an hour ago

these times of woe afford no time to woo
madam good-night commend me to your daughter

I will and know her mind early to-morrow
to-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness

of my child's love I think she will be rul'd
in all respects by me nay more I doubt it not
wife go you to her ere you go to bed
acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
and bid her mark you me on Wednesday next
but soft what day is this

Monday my lord

Monday ha ha Well Wednesday is too soon
o' Thursday let it be o' Thursday tell her
she shall be married to this noble earl
will you be ready do you like this haste
we'll keep no great ado a friend or two
for hark you Tybalt being slain so late
it may be thought we held him carelessly
being our kinsman if we revel much
therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends
and there an end But what say you to Thursday
my lord I would that Thursday were to-morrow

well get you gone o' Thursday be it then
go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
prepare her wife against this wedding-day
farewell my lord Light to my chamber ho
afore me it is so very very late
that we may call it early by and by
good-night


wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
it was the nightingale and not the lark
that pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear
nightly she sings on you pomegranate tree
believe me love it was the nightingale

it was the lark the herald of the morn
no nightingale look love what envious streaks
night's candles are burnt out and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I must be gone and live or stay and die

yon light is not daylight I know it I
it is some meteor that the sun exhales
to be to thee this night a torch-bearer
and light thee on thy way to Mantua
therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone

let me be ta'en let me be put to death
I am content so thou wilt have it so
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
the vaulty heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
how is't my soul let's talk it is not day
it is it is hie hence be gone away
it is the lark that sings so out of tune
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
some say the lark makes sweet division
this doth not so for she divideth us
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
O now I would they had chang'd voices too
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
hunting thee hence with hunts-up to the day
O now be gone more light and light it grows

more light and light more dark and dark our woes


madam

nurse

your lady mother is coming to your chamber


then window let day in and let life out

farewell farewell one kiss and I'll descend


art thou gone so my lord my love my friend
I must hear from thee every day in the hour
for in a minute there are many days
O by this count I shall be much in years
ere I again behold my Romeo

farewell
I will omit no opportunity
that may convey my greetings love to thee

O think'st thou we shall ever meet again

for sweet discourses in our time to come

O God I have an ill-divining soul
methinks I see thee now thou art so low
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb
either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale

and trust me love in my eye so do you
dry sorrow drinks our blood Adieu adieu


O fortune fortune all men call thee fickle
if thou art fickle what dost thou with him
that is renown'd for faith Be fickle fortune
for then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
but send him back

ho daughter are you up

is she not down so late or up so early
what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither


why how now Juliet

madam I am not well

evermore weeping for your cousin's death
what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
and if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
therefore have done some grief shows much of love
but much of grief shows still some want of wit

yet let me weep for such a feeling loss

so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
which you weep for

I cannot choose but ever weep the friend

well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death
as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him

what villain madam

that same villain Romeo

villain and he be many miles asunder
God pardon him I do with all my heart
and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart

that is because the traitor murderer lives

ay madam from the reach of these my hands
would none but I might venge my cousin's death

we will have vengeance for it fear thou not
where that same banish'd runsgate doth live
shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
that he shall soon keep Tybalt company
and then I hope thou wilt be satisfied

indeed I never shall be satisfied
with Romeo till I behold him dead
is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd
madam if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison I would temper it
that Romeo should upon receipt thereof
soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
to hear him nam'd and cannot come to him
to wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
upon his body that hath slaughter'd him

find thou the means and I'll find such a man
but now I'll tell thee joyful tidings girl

what are they I beseech your ladyship

well well thou hast a careful father child
one who to put thee from thy heaviness
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
that thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for

madam in happy time what day is that

marry my child early next Thursday morn
the gallant young and noble gentleman
the County Paris at Saint Peter's church
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride

now by Saint Peter's church and Peter too
he shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed
ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam
it shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
rather than Paris These are news indeed

here comes your father tell him so yourself
and see how he will take it at your hands


when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
but for the sunset of my brother's son
it rains downright
how now a conduit girl what still in tears
evermore showering In one little body
thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind
for still thy eyes which I may call the sea
do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
who raging with thy tears and they with them
without a sudden calm will overset
thy tempest-tossed body How now wife

ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
I would the fool were married to her grave

soft take me with you take me with you wife
how will she none doth she not give us thanks
is she not proud doth she not count her bless'd
unworthy as she is that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom

not proud you have but thankful that you have
proud can I never be of what I hate
but thankful even for hate that is meant love

how now how now chop-logic What is this
'Proud and I thank you and I thank you not
and yet not proud mistress minion you
thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
but fettle your fine joints gainst Thursday next
or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither
out you green-sickness carrion out you baggage
you tallow face

fie fie what are you mad

good father I beseech you on my knees
hear me with patience but to speak a word

hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
I tell thee what get thee to church o' Thursday
or never after look me in the face
speak not reply not do not answer me
my fingers itch Wife we scarce thought us bless'd
that God had lent us but this only child
but now I see this one is one too much
and that we have a curse in having her
out on her hilding

you are to blame my lord to rate her so

and why my lady wisdom hold your tongue
good prudence smatter with your gossips go

I speak no treason

O God ye good den

may not one speak

peace you mumbling fool
utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl
for here we need it not

you are too hot

God's bread it makes me mad
day night hour tide time work play
to have her match'd and having now provided
a gentleman of noble parentage
of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train'd
stuff'd as they say with honourable parts
proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man
and then to have a wretched puling fool
a whining mammet in her fortune's tender
to answer I'll not wed I cannot love
'I am too young I pray you pardon me
but an you will not wed I'll pardon you
graze where you will you shall not house with me
look to't think on't I do not use to jest
Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
an you be mine I'll give you to my friend
an you be not hang beg starve die in the streets
for by my soul I'll ne'er acknowledge thee
nor what is mine shall never do thee good
trust to't bethink you I'll not be forsworn

is there no pity sitting in the clouds
that sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother cast me not away
delay this marriage for a month a week
or if you do not make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where Tybalt lies

talk not to me for I'll not speak a word
do as thou wilt for I have done with thee


O God O nurse how shall this be prevented
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven
how shall that faith return again to earth
unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving earth comfort me counsel me
alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
upon so soft a subject as myself
what sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy

faith here it is Romeo
is banished and all the world to nothing
that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you
or if he do it needs must be by stealth
then since the case so stands as now it doth
I think it best you married with the county
O he's a lovely gentleman
Romeo's a dishclout to him an eagle madam
hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
as Paris hath Beshrew my very heart
I think you are happy in this second match
for it excels your first or if it did not
your first is dead or twere as good he were
as living here and you no use of him

speakest thou from thy heart

and from my soul too

amen

what

well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
go in and tell my lady I am gone
having displeas'd my father to Laurence' cell
to make confession and to be absolv'd

marry I will and this is wisely done


ancient damnation O most wicked fiend
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
which she hath prais'd him with above compare
so many thousand times Go counsellor
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
if all else fail myself have power to die


on Thursday sir the time is very short

my father Capulet will have it so
and I am nothing slow to slack his haste

you say you do not know the lady's mind
uneven is the course I like it not

immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death
and therefore have I little talk'd of love
for Venus smiles not in a house of tears
now sir her father counts it dangerous
that she doth give her sorrow so much sway
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears
which too much minded by herself alone
now do you know the reason of this haste

I would I knew not why it should be slow'd
look sir here comes the lady towards my cell


happily met my lady and my wife

that may be sir when I may be a wife

that may be must be love on Thursday next

what must be shall be

that's a certain text

come you to make confession to this father

to answer that I should confess to you
do not deny to him that you love me

I will confess to you that I love him

so will ye I am sure that you love me

if I do so it will be of more price
being spoke behind your back than to your face

poor soul thy face is much abus'd with tears

the tears have got small victory by that
for it was bad enough before their spite

thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report

that is no slander sir which is a truth
and what I spake I spake it to my face


it may be so for it is not mine own
are you at leisure holy father now
or shall I come to you at evening mass

my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
my lord we must entreat the time alone

God shield I should disturb devotion
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse you
till then adieu and keep this holy kiss


O shut the door and when thou hast done so
come weep with me past hope past cure past help

Ah Juliet I already know thy grief
it strains me past the compass of my wits
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it

tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this
unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
do thou but call my resolution wise
and with this knife I'll help it presently
God join'd my heart and Romeo's thou our hands
and ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal'd
shall be the label to another deed
or my true heart with treacherous revolt
turn to another this shall slay them both
therefore out of thy long-experienc'd time
give me some present counsel or behold
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
shall play the umpire arbitrating that
which the commission of thy years and art
could to no issue of true honour bring
be not so long to speak I long to die
if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy
hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
which craves as desperate an execution
as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than to marry County Paris
thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
then is it likely thou wilt undertake
a thing like death to chide away this shame
that cop'st with death himself to scape from it
and if thou dar'st I'll give thee remedy

O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
from off the battlements of yonder tower
or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
or shut me nightly in a charnel-house
o'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
or bid me go into a new-made grave
and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
and I will do it without fear or doubt
to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love

hold then go home be merry give consent
to marry Paris Wednesday is to-morrow
to-morrow night look that thou lie alone
let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
take thou this vial being then in bed
and this distilled liquor drink thou off
when presently through all thy veins shall run
a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
shall keep his native progress but surcease
no warmth no breath shall testify thou liv'st
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
to paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall
like death when he shuts up the day of life
each part depriv'd of supple government
shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
and in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
then as the manner of our country is
in thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
in the mean time against thou shalt awake
shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
and hither shall he come and he and I
will watch thy waking and that very night
shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
and this shall free thee from this present shame
if no unconstant toy nor womanish fear
abate thy valour in the acting it

give me give me O tell me not of fear

hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
to Mantua with my letters to thy lord

love give me strength and strength shall help afford
farewell dear father


so many guests invite as here are writ

sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks

you shall have none ill sir for
I'll try if they can lick their fingers

how canst thou try them so

marry sir tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me

go be gone

what is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence

ay forsooth

well he may chance to do some good on her
a peevish self-will'd harlotry it is

see where she comes from shrift with merry look


how now my headstrong where have you been gadding

where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition
to you and your behests and am enjoin'd
by holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
and beg your pardon Pardon I beseech you
henceforward I am ever rul'd by you

I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning

I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
and gave him what becomed love I might
not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty

why I'm glad on't this is well stand up
this is as't should be Let me see the county
ay marry go I say and fetch him hither
now afore God this reverend holy friar
all our whole city is much bound to him

nurse will you go with me into my closet
to help me sort such needful ornaments
as you think fit to furnish me to-morrow

no not till Thursday there is time enough

go nurse go with her We'll to church to-morrow

we shall be short in our provision
'Tis now near night

tush I will stir about
and all things shall be well I warrant thee wife
go thou to Juliet help to deck up her
I'll not to bed to-night let me alone
I'll play the housewife for this once What ho
they are all forth well I will walk myself
to County Paris to prepare him up
against to-morrow My heart is wondrous light
since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd


ay those attires are best but gentle nurse
I pray thee leave me to myself to-night
for I have need of many orisons
to move the heavens to smile upon my state


what are you busy ho need you my help

no madam we have cull'd such necessaries
as are behoveful for our state to-morrow
so please you let me now be left alone
and let the nurse this night sit up with you
for I am sure you have your hands full all
in this so sudden business

good-night
get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need


farewell God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
that almost freezes up the heat of life
I'll call them back again to comfort me
my dismal scene I needs must act alone
come vial
what if this mixture do not work at all
shall I be married then to-morrow morning
no no this shall forbid it lie thou there

what if it be a poison which the friar
subtly hath minister'd to have me dead
lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
because he married me before to Romeo
I fear it is and yet methinks it should not
for he hath still been tried a holy man
I will not entertain so bad a thought
how if when I am laid into the tomb
I wake before the time that Romeo
come to redeem me there's a fearful point
shall I not then be stifled in the vault
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
and there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
the horrible conceit of death and night
together with the terror of the place
as in a vault an ancient receptacle
where for these many hundred years the bones
of all my buried ancestors are pack'd
where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
lies festering in his shroud where as they say
at some hours in the night spirits resort
alack alack is it not like that I
so early waking what with loathsome smells
and shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth
that living mortals hearing them run mad
O if I wake shall I not be distraught
environed with all these hideous fears
and madly play with my forefathers' joints
and pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
and in this rage with some great kinsman's bone
as with a club dash out my desperate brains
O look methinks I see my cousin's ghost
upon a rapier's point Stay Tybalt stay
Romeo I come this do I drink to thee


hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse

they call for dates and quinces in the pastry


come stir stir stir the second cock hath crow'd
the curfew bell hath rung tis three o'clock
look to the bak'd meats good Angelica
spare not for cost

go go you cot-quean go
get you to bed faith you'll be sick to-morrow
for this night's watching

no not a whit what I have watch'd ere now

ay you have been a mouse-hunt in your time
but I will watch you from such watching now


a jealous-hood a jealous-hood

make haste make haste

call Peter he will show thee where they are

and never trouble Peter for the matter

why lamb why lady fie you slug-a-bed
what not a word you take your pennyworths now
sleep for a week for the next night I warrant
the County Paris hath set up his rest
that you shall rest but little God forgive me
marry and amen how sound is she asleep
I needs must wake her Madam madam madam
ay let the county take you in your bed
he'll fright you up i' faith Will it not be
what dress'd and in your clothes and down again
I must needs wake you Lady lady lady
alas alas Help help my lady's dead
O well-a-day that ever I was born
some aqua-vit ho My lord my lady


what noise is here

O lamentable day


look look O heavy day

O me O me my child my only life
revive look up or I will die with thee
help help Call help


for shame bring Juliet forth her lord is come

she's dead deceas'd she's dead alack the day

alack the day she's dead she's dead she's dead

ha let me see her Out alas she's cold
her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
life and these lips have long been separated
death lies on her like an untimely frost
upon the sweetest flower of all the field
O lamentable day

O woeful time

death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail
ties up my tongue and will not let me speak


come is the bride ready to go to church

ready to go but never to return
O son the night before thy wedding-day
hath Death lain with thy wife There she lies
flower as she was deflowered by him
death is my son-in-law Death is my heir
my daughter he hath wedded I will die
and leave him all life living all is Death's

have I thought long to see this morning's face

accurs'd unhappy wretched hateful-day
most miserable hour that e'er time saw
in lasting labour of his pilgrimage
but one poor one one poor and loving child
but one thing to rejoice and solace in
and cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight

O woe O woeful woeful woeful day
most lamentable day most woeful day
that ever ever I did yet behold
O day O day O day O hateful day
never was seen so black a day as this
O woeful day O woeful day

beguil'd divorced wronged spited slain
most detestable death by thee beguil'd
by cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
O love O life not life but love in death
despis'd distressed hated martyr'd kill'd
uncomfortable time why cam'st thou now
to murder murder our solemnity
O child O child my soul and not my child
dead art thou dead alack my child is dead
and with my child my joys are buried

peace ho for shame confusion's cure lives not
in these confusions Heaven and yourself
had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
and all the better is it for the maid
your part in her you could not keep from death
but heaven keeps his part in eternal life
the most you sought was her promotion
for twas your heaven she should be advanc'd
and weep ye now seeing she is advanc'd
above the clouds as high as heaven itself
O in this love you love your child so ill
that you run mad seeing that she is well
but she's best married that dies married young
dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
on this fair corse and as the custom is
in all her best array bear her to church
for though fond nature bids us all lament
yet nature's tears are reason's merriment

all things that we ordained festival
turn from their office to black funeral
our instruments to melancholy bells
our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
and all things change them to the contrary

sir go you in and madam go with him
and go Sir Paris every one prepare
to follow this fair corse unto her grave
the heavens do lower upon you for some ill


faith we may put up our pipes and be gone

honest good fellows ah put up put up for well you know this is a pitiful case


ay by my troth the case may be amended


musicians O musicians Heart's ease Heart's ease O an ye will have me live play Heart's ease

why Heart's ease

O musicians because my heart itself plays My heart is full of woe O play me some merry dump to comfort me

not a dump we tis no time to play now

you will not then
no

I will then give it you soundly

what will you give us

no money on my faith but the gleek
I will give you the minstrel

then will I give you the serving-creature

then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate I will carry no crotchets
I'll re you I'll fa you Do you note me

an you re us and fa us you note us

pray you put up your dagger and put out your wit

then have at you with my wit I will dry-beat you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger Answer me like men
when griping grief the heart doth wound
and doleful dumps the mind oppress
then music with her silver sound

why silver sound why music with her silver sound What say you Simon Catling

marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound

pretty What say you Hugh Rebeck

I say silver sound because musicians sound for silver

pretty too What say you James Soundpost

faith I know not what to say

O I cry you mercy you are the singer
I will say for you It is music with her silver sound because musicians have no gold for sounding

with speedy help doth lend redress

what a pestilent knave is this same

hang him Jack Come we'll in here tarry for the mourners and stay dinner


if I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
my dreams presage some joyful news at hand
my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne
and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
and breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
that I reviv'd and was an emperor
Ah me how sweet is love itself possess'd
when but love's shadows are so rich in joy

news from Verona How now Balthasar
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
how doth my lady Is my father well
how fares my Juliet That I ask again

for nothing can be ill if she be well

then she is well and nothing can be ill
her body sleeps in Capel's monument
and her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
and presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news
since you did leave it for my office sir

is it even so then I defy you stars
thou know'st my lodging get me ink and paper
and hire post-horses I will hence to-night

your looks are pale and wild and do import
some misadventure

tush thou art deceiv'd
leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
hast thou no letters to me from the friar

no my good lord

no matter get thee gone
and hire those horses I'll be with thee straight

well Juliet I will he with thee to-night
let's see for means O mischief thou art swift
to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember an apothecary
and hereabouts he dwells which late I noted
in tatter'd weeds with overwhelming brows
culling of simples meagre were his looks
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
an alligator stuff'd and other skins
of ill-shap'd fishes and about his shelves
a beggarly account of empty boxes
green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
were thinly scatter'd to make up a show
noting this penury to myself I said
an if a man did need a poison now
whose sale is present death in Mantua
here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
O this same thought did but fore-run my need
and this same needy man must sell it me
as I remember this should be the house
being holiday the beggar's shop is shut
what ho apothecary


who calls so loud
come hither man I see that thou art poor
hold there is forty ducats let me have
a dram of poison such soon-speeding gear
as will disperse itself through all the veins
that the life-weary taker may fall dead
and that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
as violently as hasty powder fir'd
doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb

such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law
is death to any he that utters them

art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
and fear'st to die famine is in thy cheeks
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
contempt and beggary hang upon thy back
the world is not thy friend nor the world's law
the world affords no law to make thee rich
then be not poor but break it and take this
my poverty but not my will consents

I pay thy poverty and not thy will

put this in any liquid thing you will
and drink it off and if you had the strength
of twenty men it would dispatch you straight

there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls
doing more murders in this loathsome world
than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
come cordial and not poison go with me
to Juliet's grave for there must I use thee


holy Franciscan friar brother ho

this same should be the voice of Friar John
welcome from Mantua what says Romeo
or if his mind be writ give me his letter

going to find a bare-foot brother out
one of our order to associate me
here in this city visiting the sick
and finding him the searchers of the town
suspecting that we both were in a house
where the infectious pestilence did reign
seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth
so that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd

who bare my letter then to Romeo

I could not send it here it is again
nor get a messenger to bring it thee
so fearful were they of infection

the letter was not nice but full of charge
of dear import and the neglecting it
may do much danger Friar John go hence
get me an iron crow and bring it straight
unto my cell

brother I'll go and bring it thee


now must I to the monument alone
within these three hours will fair Juliet wake
she will beshrew me much that Romeo
hath had no notice of these accidents
but I will write again to Mantus
and keep her at my cell till Romeo come
poor living corse clos'd in a dead man's tomb


give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof
under yond yew-trees lay thee all along
holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
but thou shalt hear it whistle then to me
as signal that thou hear'st something approach
give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go

I am almost afraid to stand alone
here in the churchyard yet I will adventure


sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
O woe thy canopy is dust and stones
which with sweet water nightly I will dew
or wanting that with tears distill'd by moans
the obsequies that I for thee will keep
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep

what cursed foot wanders this way to-night
to cross my obsequies and true love's rite
what with a torch muffle me night awhile

give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
hold take this letter early in the morning
see thou deliver it to my lord and father
give me the light upon thy life I charge thee
whate'er thou hear'st or seest stand all aloof
and do not interrupt me in my course
why I descend into this bed of death
is partly to behold my lady's face
but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
a precious ring a ring that I must use
in dear employment therefore hence be gone
but if thou jealous dost return to pry
in what I further shall intend to do
by heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
more fierce and more inexorable far
than empty tigers or the roaring sea

I will be gone sir and not trouble you

so shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow

for all this same I'll hide me here about
his looks I fear and his intents I doubt


thou detestable maw thou womb of death
gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth
thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open

and in despite I'll cram thee with more food

this is that banish'd haughty Montague
it is supposed the fair creature died
and here is come to do some villanous shame
to the dead bodies I will apprehend him

stop thy unhallow'd toil vile Montague
can vengeance be pursu'd further than death
condemned villain I do apprehend thee
obey and go with me for thou must die

I must indeed and therefore came I hither
good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
fly hence and leave me think upon these gone
let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
put not another sin upon my head
by urging me to fury O be gone
by heaven I love thee better than myself
for I come hither arm'd against myself
stay not be gone live and hereafter say
a madman's mercy bade thee run away
I do defy thy conjurations
and apprehend thee for a felon here

wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy


O Lord they fight I will go call the watch


O I am slain If thou be merciful
open the tomb lay me with Juliet


in faith I will Let me peruse this face
Mercutio's kinsman noble County Paris
what said my man when my betossed soul
did not attend him as we rode I think
he told me Paris should have married Juliet
said he not so or did I dream it so
to think it was so O give me thy hand
one writ with me in sour misfortune's book
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave
a grave O no a lanthorn slaughter'd youth
for here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
this vault a feasting presence full of light
death lie thou there by a dead man interr'd

how oft when men are at the point of death
have they been merry which their keepers call
a lightning before death O how may I
call this a lightning O my love my wife
death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
thou art not conquer'd beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
and death's pale flag is not advanced there
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
O what more favour can I do to thee
to sunder his that was thine enemy
forgive me cousin Ah dear Juliet
why art thou yet so fair Shall I believe
that unsubstantial Death is amorous
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour
for fear of that I still will stay with thee
and never from this palace of dim night
depart again here here will I remain
with worms that are thy chambermaids O here
will I set up my everlasting rest
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh Eyes look your last
arms take your last embrace and lips O you
the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing death
come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
thou desperate pilot now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark

O true apothecary
thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss I die

Saint Francis be my speed how oft to-night
have my old feet stumbled at graves Who's there

here's one a friend and one that knows you well

bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend
what torch is yond that vainly lends his light
to grubs and eyeless skulls as I discern
it burneth in the Capel's monument

it doth so holy sir and there's my master
one that you love

who is it


how long hath he been there

full half an hour

go with me to the vault

I dare not sir
my master knows not but I am gone hence
and fearfully did menace me with death
if I did stay to look on his intents

stay then I'll go alone Fear comes upon me
O much I fear some ill unlucky thing

as I did sleep under this yew-tree here
I dreamt my master and another fought
and that my master slew him

alack alack what blood is this which stains
the stony entrance of this sepulchre
what mean these masterless and gory swords
to lie discolour'd by this place of peace

Romeo O pale Who else what Paris too
and steep'd in blood Ah what an unkind hour
is guilty of this lamentable chance
the lady stirs


O comfortable friar where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be
and there I am Where is my Romeo


I hear some noise Lady come from that nest
of death contagion and unnatural sleep
a greater power than we can contradict
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead
and Paris too come I'll dispose of thee
among a sisterhood of holy nuns
stay not to question for the watch is coming
come go good Juliet

I dare no longer stay

go get thee hence for I will not away

what's here a cup clos'd in my true love's hand
poison I see hath been his timeless end
O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop
to help me after I will kiss thy lips
haply some poison yet doth hang on them
to make me die with a restorative

thy lips are warm


yea noise then I'll be brief O happy dagger

this is thy sheath

there rest and let me die

this is the place there where the torch doth burn

the ground is bloody search about the churchyard
go some of you whoe'er you find attach

pitiful sight here lies the county slain
and Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
who here hath lain these two days buried
go tell the prince run to the Capulets
raise up the Montagues some others search

we see the ground whereon these woes do lie
we cannot without circumstance descry


here's Romeo's man we found him in the churchyard

hold him in safety till the prince come hither


here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
we took this mattock and this spade from him
as he was coming from this churchyard side

a great suspicion stay the friar too


what misadventure is so early up
that calls our person from our morning's rest



the people in the street cry Romeo
some Juliet and some Paris and all run
with open outcry toward our monument

what fear is this which startles in our ears

sovereign here lies the County Paris slain
and Romeo dead and Juliet dead before
warm and new kill'd

search seek and know how this foul murder comes

here is a friar and slaughter'd Romeo's man
with instruments upon them fit to open
these dead men's tombs

O heaven O wife look how our daughter bleeds
this dagger hath mista'en for lo his house
and is mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom

O me this sight of death is as a bell
that warns my old age to a sepulchre


come Montague for thou art early up
to see thy son and heir more early down

alas my liege my wife is dead to-night
grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath
what further woe conspires against mine age

look and thou shalt see

O thou untaught what manners is in this
to press before thy father to a grave

seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
and know their spring their head their true descent
and then will I be general of your woes
and lead you even to death meantime forbear
and let mischance be slave to patience
bring forth the parties of suspicion

I am the greatest able to do least
yet most suspected as the time and place
doth make against me of this direful murder
and here I stand both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excus'd

then say at once what thou dost know in this

I will be brief for my short date of breath
is not so long as is a tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
and she there dead that Romeo's faithful wife
I married them and their stolen marriage-day
banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city
for whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pin'd
you to remove that siege of grief from her
betroth'd and would have married her perforce
to County Paris then comes she to me
and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
to rid her from this second marriage
or in my cell there would she kill herself
then gave I her so tutor'd by my art
a sleeping potion which so took effect
as I intended for it wrought on her
the form of death meantime I writ to Romeo
that he should hither come as this dire night
to help to take her from her borrow'd grave
being the time the potion's force should cease
but he which bore my letter Friar John
was stay'd by accident and yesternight
return'd my letter back Then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking
meaning to keep her closely at my cell
till I conveniently could send to Romeo
but when I came some minute ere the time
of her awakening here untimely lay
the noble Paris and true Romeo dead
she wakes and I entreated her come forth
and bear this work of heaven with patience
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
and she too desperate would not go with me
but as it seems did violence on herself
all this I know and to the marriage
her nurse is privy and if aught in this
miscarried by my fault let my old life
be sacrific'd some hour before his time
unto the rigour of severest law

we still have known thee for a holy man
where's Romeo's man what can he say in this

and then in post he came from Mantua
to this same place to this same monument
this letter he early bid me give his father
and threaten'd me with death going in the vault
if I departed not and left him there

give me the letter I will look on it
where is the county's page that rais'd the watch
sirrah what made your master in this place

he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
and bid me stand aloof and so I did
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
and by and by my master drew on him
and then I ran away to call the watch

this letter doth make good the friar's words
their course of love the tidings of her death
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
where be these enemies Capulet Montague
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
and I for winking at your discords too
have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish'd

O brother Montague give me thy hand
this is my daughter's jointure for no more
can I demand

but I can give thee more
for I will raise her statue in pure gold
that while Verona by that name is known
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful Juliet

as rich shall Romeo by his lady lie
poor sacrifices of our enmity
a glooming peace this morning with it brings
the sun for sorrow will not show his head
go hence to have more talk of these sad things
some shall be pardon'd and some punished
for never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo

TIMON OF ATHENS

good day sir

I am glad you're well

I have not seen you long How goes the world

it wears sir as it grows

ay that's well known
but what particular rarity what strange
magic of bounty all these spirits thy power
hath conjur'd to attend I know the merchant

I know them both th' other's a jeweller

O tis a worthy lord

nay that's most fix'd

a most incomparable man breath'd as it were
to an untirable and continuate goodness
he passes

I have a jewel here

O pray let's see t for the Lord Timon sir

if he will touch the estimate but for that

it stains the glory in that happy verse
which aptly sings the good

'Tis a good form

and rich here is a water look ye

you are rapt sir in some work some dedication
to the great lord

a thing slipp'd idly from me
our poesy is as a gum which oozes
from whence tis nourish'd the fire i' the flint
shows not till it be struck our gentle flame
provokes itself and like the current flies
each bound it chafes What have you there

a picture sir When comes your book forth

let's see your piece

'Tis a good piece

so tis this comes off well and excellent

indifferent

admirable How this grace
speaks his own standing what a mental power
this eye shoots forth how big imagination
moves in this lip to the dumbness of the gesture
one might interpret

it is a pretty mocking of the life
here is a touch is t good

I'll say of it
it tutors nature artificial strife


how this lord is follow'd

the senators of Athens happy man

look more

you see this confluence this great flood of visitors
I have in this rough work shap'd out a man
whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
with amplest entertainment my free drift
halts not particularly but moves itself
in a wide sea of wax no levell'd malice
infects one comma in the course I hold
but flies an eagle flight bold and forth on
leaving no tract behind

how shall I understand you
I will unbolt to you
you see how all conditions how all minds
as well of glib and slippery creatures as
of grave and austere quality tender down
their services to Lord Timon his large fortune
upon his good and gracious nature hanging
subdues and properties to his love and tendance
all sorts of hearts yea from the glass-fac'd flatterer
to Apemantus that few things loves better
than to abhor himself even he drops down
the knee before him and returns in peace
most rich in Timon's nod

I saw them speak together

sir I have upon a high and pleasant hill
feign'd Fortune to be thron'd the base o' the mount
is rank'd with all deserts all kind of natures
that labour on the bosom of this sphere
whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd
one do I personate of Lord Timon's frame
whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her
whose present grace to present slaves and servants
translates his rivals

'Tis conceiv'd to scope
this throne this Fortune and this hill methinks
with one man beckon'd from the rest below
bowing his head against the steepy mount
to climb his happiness would be well express'd
in our condition

nay sir but hear me on
all those which were his fellows but of late
some better than his value on the moment
follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance
rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear
make sacred even his stirrup and through him

ay marry what of these

when Fortune in her shift and change of mood
spurns down her late belov'd all his dependants
which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
even on their knees and hands let him slip down
not one accompanying his declining foot

'Tis common
a thousand moral paintings I can show
that shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
more pregnantly than words Yet you do well
to show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
the foot above the head


imprison'd is he say you

his means most short his creditors most strait
your honourable letter he desires
to those have shut him up which failing
periods his comfort

noble Ventidius Well
I am not of that feather to shake off
my friend when he must need me I do know him
a gentleman that well deserves a help
which he shall have I'll pay the debt and free him

your lordship ever binds him

commend me to him I will send his ransom
and being enfranchis'd bid him come to me
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up
but to support him after Fare you well

all happiness to your honour
lord Timon hear me speak

freely good father

thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius

I have so what of him

most noble Timon call the man before thee

attends be here or no Lucilius

here at your lordship's service

this fellow here Lord Timon this thy creature
by night frequents my house I am a man
that from my first have been inclin'd to thrift
and my estate deserves an heir more rais'd
than one which holds a trencher
well what further

one only daughter have I no kin else
on whom I may confer what I have got
the maid is fair o' the youngest for a bride
and I have bred her at my dearest cost
in qualities of the best This man of thine
attempts her love I prithee noble lord
join with me to forbid him her resort
myself have spoke in vain

the man is honest

therefore he will be Timon
his honesty rewards him in itself
it must not bear my daughter

does she love him

our own precedent passions do instruct us
what levity's in youth

love you the maid

ay my good lord and she accepts of it

if in her marriage my consent be missing
I call the gods to witness I will choose
mine heir from forth the beggars of the world
and dispossess her all

how shall she be endow'd
if she be mated with an equal husband

three talents on the present in future all

this gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long
to build his fortune I will strain a little
what you bestow in him I'll counterpoise
and make him weigh with her

most noble lord
pawn me to this your honour she is his

my hand to thee mine honour on my promise

humbly I thank your lordship never may
that state or fortune fall into my keeping
which is not ow'd to you


vouchsafe my labour and long live your lordship

I thank you you shall hear from me anon
go not away What have you there my friend

a piece of painting which I do beseech

painting is welcome
the painting is almost the natural man
for since dishonour traffics with man's nature
he is but outside these pencil'd figures are
even such as they give out I like your work
and you shall find I like it wait attendance
till you hear further from me

the gods preserve you

well fare you gentleman give me your hand
we must needs dine together Sir your jewel
hath suffer'd under praise

what my lord dispraise

a mere satiety of commendations
if I should pay you for t as tis extoll'd

my lord tis rated
as those which sell would give but you well know
things of like value differing in the owners
are prized by their masters Believe t dear lord
you mend the jewel by the wearing it

well mock'd

no my good lord he speaks the common tongue
which all men speak with him

look who comes here Will you be chid


we'll bear with your lordship

he'll spare none


till I be gentle stay thou for thy good morrow
when thou art Timon's dog and these knaves honest

why dost thou call them knaves thou know'st them not

are they not Athenians

yes

then I repent not

you know me Apemantus

thou know'st I do I call'd thee by thy name

thou art proud Apemantus

of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon
whither art going

to knock out an honest Athenian's brains

that's a deed thou'lt die for

right if doing nothing be death by the law

how likest thou this picture Apemantus

the best for the innocence

wrought he not well that painted it

he wrought better that made the painter and yet he's but a filthy piece of work

you're a dog

thy mother's of my generation what's she if I be a dog
wilt dine with me Apemantus

no I eat not lords

an thou shouldst thou'dst anger ladies

O they eat lords so they come by great bellies

that's a lascivious apprehension

so thou apprehendest it take it for thy labour

how dost thou like this jewel Apemantus

not so well as plain-dealing which will not cost a man a doit

what dost thou think tis worth

not worth my thinking How now poet
how now philosopher

thou liest

art not one

yes

then I lie not

art not a poet

yes

then thou liest look in thy last work where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow

that's not feigned he is so

yes he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy labour he that loves to be flattered is worthy o' the flatterer Heavens that I were a lord
what wouldst do then Apemantus

even as Apemantus does now hate a lord with my heart

what thyself

ay

wherefore

that I had no angry wit to be a lord
art not thou a merchant

ay Apemantus

traffic confound thee if the gods will not

if traffic do it the gods do it



what trumpet's that

'Tis Alcihiades and some twenty horse
all of companionship

pray entertain them give them guide to us

you must needs dine with me Go not you hence
till I have thanked you when dinner's done
show me this piece I am joyful of your sights

most welcome sir

so so there
aches contract and starve your supple joints
that there should be small love mongst these sweet knaves
and all this courtesy The strain of man's bred out

sir you have sav'd my longing and I feed
most hungerly on your sight

right welcome sir
ere we depart we'll share a bounteous time
in different pleasures Pray you let us in

what time o'day is't Apemantus

time to be honest

that time serves still

the more accursed thou that still omitt'st it

thou art going to Lord Timon's feast

ay to see meat fill khaves and wine heat fools
fare thee well fare thee well

thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice

why Apemantus

shouldst have kept one to thyself for I mean to give thee none

hang thyself

no I will do nothing at thy bidding make thy requests to thy friend

away unpeaceable dog or I'll spurn thee hence

I will fly like a dog the heels of an ass


he's opposite to humanity Come shall we in
and taste Lord Timon's bounty he outgoes

he pours it out Plutus the god of gold
is but his steward no meed but he repays
sevenfold above itself no gift to him
but breeds the giver a return exceeding
all use of quittance

the noblest mind he carries
that ever govern'd man

long may he live in fortunes
shall we in

I'll keep you company

most honour'd Timon
it hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age
and call him to long peace
he is gone happy and has left me rich
to your free heart I do return those talents
doubled with thanks and service from whose help
I deriv'd liberty

O by no means
honest Ventidius you mistake my love
I gave it freely ever and there's none
can truly say he gives if he receives
if our betters play at that game we must not dare
to imitate them faults that are rich are fair

a noble spirit


nay my lords ceremony was but devis'd at first
to set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes
recanting goodness sorry ere tis shown
but where there is true friendship there needs none
pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes


my lord we always have confess'd it

ho ho confess'd it hang'd it have you not

O Apemantus you are welcome

no
you shall not make me welcome
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors

fie thou'rt a churl ye've got a humour there
does not become a man tis much to blame
they say my lords Ira furor brevis est
but yond man is ever angry
go let him have a table by himself
for he does neither affect company
nor is he fit for it indeed
let me stay at thine apperil Timon
I come to observe I give thee warning on't

I take no heed of thee thou'rt an Athenian therefore welcome I myself would have no power prithee let my meat make thee silent

I scorn thy meat twould choke me for I should
ne'er flatter thee O you gods what a number
of men eat Timon and he sees them not
it grieves me to see so many dip their meat
in one man's blood and all the madness is
he cheers them up too
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men
methinks they should invite them without knives
good for their meat and safer for their lives
there's much example for't the fellow that
sits next him now parts bread with him and pledges
the breath of him in a divided draught
is the readiest man to kill him t has been prov'd
if I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals
great men should drink with harness on their throats

my lord in heart and let the health go round

let it flow this way my good lord

flow this way A brave fellow he keeps his tides well Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill Timon
here's that which is too weak to be a sinner
honest water which ne'er left man i' the mire
this and my food are equals there's no odds
feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods

immortal gods I crave no pelf
I pray for no man but myself
grant I may never prove so fond
to trust man on his oath or bond
or a harlot for her weeping
or a dog that seems a-sleeping
or a keeper with my freedom
amen So fall to't
rich men sin and I eat root


much good dich thy good heart Apemantus

captain Alcibiades your heart's in the field now

my heart is ever at your service my lord

you had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends

so they were bleeding-new my lord there's no meat like em I could wish my best friend at such a feast

'Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then that then thou mightst kill em and bid me to em

might we but have that happiness my lord that you would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect

O no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you how had you been my friends else why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf and thus far I confirm you O you gods think I what need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of em they were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er have use for em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious comfort tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another's fortunes O joy e'en made away ere it can be born Mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks to forget their faults I drink to you
thou weepest to make them drink Timon

joy had the like conception in our eyes
and at that instant like a babe sprung up

ho ho I laugh to think that babe a bastard

I promise you my lord you mov'd me much

much


what means that trump

how now

please you my lord there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance

ladies What are their wills
there comes with them a forerunner my lord which bears that office to signify their pleasures

I pray let them be admitted


hail to thee worthy Timon and to all
that of his bounties taste The five best senses
acknowledge thee their patron and come freely
to gratulate thy plenteous bosom Th' ear
taste touch smell pleas'd from thy table rise
they only now come but to feast thine eyes

they are welcome all let em have kind admittance
music make their welcome


you see my lord how ample you're belov'd

hoy-day what a sweep of vanity comes this way
like madness is the glory of this life
as this pomp shows to a little oil and root
we make ourselves fools to disport ourselves
and spend our flatteries to drink those men
upon whose age we void it up again
with poisonous spite and envy
who lives that's not depraved or depraves
who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
of their friend's gift
I should fear those that dance before me now
would one day stamp upon me it has been done
men shut their doors against a setting sun


you have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies
set a fair fashion on our entertainment
which was not half so beautiful and kind
you have added worth unto t and lustre
and entertain'd me with mine own device

my lord you take us even at the best

faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold taking I doubt me

ladies there is an idle banquet
attends you please you to dispose yourselves

most thankfully my lord


Flavius

my lord

the little casket bring me hither

yes my lord

there is no crossing him in s humour
else I should tell him well i' faith I should
when all's spent he'd be cross'd then an he could
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind
that man might ne'er be wretched for his mind


where be our men

here my lord in readiness

our horses


O my friends I have one word to say to you
look you my good lord
I must entreat you honour me so much
as to advance this jewel accept it and wear it
kind my lord
I am so far already in your gifts

so are we all


my lord there are certain nobles of the senate
newly alighted and come to visit you

they are fairly welcome

I beseech your honour
vouchsafe me a word it does concern you near

near why then another time I'll hear thee
I prithee let's be provided to show them entertainment

I scarce know how


out of his free love hath presented to you
four milk-white horses trapp'd in silver

I shall accept them fairly let the presents
be worthily entertain'd

how now what news

please you my lord that honourable gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company to-morrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds

I'll hunt with him and let them be receiv'd
not without fair reward

what will this come to
he commands us to provide and give great gifts
and all out of an empty coffer
nor will he know his purse or yield me this
to show him what a beggar his heart is
being of no power to make his wishes good
that what he speaks is all in debt he owes
for every word he is so kind that he now
pays interest for't his land's put to their books
well would I were gently put out of office
before I were forc'd out
happier he that has no friend to feed
than such as do e'en enemies exceed
I bleed inwardly for my lord


you do yourselves
much wrong you bate too much of your own merits
here my lord a trifle of our love

with more than common thanks I will receive it

O he's the very soul of bounty

and now I remember my lord you gave
I rode on it is yours because you lik'd it

O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that

you may take my word my lord I know no man
can justly praise but what he does affect
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own
I'll tell you true I'll call to you

O none so welcome

I take all and your several visitations
so kind to heart tis not enough to give
methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends
and ne'er be weary Alcibiades
thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich
it comes in charity to thee for all thy living
is mongst the dead and all the lands thou hast
lie in a pitch'd field
ay defil'd land my lord

we are so virtuously bound

and so
am I to you

so infinitely endear'd

all to you Lights more lights

the best of happiness
honour and fortunes keep with you Lord Timon

ready for his friends


what a coil's here
serving of becks and jutting out of bums
that are given for em Friendship's full of dregs
methinks false hearts should never have sound legs
thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies

now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen
I would be good to thee

no I'll nothing for if I should be bribed too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster Thou givest so long Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly what need these feasts pomps and vain-glories

nay an you begin to rail on society once I am sworn not to give regard to you Farewell and come with better music


so
thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then
I'll lock thy heaven from thee
O that men's ears should be
to counsel deaf but not to flattery

and late five thousand to Varro and to Isidore
which makes it five-and-twenty Still in motion
of raging waste It cannot hold it will not
if I want gold steal but a beggar's dog
and give it Timon why the dog coins gold
if I would sell my horse and buy twenty more
better than he why give my horse to Timon
ask nothing give it him it foals me straight
and able horses No porter at his gate
but rather one that smiles and still invites
all that pass by It cannot hold no reason
can found his state in safety Caphis ho
Caphis I say


here sir what is your pleasure

get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon
importune him for my moneys be not ceas'd
with slight denial nor then silenc'd when
plays in the right hand thus but tell him
my uses cry to me I must serve my turn
out of mine own his days and times are past
and my reliances on his fracted dates
have smit my credit I love and honour him
but must not break my back to heal his finger
immediate are my needs and my relief
must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words
but find supply immediate Get you gone
put on a most importunate aspect
a visage of demand for I do fear
when every feather sticks in his own wing
lord Timon will be left a naked gull
which flashes now a ph nix Get you gone

I go sir

'I go sir Take the bonds along with you
and have the dates in compt
I will sir

go


no care no stop so senseless of expense
that he will neither know how to maintain it
nor cease his flow of riot takes no account
how things go from him nor resumes no care
of what is to continue never mind
was to be so unwise to be so kind
what shall be done He will not hear till feel
I must be round with him now he comes from hunting
fie fie fie fie


good even Varro What
you come for money


it is and yours too Isidore

with clamorous demands of date-broke bonds
and the detention of long-since-due debts
against my honour

gramercies good fool How does your mistress

she's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are Would we could see you at Corinth

good gramercy


look you here comes my mistress' page

why how now captain what do you in this wise company How dost thou Apemantus

would I had a rod in my mouth that I might answer thee profitably
prithee Apemantus read me the superscription of these letters I know not which is which

canst not read

no

there will little learning die then that day thou art hanged This is to Lord Timon this to Alcibiades Go thou wast born a bastard and thou'lt die a bawd

thou wast whelped a dog and thou shalt famish a dog's death Answer not I am gone


e'en so thou outrunn'st grace
fool I will go with you to Lord Timon's

will you leave me there

if Timon stay at home You three serve three usurers

ay would they served us
so would I as good a trick as ever hangman served thief

are you three usurers' men

ay fool

I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant my mistress is one and I am her fool When men come to borrow of your masters they approach sadly and go away merry but they enter my mistress' house merrily and go away sadly the reason of this

I could render one

do it then that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave which notwithstanding thou shalt be no less esteemed

what is a whoremaster fool

a fool in good clothes and something like thee Tis a spirit sometime t appears like a lord sometime like a lawyer sometime like a philosopher with two stones more than s artificial one He is very often like a knight and generally in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen this spirit walks in

thou art not altogether a fool

nor thou altogether a wise man as much foolery as I have so much wit thou lackest
that answer might have become Apemantus

aside aside here comes Lord Timon


come with me fool come

I do not always follow lover elder brother and woman sometime the philosopher


pray you walk near I'll speak with you anon


you make me marvel wherefore ere this time
had you not fully laid my state before me
that I might so have rated my expense
as I had leave of means

you would not hear me

go to
perchance some single vantages you took
when my indisposition put you back
and that unaptness made your minister
thus to excuse yourself

O my good lord
at many times I brought in my accounts
laid them before you you would throw them off
and say you found them in mine honesty
when for some trifling present you have bid me
return so much I have shook my head and wept
yea gainst the authority of manners pray'd you
to hold your hand more close I did endure
not seldom nor no slight checks when I have
prompted you in the ebb of your estate
and your great flow of debts My loved lord
though you hear now too late yet now's a time
to pay your present debts

let all my land be sold

'Tis all engag'd some forfeited and gone
and what remains will hardly stop the mouth
of present dues the future comes apace
what shall defend the interim and at length
how goes our reckoning

to Laced mon did my land extend

O my good lord the world is but a word
were it all yours to give it in a breath
how quickly were it gone

you tell me true

if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood
and set me on the proof So the gods bless me
when all our offices have been oppress'd
with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept
with drunken spilth of wine when every room
hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy
I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock
and set mine eyes at flow

prithee no more

heavens have I said the bounty of this lord
how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
this night englutted Who is not Timon's
what heart head sword force means but is Lord Timon's
great Timon noble worthy royal Timon
Ah when the means are gone that buy this praise
the breath is gone whereof this praise is made
feast-won fast-lost one cloud of winter showers
these flies are couch'd
come sermon me no further
no villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart
unwisely not ignobly have I given
why dost thou weep Canst thou the conscience lack
to think I shall lack friends Secure thy heart
if I would broach the vessels of my love
and try the argument of hearts by borrowing
men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
as I can bid thee speak

assurance bless your thoughts

and in some sort these wants of mine are crown'd
that I account them blessings for by these
shall I try friends You shall perceive how you
mistake my fortunes I am wealthy in my friends
within there Flaminius Servilius



I will dispatch you severally you to Lord Lucius to Lord Lucullus you I hunted with his honour to-day you to Sempronius Commend me to their loves and I am proud say that my occasions have found time to use them toward a supply of money let the request be fifty talents

as you have said my lord

lord Lucius and Lucullus hum

go you sir to the senators
of whom even to the state's best health I have
deserv'd this hearing bid em send o' the instant
a thousand talents to me

I have been bold
for that I knew it the most general way
to them to use your signet and your name
but they do shake their heads and I am here
no richer in return

is't true can't be
they answer in a joint and corporate voice
that now they are at fall want treasure cannot
do what they would are sorry you are honourable
but yet they could have wish'd they know not
something hath been amiss a noble nature
may catch a wrench would all were well tis pity
and so intending other serious matters
after distasteful looks and these hard fractions
with certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
they froze me into silence

you gods reward them
prithee man look cheerly These old fellows
have their ingratitude in them hereditary
their blood is cak'd tis cold it seldom flows
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind
and nature as it grows again toward earth
is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy

prithee be not sad
thou art true and honest ingenuously I speak
no blame belongs to thee

Ventidius lately
buried his father by whose death he's stepp'd
into a great estate when he was poor
imprison'd and in scarcity of friends
I clear'd him with five talents greet him from me
bid him suppose some good necessity
touches his friend which craves to be remember'd
with those five talents

that had give't these fellows
to whom tis instant due Ne'er speak or think
that Timon's fortunes mong his friends can sink

I would I could not think it that thought is bounty's foe
being free itself it thinks all others so
I have told my lord of you he is coming down to you

I thank you sir


here's my lord

one of Lord Timon's men a gift I warrant Why this hits right I dreamt of a silver bason and ewer to-night Flaminius honest Flaminius you are very respectively welcome sir Fill me some wine [Exit Servant ] And how does that honourable complete free-hearted gentleman of Athens thy very bountiful good lord and master

his health is well sir

I am right glad that his health is well sir And what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty Flaminius

faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lord's behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein

la la la la nothing doubting says he Alas good lord a noble gentleman tis if he would not keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha' dined with him and told him on't and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming Every man has his fault and honesty is his I ha' told him on't but I could ne'er get him from it


please your lordship here is the wine
Flaminius I have noted thee always wise Here's to thee

your lordship speaks your pleasure

I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and canst use the time well if the time use thee well good parts in thee

get you gone sirrah [Exit Servant ] Draw nearer honest Flaminius Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou knowest well enough although thou comest to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare friendship without security Here's three solidares for thee good boy wink at me and say thou sawest me not Fare thee well

is't possible the world should so much differ
and we alive that liv'd Fly damned baseness
to him that worships thee


ha now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master


may these add to the number that may scald thee
let molten coin be thy damnation
thou disease of a friend and not himself
it turns in less than two nights O you gods
I feel my master's passion This slave unto his honour
has my lord's meat in him
why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
when he is turn'd to poison
O may diseases only work upon t
and when he's sick to death let not that part of nature
which my lord paid for be of any power
to expel sickness but prolong his hour


who the Lord Timon he is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman

we know him for no less though we are but strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him

fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money

but believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely for t and showed what necessity belonged to t and yet was denied


I tell you denied my lord

what a strange case was that now before the gods I am ashamed on t Denied that honourable man there was very little honour showed in t For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents


see by good hap yonder's my lord I have sweat to see his honour

my honoured lord

Servilius you are kindly met sir Fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend

may it please your honour my lord hath sent

ha what has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord he's ever sending how shall I thank him thinkest thou And what has he sent now

he has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents

I know his lordship is but merry with me

but in the mean time he wants less my lord
if his occasion were not virtuous
I should not urge it half so faithfully

dost thou speak seriously Servilius

upon my soul tis true sir

what a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha' shown myself honourable how unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to do the more beast I say I was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind and tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him

yes sir I shall

I'll look you out a good turn Servilius

true as you said Timon is shrunk indeed
and he that's once denied will hardly speed



ay too well

why this is the world's soul and just of the same piece
is every flatterer's spirit Who can call him
his friend that dips in the same dish for in
my knowing Timon has been this lord's father
and kept his credit with his purse
supported his estate nay Timon's money
has paid his men their wages he ne'er drinks
but Timon's silver treads upon his lip
and yet O see the monstrousness of man
when he looks out in an ungrateful shape
he does deny him in respect of his
what charitable men afford to beggars

religion groans at it

for mine own part
nor came any of his bounties over me
to mark me for his friend yet I protest
for his right noble mind illustrious virtue
and honourable carriage
had his necessity made use of me
I would have put my wealth into donation
and the best half should have return'd to him
so much I love his heart But I perceive
men must learn now with pity to dispense
for policy sits above conscience


must he needs trouble me in t Hum bove all others
he might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus
and now Ventidius is wealthy too
whom he redeem'd from prison all these
owe their estates unto him

my lord
they have all denied him

how have they denied him
have Ventidius and Lucullus denied him
and does he send to me Three hum
it shows but little love or judgment in him
must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians
thrice give him over must I take the cure upon me
he has much disgrac'd me in t I'm angry at him
that might have known my place I see no sense for t
but his occasions might have woo'd me first
for in my conscience I was the first man
that e'er received gift from him
and does he think so backwardly of me now
that I'll requite it last No
so it may prove an argument of laughter
to the rest and I mongst lords be thought a fool
I had rather than the worth of thrice the sum
he had sent to me first but for my mind's sake
and with their faint reply this answer join
who bates mine honour shall not know my coin


excellent Your lordship's a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself by t and I cannot think but in the end the villanies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire
of such a nature is his politic love
this was my lord's best hope now all are fled
save only the gods Now his friends are dead
doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
many a bounteous year must be employ'd
now to guard sure their master
and this is all a liberal course allows
who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house

well met good morrow Titus and Hortensius

the like to you kind Varro

Lucius

ay and I think
one business does command us all for mine
is money

so is theirs and ours


and Sir Philotus too

good day at once

welcome good brother
what do you think the hour

labouring for nine

so much


not yet

I wonder on t he was wont to shine at seven

ay but the days are waxed shorter with him
you must consider that a prodigal course
is like the sun's but not like his recoverable
I fear
'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse
that is one may reach deep enough and yet
find little

I am of your fear for that

I'll show you how to observe a strange event
your lord sends now for money

most true he does
and he wears jewels now of Timon's gift
for which I wait for money

it is against my heart

mark how strange it shows
Timon in this should pay more than he owes
and e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
and send for money for em

I'm weary of this charge the gods can witness
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth
and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth

yes mine's three thousand crowns what's yours

five thousand mine

'Tis much deep and it should seem by the sum
else surely his had equall'd


one of Lord Timon's men

Flaminius Sir a word Pray is my lord ready to come forth

no indeed he is not

we attend his lordship pray signify so much

I need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent

ha is not that his steward muffled so
he goes away in a cloud call him call him

do you hear sir

by your leave sir
what do you ask of me my friend

we wait for certain money here sir

ay
if money were as certain as your waiting
'Twere sure enough
why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills
when your false masters eat of my lord's meat
then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
and take down the interest into their gluttonous maws
you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
let me pass quietly
believe't my lord and I have made an end
I have no more to reckon he to spend

ay but this answer will not serve

if twill not serve tis not so base as you


how what does his cashiered worship mutter

no matter what he's poor and that's revenge enough Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in such may rail against great buildings


O here's Servilius now we shall know some answer

if I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much from t for take t of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has forsook him he's much out of health and keeps his chamber

many do keep their chambers are not sick
and if it be so far beyond his health
methinks he should the sooner pay his debts
and make a clear way to the gods

good gods

we cannot take this for answer sir
Servilius help my lord my lord


what are my doors oppos'd against my passage
have I been ever free and must my house
be my retentive enemy my gaol
the place which I have feasted does it now
like all mankind show me an iron heart

put in now Titus

my lord here is my bill

here's mine

and mine my lord

and ours my lord


knock me down with em cleave me to the girdle

alas my lord

cut my heart in sums

mine fifty talents

tell out my blood

five thousand crowns my lord

five thousand drops pays that What yours and yours

my lord

my lord



faith I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money these debts may well be called desperate ones for a madman owes em

they have e'en put my breath from me the slaves
creditors devils

my dear lord

what if it should be so

my lord

I'll have it so My steward

here my lord

so fitly Go bid all my friends again
Lucius Lucullus and Sempronius all

O my lord
you only speak from your distracted soul
there is not so much left to furnish out
a moderate table

be't not in thy care go
I charge thee invite them all let in the tide
of knaves once more my cook and I'll provide


my lord you have my voice to it the fault's
bloody tis necessary he should die
nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy

most true the law shall bruise him


honour health and compassion to the senate
now captain

I am a humble suitor to your virtues
for pity is the virtue of the law
and none but tyrants use it cruelly
it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
upon a friend of mine who in hot blood
hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth
to those that without heed to plunge into t
he is a man setting his fate aside
of comely virtues
nor did he soil the fact with cowardice
an honour in him which buys out his fault
but with a noble fury and fair spirit
seeing his reputation touch'd to death
he did oppose his foe
and with such sober and unnoted passion
he did behave his anger ere twas spent
as if he had but prov'd an argument
you undergo too strict a paradox
striving to make an ugly deed look fair
your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
upon the head of valour which indeed
is valour misbegot and came into the world
when sects and factions were newly born
he's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs
his outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly
and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart
to bring it into danger
if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
what folly tis to hazard life for ill

my lord

you cannot make gross sins look clear
to revenge is no valour but to bear
my lords then under favour pardon me
if I speak like a captain
why do fond men expose themselves to battle
and not endure all threats sleep upon't
and let the foes quietly cut their throats
without repugnancy If there be
such valour in the bearing what make we
abroad why then women are more valiant
that stay at home if bearing carry it
and the ass more captain than the lion the felon
loaden with irons wiser than the judge
if wisdom be in suffering O my lords
as you are great be pitifully good
who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
to kill I grant is sin's extremest gust
but in defence by mercy tis most just
to be in anger is impiety
but who is man that is not angry
weigh but the crime with this
you breathe in vain

in vain his service done
at Laced mon and Byzantium
were a sufficient briber for his life

what's that

I say my lords he has done fair service
and slain in fight many of your enemies
how full of valour did he bear himself
in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds

he has made too much plenty with em
he's a sworn rioter he has a sin that often
drowns him and takes his valour prisoner
if there were no foes that were enough
to overcome him in that beastly fury
he has been known to commit outrages
his days are foul and his drink dangerous

he dies

hard fate he might have died in war
my lords if not for any parts in him
though his right arm might purchase his own time
and be in debt to none yet more to move you
take my deserts to his and join em both
and for I know your reverend ages love
security I'll pawn my victories all
my honour to you upon his good returns
if by this crime he owes the law his life
why let the war receive't in valiant gore
for law is strict and war is nothing more

we are for law he dies urge it no more
on height of our displeasure Friend or brother
he forfeits his own blood that spills another
must it be so it must not be My lords
I do beseech you know me

how

call me to your remembrances

what

I cannot think but your age has forgot me
it could not else be I should prove so base
to sue and be denied such common grace
my wounds ache at you

do you dare our anger
'Tis in few words but spacious in effect
we banish thee for ever

banish me
that makes the senate ugly

if after two days' shine Athens contain thee
attend our weightier judgment And not to swell our spirit
he shall be executed presently


now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
only in bone that none may look on you
I am worse than mad I have kept back their foes
while they have told their money and let out
their coin upon large interest I myself
rich only in large hurts all those for this
is this the balsam that the usuring senate
pours into captains' wounds Banishment
it comes not ill I hate not to be banish'd
it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
that I may strike at Athens I'll cheer up
my discontented troops and lay for hearts
soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods

the good time of day to you sir

I also wish it you I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day

upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends

it should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting

I should think so he hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and I must needs appear

in like manner was I in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse I am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out

I am sick of that grief too as I understand how all things go

every man here's so What would he have borrowed you

a thousand pieces
a thousand pieces

what of you

he sent to me sir Here he comes


with all my heart gentlemen both and how fare you

ever at the best hearing well of your lordship

the swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship

nor more willingly leaves winter such summer-birds are men Gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long stay feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so harshly o' the trumpet's sound we shall to t presently

I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messenger

O sir let it not trouble you


Ah my good friend what cheer

my most honourable lord I am e'en sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggar

think not on t sir

if you had sent but two hours before

let it not cumber your better remembrance

come bring in all together

all covered dishes

royal cheer I warrant you

doubt not that if money and the season can yield it


Alcibiades is banished hear you of it

Alcibiades banished

Alcibiades banished

'Tis so be sure of it

how how

I pray you upon what

my worthy friends will you draw near

I'll tell you more anon Here's a noble feast toward

this is the old man still


it does but time will and so

I do conceive

each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all places alike Make not a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place sit sit The gods require our thanks
you great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness For your own gifts make yourselves praised but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised Lend to each man enough that one need not lend to another for were your godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains if there sit twelve women at the table let a dozen of them be as they are The rest of your fees O gods the senators of Athens together with the common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make suitable for destruction For these my present friends as they are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are they welcome
uncover dogs and lap


what does his lordship mean

I know not

may you a better feast never behold
you knot of mouth-friends smoke and lukewarm water
is your perfection This is Timon's last
who stuck and spangled with your flatteries
washes it off and sprinkles in your faces
your reeking villany Live loath'd and long
most smiling smooth detested parasites
courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears
you fools of fortune trencher-friends time's flies
cap and knee slaves vapours and minute-jacks
of man and beast the infinite malady
crust you quite o'er What dost thou go
soft take thy physic first thou too and thou
stay I will lend thee money borrow none

what all in motion Henceforth be no feast
whereat a villain's not a welcome guest
burn house sink Athens henceforth hated be
of Timon man and all humanity

how now my lords

know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury


I have lost my gown

he's but a mad lord and nought but humour sways him He gave me a jewel th' other day and now he has beat it out of my hat did you see my jewel

did you see my cap

here tis

here lies my gown

let's make no stay

lord Timon's mad

I feel t upon my bones

one day he gives us diamonds next day stones

that girdlest in those wolves dive in the earth
and fence not Athens Matrons turn incontinent
obedience fail in children slaves and fools
pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench
and minister in their steads To general filths
convert o'the instant green virginity
do't in your parents' eyes Bankrupts hold fast
rather than render back out with your knives
and cut your trusters' throats Bound servants steal
large-handed robbers your grave masters are
and pill by law Maid to thy master's bed
thy mistress is o' the brothel Son of sixteen
pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire
with it beat out his brains Piety and fear
religion to the gods peace justice truth
domestic awe night-rest and neighbourhood
instruction manners mysteries and trades
degrees observances customs and laws
decline to your confounding contraries
your potent and infectious fevers heap
on Athens ripe for stroke Thou cold sciatica
cripple our senators that their limbs may halt
as lamely as their manners Lust and liberty
creep in the minds and marrows of our youth
that'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive
and drown themselves in riot Itches blains
sow all the Athenian bosoms and their crop
be general leprosy Breath infect breath
that their society as their friendship may
be merely poison Nothing I'll bear from thee
but nakedness thou detestable town
take thou that too with multiplying bans
Timon will to the woods where he shall find
the unkindest beast more kinder than mankind
the gods confound hear me you good gods all
the Athenians both within and out that wall
and grant as Timon grows his hate may grow
to the whole race of mankind high and low


hear you Master steward where's our master
are we undone cast off nothing remaining

alack my fellows what should I say to you
let me be recorded by the righteous gods
I am as poor as you

such a house broke
so noble a master fall'n All gone and not
one friend to take his fortune by the arm
and go along with him

as we do turn our backs
from our companion thrown into his grave
so his familiars to his buried fortunes
slink all away leave their false vows with him
like empty purses pick'd and his poor self
with his disease of all-shunn'd poverty
walks like contempt alone More of our fellows


all broken implements of a ruin'd house

yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery
that see I by our faces we are fellows still
serving alike in sorrow Leak'd is our bark
and we poor mates stand on the dying deck
hearing the surges threat we must all part
into this sea of air

good fellows all
the latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you
wherever we shall meet for Timon's sake
let's yet be fellows let's shake our heads and say
as twere a knell unto our master's fortunes
'We have seen better days Let each take some
nay put out all your hands Not one word more
thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor

O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
since riches point to misery and contempt
who would be so mock'd with glory or so live
but in a dream of friendship
to have his pomp and all what state compounds
but only painted like his varnish'd friends
poor honest lord brought low by his own heart
undone by goodness Strange unusual blood
when man's worst sin is he does too much good
who then dares to be half so kind agen
for bounty that makes gods does still mar men
my dearest lord bless'd to be most accurs'd
rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes
are made thy chief affictions Alas kind lord
he's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
nor has he with him to supply his life
or that which can command it
I'll follow and inquire him out
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will
whilst I have gold I'll be his steward still


O blessed breeding sun draw from the earth
rotten humidity below thy sister's orb
infect the air Twinn'd brothers of one womb
whose procreation residence and birth
scarce is dividant touch them with several fortunes
the greater scorns the lesser not nature
to whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune
but by contempt of nature
raise me this beggar and deny't that lord
the senator shall bear contempt hereditary
the beggar native honour
it is the pasture lards the rother's sides
in purity of manhood stand upright
and say This man's a flatterer if one be
so are they all for every grize of fortune
is smooth'd by that below the learned pate
ducks to the golden fool all is oblique
there's nothing level in our cursed natures
but direct villany Therefore be abhorr'd
all feasts societies and throngs of men
his semblable yea himself Timon disdains
destruction fang mankind Earth yield me roots

who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate
with thy most operant poison What is here
gold yellow glittering precious gold No gods
I am no idle votarist Roots you clear heavens
thus much of this will make black white foul fair
wrong right base noble old young coward valiant
ha you gods why this What this you gods Why this
will lug your priests and servants from your sides
this yellow slave
will knit and breah religions bless the accurs'd
make the hoar leprosy ador'd place thieves
and give them title knee and approbation
with senators on the bench this is it
that makes the wappen'd widow wed again
she whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices
to the April day again Come damned earth
thou common whore of mankind that putt'st odds
among the rout of nations I will make thee
do thy right nature

ha a drum thou'rt quick
but yet I'll bury thee thou'lt go strong theif
when gouty keepers of thee cannot stand
nay stay thou out for earnest

what art thou there speak
a beast as thou art The canker gnaw thy heart
for showing me again the eyes of man

what is thy name Is man so hateful to thee
that art thyself a man

I am Misanthropos and hate mankind
for thy part I do wish thou wert a dog
that I might love thee something

I know thee well
but in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange

I know thee too and more than that I know thee
I not desire to know Follow thy drum
with man's blood paint the ground gules gules
religious canons civil laws are cruel
then what should war be This fell whore of thine
hath in her more destruction than thy sword

thy lips rot off

I will not kiss thee then the rot returns
to thine own lips again

how came the noble Timon to this change

as the moon does by wanting light to give
but then renew I could not like the moon
there were no suns to borrow of

noble Timon what friendship may I do thee

none but to maintain my opinion

what is it Timon

promise me friendship but perform none if thou wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art a man if thou dost perform confound thee for thou art a man
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries

thou saw'st them when I had prosperity

I see them now then was a blessed time

as thine is now held with a brace of harlots

is this the Athenian minion whom the world
voic'd so regardfully

art thou Timandra

yes

be a whore still they love thee not that use thee
give them diseases leaving with thee their lust
make use of thy salt hours season the slaves
for tubs and baths bring down rose-cheeked youth

hang thee monster

pardon him sweet Timandra for his wits
are drown'd and lost in his calamities
I have but little gold of late brave Timon
the want whereof doth daily make revolt
in my penurious band I have heard and griev'd
how cursed Athens mindless of thy worth
forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states
but for thy sword and fortune trod upon them

I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone

I am thy friend and pity thee dear Timon

how dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble
I had rather be alone

here is some gold for thee

keep it I cannot eat it

when I have laid proud Athens on a heap

warr'st thou gainst Athens

ay Timon and have cause

the gods confound them all in thy conquest and
thee after when thou hast conquer'd

why me Timon

that by killing of villains thou wast born to conquer
my country
put up thy gold go on here's gold go on
be as a planetary plague when Jove
in the sick air let not thy sword skip one
pity not honour'd age for his white beard
he is a usurer Strike me the counterfeit matron
it is her habit only that is honest
herself's a bawd Let not the virgin's cheek
make soft thy trenchant sword for those milkpaps
that through the window-bars bore at men's eyes
are not within the leaf of pity writ
but set them down horrible traitors Spare not the babe
whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy
think it a bastard whom the oracle
hath doubtfully pronounc'd thy throat shall cut
and mince it sans remorse Swear against objects
put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes
whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes
nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding
shall pierce a jot There's gold to pay thy soldiers
make large confusion and thy fury spent
confounded be thyself Speak not be gone
hast thou gold yet I'll take the gold thou giv'st me
not all thy counsel

dost thou or dost thou not heaven's curse upon thee

give us some gold good Timon hast thou more

give us some gold good Timon hast thou more

enough to make a whore forswear her trade
and to make whores a bawd Hold up you sluts
your aprons mountant you are not oathable
although I know you'll swear terribly swear
into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
the immortal gods that hear you spare your oaths
I'll trust to your conditions be whores still
and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you
be strong in whore allure him burn him up
let your close fire predominate his smoke
be quite contrary and thatch your poor thin roofs
with burdens of the dead some that were hang'd
no matter wear them betray with them whore still
paint till a horse may mire upon your face
a pox of wrinkles

well more gold What then

well more gold What then
believe't that we'll do anything for gold

consumptions sow
in hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins
and mar men's spurring Crack the lawyer's voice
that he may never more false title plead
nor sound his quillets shrilly hoar the flamen
that scolds against the quality of flesh
and not believes himself down with the nose
down with it flat take the bridge quite away
smells from the general weal make curl'd-pate ruffians bald
and let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
derive some pain from you plague all
that your activity may defeat and quell
the source of all erection There's more gold
do you damn others and let this damn you
and ditches grave you all

more counsel with more money bounteous Timon

more counsel with more money bounteous Timon

more whore more mischief first I have given you earnest

strike up the drum towards Athens Farewell Timon
if I thrive well I'll visit thee again

if I hope well I'll never see thee more


yes thou spok'st well of me

call'st thou that harm

men daily find it Get thee away and take
thy beagles with thee

we but offend him Strike


that nature being sick of man's unkindness
should yet be hungry Common mother thou

whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
teams and feeds all whose self-same mettle
whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff'd
engenders the black toad and adder blue
the gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm
whareon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine
yield him who all thy human sons doth hate
from forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root
ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb
let it no more bring out ingrateful man
go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears
teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
hath to the marbled mansion all above
never presented O a root dear thanks
dry up thy marrows vines and plough-torn leas
whereof ingrateful man with liquorish draughts
and morsels unctuous greases his pure mind
that from it all consideration slips

more man Plague plague

I was directed hither men report
thou dost affect my manners and dost use them

whom I would imitate consumption catch thee

this is in thee a nature but infected
a poor unmanly melancholy sprung
from change of fortune Why this spade this place
this slave-like habit and these looks of care
thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft
hug their diseas'd perfumes and have forgot
that ever Timon was Shame not these woods
by putting on the cunning of a carper
be thou a flatterer now and seak to thrive
by that which has undone thee hinge thy knee
and let his very breath whom thou'lt observe
blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain
and call it excellent Thou wast told thus
thou gav'st thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
to knaves and all approachers tis most just
that thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again
rascals should have't Do not assume my likeness
were I like thee I'd throw away myself

thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself
a madman so long now a fool What think'st
that the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain
will put thy shirt on warm will these moss'd trees
that have outliv'd the eagle page thy heels
and skip when thou point'st out will the cold brook
candied with ice caudle thy morning taste
to cure the o'er-night's surfeit Call the creatures
whose naked natures live in all the spite
of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks
to the conflicting elements expos'd
answer mere nature bid them flatter thee
O thou shalt find

a fool of thee Depart

I love thee better now than e'er I did
I hate thee worse

why

thou flatter'st misery

I flatter not but say thou art a caitiff

why dost thou seek me out

to vex thee

always a villain's office or a fool's
dost please thyself in t

ay

what a knave too

to castigate thy pride twere well but thou
dost it enforcedly thou'dst courtier be again
wert thou not beggar Willing misery
outlives incertain pomp is crown'd before
the one is filling still never complete
the other at high wish best state contentless
hath a distracted and most wretched being
worse than the worst content
thou shouldst desire to die being miserable

not by his breath that is more miserable
thou art a slave whom Fortune's tender arm
with favour never clasp'd but bred a dog
hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
the sweet degrees that this brief world affords
to such as may the passive drudges of it
freely command thou wouldst have plung'd thyself
in general riot melted down thy youth
in different beds of lust and never learn'd
the sugar'd game before thee But myself
who had the world as my confectionary
the mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men
at duty more than I could frame employment
that numberless upon me stuck as leaves
do on the oak have with one winter's brush
fell from their boughs and left me open bare
for every storm that blows I to bear this
that never knew but better is some burden
thy nature did commence in sufferance time
hath made thee hard in t Why shouldst thou hate men
they never flatter'd thee what hast thou given
if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag
must be thy subject who in spite put stuff
to some she beggar and compounded thee
poor rogue hereditary Hence be gone
if thou hadst not been born the worst of men
thou hadst been a knave and flatterer


ay that I am not thee

I that I was
no prodigal

I that I am one now
were all the wealth I have shut up in thee
I'd give thee leave to hang it Get thee gone
that the whole life of Athens were in this
thus would I eat it


here I will mend thy feast

first mend my company take away thyself

so I shall mend mine own by the lack of thine

if not I would it were

what wouldst thou have to Athens

thee thither in a whirlwind If thou wilt
tell them there I have gold look so I have

here is no use for gold

the best and truest
for here it sleeps and does no hired harm

where liest o' nights Timon

under that's above me
where feed'st thou o' days Apemantus

where my stomach finds meat or rather where I eat it


where wouldst thou send it

to sauce thy dishes

the middle of humanity thou never knewest but the extremity of both ends When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume they mocked thee for too much curiosity in thy rags thou knowest none but art despised for the contrary There's a medlar for thee eat it

on what I hate I feed not

dost hate a medlar

ay though it look like thee

an thou hadst hated meddlers sooner thou shouldst have loved thyself better now What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means

who without those means thou talkest of didst thou ever know beloved

myself


what things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers

women nearest but men men are the things themselves What wouldst thou do with the world Apemantus if it lay in thy power

give it the beasts to be rid of the men

wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts

ay Timon

a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee to attain to If thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence What beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast and what a beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation

if thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou mightst have hit upon it here the commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts

how has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city

yonder comes a poet and a painter the plague of company light upon thee I will fear to catch it and give way When I know not what else to do I'll see thee again


thou art the cap of all the fools alive

would thou wert clean enough to spit upon

a plague on thee thou art too bad to curse

all villains that do stand by thee are pure

there is no leprosy but what thou speak'st

if I name thee
I'll beat thee but I should infect my hands

I would my tongue could rot them off

away thou issue of a mangy dog
choler does kill me that thou art alive
I swound to see thee
would thou wouldst burst

away
thou tedious rogue I am sorry I shall lose
a stone by thee


beast

slave

toad

rogue rogue rogue
I am sick of this false world and will love nought
but even the mere necessities upon t
then Timon presently prepare thy grave
lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
thy grave-stone daily make thine epitaph

O thou sweet king-killer and dear divorce
'Twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler
of Hymen's purest bed thou valiant Mars
thou ever young fresh lov'd and delicate wooer
whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
that lies on Dian's lap thou visible god
that solder'st close impossibilities
and mak'st them kiss that speak'st with every tongue
to every purpose O thou touch of hearts
think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue
set them into confounding odds that beasts
may have the world in empire

would twere so
but not till I am dead I'll say thou'st gold
thou wilt be throng'd to shortly

throng'd to
ay

thy back I prithee

live and love thy misery

long live so and so die

I am quit
more things like men Eat Timon and abhor them


where should he have this gold It is some poor fragment some slender ort of his remainder The mere want of gold and the falling-from of his friends drove him into this melancholy

it is noised he hath a mass of treasure

let us make the assay upon him if he care not for t he will supply us easily if he covetously reserve it how shall's get it

true for he bears it not about him tis hid
is not this he

where

'Tis his description

he I know him

save thee Timon

now thieves

soldiers not thieves

both too and women's sons

we are not thieves but men that much do want

your greatest want is you want much of meat
within this mile break forth a hundred springs
the oaks bear mast the briers scarlet hips
the bounteous housewife nature on each bush
lays her full mess before you Want why want

we cannot live on grass on berries water
as beasts and birds and fishes

nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes
you must eat men Yet thanks I must you con
that you are thieves profess'd that you work not
in holier shapes for there is boundless theft
in limited professions Rascal thieves
here's gold Go suck the subtle blood o' the grape
till the high fever seethe your blood to froth
and so scape hanging trust not the physician
his antidotes are poison and he slays
more than you rob take wealth and lives together
do villany do since you protest to do't
the sun's a thief and with his great attraction
robs the vast sea the moon's an arrant thief
and her pale fire she snatches from the sun
the sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves
the moon into salt tears the earth's a thief
that feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
from general excrement each thing's a thief
the laws your curb and whip in their rough power
have uncheck'd theft Love not yourselves away
rob one another There's more gold cut throats
all that you meet are thieves To Athens go
break open shops nothing can you steal
but thieves do lose it steal no less for this
I give you and gold confound you howsoe'er
amen

he has almost charmed me from my profession by persuading me to it

'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us not to have us thrive in our mystery
I'll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade

let us first see peace in Athens there is no time so miserable but a man may be true

O you gods
is yond despised and ruinous man my lord
full of decay and failing O monument
and wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd
what an alteration of honour
has desperate want made
what viler thing upon the earth than friends
who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
how rarely does it meet with this time's guise
when man was wish'd to love his enemies
grant I may ever love and rather woo
those that would mischief me than those that do
he hath caught me in his eye I will present
my honest grief unto him and as my lord
still serve him with my life My dearest master

away what art thou

have you forgot me sir

why dost ask that I have forgot all men
then if thou grant'st thou'rt a man I have forgot thee

an honest poor servant of yours

then I know thee not
I never had an honest man about me ay all
I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains

the gods are witness
ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
for his undone lord than mine eyes for you

what dost thou weep Come nearer Then I love thee
flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
but thorough lust and laughter Pity's sleeping
strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping

I beg of you to know me good my lord
to accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
to entertain me as your steward still

had I a steward
so true so just and now so comfortable
it almost turns my dangerous nature mild
let me behold thy face Surely this man
was born of woman
forgive my general and exceptless rashness
you perpetual sober gods I do proclaim
one honest man mistake me not but one
no more I pray and he's a steward
how fain would I have hated all mankind
and thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee
methinks thou art more honest now than wise
for by oppressing and betraying me
thou mightst have sooner got another service
for many so arrive at second masters
upon their first lord's neck But tell me true
for I must ever doubt though ne'er so sure
is not thy kindness subtle covetous
if not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts
expecting in return twenty for one

no my most worthy master in whose breast
doubt and suspect alas are plac'd too late
you should have fear'd false times when you did feast
suspect still comes when an estate is least
that which I show heaven knows is merely love
duty and zeal to your unmatched mind
care of your food and living and believe it
my most honour'd lord
for any benefit that points to me
for this one wish that you had power and wealth
to requite me by making rich yourself

look thee tis so Thou singly honest man
here take the gods out of my misery
have sent thee treasure Go live rich and happy
but thus condition'd thou shalt build from men
hate all curse all show charity to none
but let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone
ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs
what thou deny'st to men let prisons swallow em
debts wither em to nothing be men like blasted woods
and may diseases lick up their false bloods
and so farewell and thrive

O let me stay
and comfort you my master

if thou hatest
ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee

as I took note of the place it cannot be far where he abides

what's to be thought of him Does the rumour hold for true that he is so full of gold

certain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum

then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends

nothing else you shall see him a palm in Athens again and flourish with the highest Therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travel for if it be a just and true report that goes of his having

what have you now to present unto him

nothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent piece

I must serve him so too tell him of an intent that's coming towards him

good as the best Promising is the very air o' the time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it

excellent workman Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself

I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him it must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency

must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men Do so I have gold for thee

nay let's seek him
then do we sin against our own estate
when we may profit meet and come too late

true
when the day serves before black-corner'd night
find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light
come

I'll meet you at the turn What a god's gold
that he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
than where swine feed
settlest admired reverence in a slave
to thee be worship and thy saints for aye
be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey
fit I meet them


hail worthy Timon

our late noble master

have I once liv'd to see two honest men

sir
having often of your open bounty tasted
hearing you were retir'd your friends fall'n off
whose thankless natures O abhorred spirits
not all the whips of heaven are large enough
what to you
whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
with any size of words

let it go naked men may see t the better
you that are honest by being what you are
make them best seen and known

he and myself
have travell'd in the great shower of your gifts
and sweetly felt it

ay you are honest men

we are hither come to offer you our service

most honest men Why how shall I requite you
can you eat roots and drink cold water no

what we can do we'll do to do you service
ye're honest men Ye've heard that I have gold
I am sure you have speak truth ye're honest men

so it is said my noble lord but therefore
came not my friend nor I

good honest men Thou draw'st a counterfeit
best in all Athens thou'rt indeed the best
thou counterfeit'st most lively

so so my lord

e'en so sir as I say And for thy fiction
why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
that thou art even natural in thine art
but for all this my honest-natur'd friends
I must needs say you have a little fault
marry tis not monstrous in you neither wish I
you take much pains to mend
beseech your honour
to make it known to us

you'll take it ill

most thankfully my lord

will you indeed

doubt it not worthy lord

there's never a one of you but trusts a knave
that mightily deceives you

do we my lord

ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble
know his gross patchery love him feed him
keep in your bosom yet remain assur'd

I know none such my lord

nor I

look you I love you well I'll give you gold
rid me these villains from your companies
hang them or stab them drown them in a draught
confound them by some course and come to me
I'll give you gold enough

name them my lord let's know them

you that way and you this but two in company
each man apart all single and alone
yet an arch villain keeps him company
if where thou art two villains shall not be
come not near him

but where one villain is then him abandon
hence pack there's gold ye came for gold ye slaves
you have done work for me there's payment hence
you are an alchemist make gold of that
out rascal dogs

it is in vain that you would speak with Timon
for he is set so only to himself
that nothing but himself which looks like man
is friendly with him

bring us to his cave
it is our part and promise to the Athenians
to speak with Timon

at all times alike
men are not still the same twas time and griefs
that fram'd him thus time with his fairer hand
offering the fortunes of his former days
and chance it as it may

here is his cave
peace and content be here Lord Timon Timon
look out and speak to friends The Athenians
by two of their most reverend senate greet thee
speak to them noble Timon


thousun that comfort'st burn Speak and be hang'd
for each true word a blister and each false
be as a cauterizing to the root o'the tongue
consuming it with speaking

worthy Timon

of none but such as you and you of Timon

the senators of Athens greet thee Timon
I thank them and would send them back the plague
could I but catch it for them

O forget
what we are sorry for ourselves in thee
the senators with one consent of love
entreat thee back to Athens who have thought
on special dignities which vacant lie
for thy best use and wearing

they confess
toward thee forgetfulness to general gross
which now the public body which doth seldom
play the recanter feeling in itself
a lack of Timon's aid hath sense withal
of its own fail restraining aid to Timon
and send forth us to make their sorrow'd render
together with a recompense more fruitful
than their offence can weigh down by the dram
as shall to thee block out what wrongs were theirs
and write in thee the figures of their love
ever to read them thine

you witch me in it
surprise me to the very brink of tears
lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes
and I'll beweep these comforts worthy senators

therefore so please thee to return with us
and of our Athens thine and ours to take
the captainship thou shalt be met with thanks
allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
live with authority so soon we shall drive back
of Alcibiades the approaches wild
who like a boar too savage doth root up
his country's peace

and shakes his threat'ning sword

therefore Timon

well sir I will therefore I will sir thus
if Alcibiades kill my countrymen
let Alcibiades know this of Timon
that Timon cares not But if he sack fair Athens
and take our goodly aged men by the beards
giving our holy virgins to the stain
of contumelious beastly mad-brain'd war
then let him know and tell him Timon speaks it
in pity of our aged and our youth
I cannot choose but tell him that I care not
and let him take't at worst for their knives care not
while you have throats to answer for myself
there's not a whittle in the unruly camp
but I do prize it at my love before
the reverend'st throat in Athens So I leave you
to the protection of the prosperous gods

stay not all's in vain

why I was writing of my epitaph
it will be seen to-morrow My long sickness
of health and living now begins to mend
and nothing brings me all things Go live still
be Alcibiades your plague you his
and last so long enough

we speak in vain

but yet I love my country and am not
one that rejoices in the common wrack
as common bruit doth put it

that's well spoke

commend me to my loving countrymen
these words become your lips as they pass through them

and enter in our ears like great triumphers
in their applauding gates

commend me to them
and tell them that to ease them of their griefs
their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses
their pangs of love with other incident throes
that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
in life's uncertain voyage I will some kindness do them
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath

I like this well he will return again

I have a tree which grows here in my close
that mine own use invites me to cut down
and shortly must I fell it tell my friends
tell Athens in the sequence of degree
to stop affliction let him take his haste
come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe
and hang himself I pray you do my greeting

trouble him no further thus you still shall find him

come not to me again but say to Athans
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
upon the beached verge of the salt flood
who once a day with his embossed froth
the turbulent surge shall cover thither come
and let my grave-stone be your oracle
lips let sour words go by and language end
what is amiss plague and infection mend
graves only be men's works and death their gain
sun hide thy beams Timon hath done his reign


his discontents are unremovably Coupled to nature
our hope in him is dead let us return
and strain what other means is left unto us
in our dear peril

it requires swift foot


thou hast painfully discover'd are his files
as full as thy report

I have spoke the least
besides his expedition promises
present approach

we stand much hazard if they bring not Timon

I met a courier one mine ancient friend
whom though in general part we were oppos'd
yet our old love made a particular force
from Alcibiades to Timon's cave
with letters of entreaty which imported
his fellowship i' the cause against your city
in part for his sake mov'd

here come our brothers


no talk of Timon nothing of him expect
the enemies' drum is heard and fearful scouring
doth choke the air with dust In and prepare
ours is the fall I fear our foes the snare


by all description this should be the place
who's here speak ho No answer What is this
Timon is dead who hath outstretch'd his span
some beast rear'd this here does not live a man
dead sure and this his grave What's on this tomb
our captain hath in every figure skill
an ag'd interpreter though young in days
before proud Athens he's set down by this
whose fall the mark of his ambition is


sound to this coward and lascivious town
our terrible approach

till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
with all licentious measure making your wills
the scope of justice till now myself and such
as slept within the shadow of your power
have wander'd with our travers'd arms and breath'd
our sufferance vainly Now the time is flush
when crouching marrow in the bearer strong
cries of itself No more now breathless wrong
shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
and pursy insolence shall break his wind
with fear and horrid flight

noble and young
when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit
ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear
we sent to thee to give thy rages balm
to wipe out our ingratitude with loves
above their quantity

so did we woo
transformed Timon to our city's love
by humble message and by promis'd means
we were not all unkind nor all deserve
the common stroke of war

these walls of ours
were not erected by their hands from whom
you have receiv'd your grief nor are they such
that these great towers trophies and schools should fall

nor are they living
who were the motives that you first went out
shame that they wanted cunning in excess
hath broke their hearts March noble lord
into our city with thy banners spread
by decimation and a tithed death
if thy revenges hunger for that food
which nature loathes take thou the destin'd tenth
and by the hazard of the spotted die
let die the spotted

all have not offended
for those that were it is not square to take
on those that are revenges crimes like lands
are not inherited Then dear countryman
bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage
spare thyAthenian cradle and those kin
which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
approach the fold and cull th' infected forth
but kill not all together

what thou wilt
thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
thank hew to't with thy sword

set but thy foot
against our rampir'd gates and they shall ope
so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
to say thou'lt enter friendly

throw thy glove
or any token of thine honour else
that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
and not as our confusion all thy powers
shall make their harbour in our town till we
have seal'd thy full desire

descend and open your uncharged ports
those enemies of Timon's and mine own
whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
fall and no more and to atone your fears
with my more noble meaning not a man
shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
of regular justice in your city's bounds
but shall be render'd to your public laws
at heaviest answer

'Tis most nobly spoken

descend and keep your words

my noble general Timon is dead
entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea
and on his grave-stone this insculpture which
with wax I brought away whose soft impression
interprets for my poor ignorance
here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft
seek not my name a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left
here lie I Timon who alive all living men did hate
pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy gait
these well express in thee thy latter spirits
though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs
scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which
from niggard nature fall yet rich conceit
taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
on thy low grave on faults forgiven Dead
is noble Timon of whose memory
hereafter more Bring me into your city
and I will use the olive with my sword
make war breed peace make peace stint war make each
prescribe to other as each other's leech
let our drums strike

TITUS ANDRONICUS

noble patricians patrons of my right
defend the justice of my cause with arms
and countrymen my loving followers
plead my successive title with your swords
I am his first-born son that was the last
that wore the imperial diadem of Rome
then let my father's honours live in me
nor wrong mine age with this indignity

Romans friends followers favourers of my right
if ever Bassianus C sar's son
were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome
keep then this passage to the Capitol
and suffer not dishonour to approach
the imperial seat to virtue consecrate
to justice continence and nobility
but let desert in pure election shine
and Romans fight for freedom in your choice

princes that strive by factions and by friends
ambitiously for rule and empery
know that the people of Rome for whom we stand
a special party have by common voice
in election for the Roman empery
chosen Andronicus surnamed Pius
for many good and great deserts to Rome
a nobler man a braver warrior
lives not this day within the city walls
he by the senate is accited home
from weary wars against the barbarous Goths
that with his sons a terror to our foes
hath yok'd a nation strong train'd up in arms
ten years are spent since first he undertook
this cause of Rome and chastised with arms
our enemies' pride five times he hath return'd
bleeding to Rome bearing his valiant sons
in coffins from the field
and now at last laden with honour's spoils
renowned Titus flourishing in arms
let us entreat by honour of his name
whom worthily you would have now succeed
and in the Capitol and senate's right
whom you pretend to honour and adore
that you withdraw you and abate your strength
dismiss your followers and as suitors should
plead your deserts in peace and humbleness

how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts

Marcus Andronicus so I do affy
in thy uprightness and integrity
and so I love and honour thee and thine
thy noble brother Titus and his sons
and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all
gracious Lavinia Rome's rich ornament
that I will here dismiss my loving friends
and to my fortunes and the people's favour


friends that have been thus forward in my right
I thank you all and here dismiss you all
and to the love and favour of my country
commit myself my person and the cause

Rome be as just and gracious unto me
as I am confident and kind to thee
open the gates and let me in

tribunes and me a poor competitor

Romans make way the good Andronicus
patron of virtue Rome's best champion
successful in the battles that he fights
with honour and with fortune is return'd
from where he circumscribed with his sword
and brought to yoke the enemies of Rome
hail Rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
lo as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
returns with precious lading to the bay
from whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage
cometh Andronicus bound with laurel boughs
to re-salute his country with his tears
tears of true joy for his return to Rome
thou great defender of this Capitol
stand gracious to the rites that we intend
Romans of five-and-twenty valiant sons
half of the number that King Priam had
behold the poor remains alive and dead
these that survive let Rome reward with love
these that I bring unto their latest home
with burial among their ancestors
here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword
Titus unkind and careless of thine own
why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet
to hover on the dreadful shore of Styx

there greet in silence as the dead are wont
and sleep in peace slain in your country's wars
O sacred receptacle of my joys
sweet cell of virtue and nobility
how many sons of mine hast thou in store
that thou wilt never render to me more

give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths
that we may hew his limbs and on a pile
ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
before this earthy prison of their bones
that so the shadows be not unappeas'd
nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth

I give him you the noblest that survives
the eldest son of this distressed queen

stay Roman brethren Gracious conqueror
a mother's tears in passion for her son
and if thy sons were ever dear to thee
O think my son to be as dear to me
sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
to beautify thy triumphs and return
captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke
but must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets
for valiant doings in their country's cause
O if to fight for king and commonweal
were piety in thine it is in these
Andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood
wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
draw near them then in being merciful
sweet mercy is nobility's true badge
thrice-noble Titus spare my first-born son

patient yourself madam and pardon me
these are their brethren whom your Goths beheld
alive and dead and for their brethren slain
to this your son is mark'd and die he must
to appease their groaning shadows that are gone

away with him and make a fire straight
and with our swords upon a pile of wood
let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd


O cruel irreligious piety

was ever Scythia half so barbarous

oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome
alarbus goes to rest and we survive
to tremble under Titus' threatening look
then madam stand resolv'd but hope withal
the self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
with opportunity of sharp revenge
upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
when Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen
to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes


see lord and father how we have perform'd
our Roman rites Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd
and entrails feed the sacrificing fire
whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky
remaineth nought but to inter our brethren
and with loud larums welcome them to Rome

let it be so and let Andronicus
make this his latest farewell to their souls

in peace and honour rest you here my sons
Rome's readiest champions repose you here in rest
secure from worldly chances and mishaps
here lurks no treason here no envy swells
here grow no damned drugs here are no storms
in peace and honour rest you here my sons


in peace and honour live Lord Titus long
my noble lord and father live in fame
lo at this tomb my tributary tears
I render for my brethren's obsequies
and at thy feet I kneel with tears of joy
shed on the earth for thy return to Rome
O bless me here with thy victorious hand
whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud

kind Rome that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
the cordial of mine age to glad my heart
Lavinia live outlive thy father's days
and fame's eternal date for virtue's praise


long live Lord Titus my beloved brother

thanks gentle Tribune noble brother Marcus

and welcome nephews from successful wars
you that survive and you that sleep in fame
fair lords your fortunes are alike in all
that in your country's service drew your swords
but safer triumph is this funeral pomp
that hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness
and triumphs over chance in honour's bed
Titus Andronicus the people of Rome
whose friend in justice thou hast ever been
send thee by me their tribune and their trust
this palliament of white and spotless hue
and name thee in election for the empire
with these our late-deceased emperor's sons
be candidatus then and put it on
and help to set a head on headless Rome

than his that shakes for age and feebleness
what should I don this robe and trouble you
be chosen with proclamations to-day
to-morrow yield up rule resign my life
and set abroad new business for you all
Rome I have been thy soldier forty years
and led my country's strength successfully
and buried one-and-twenty valiant sons
knighted in field slain manfully in arms
in right and service of their noble country
give me a staff of honour for mine age
but not a sceptre to control the world
upright he held it lords that held it last

Titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery

proud and ambitious tribune canst thou tell

patience Prince Saturninus
Romans do me right
patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not
till Saturninus be Rome's emperor
Andronicus would thou wert shipp'd to hell
rather than rob me of the people's hearts

proud Saturnine interrupter of the good
that noble-minded Titus means to thee

content thee prince I will restore to thee
the people's hearts and wean them from themselves

Andronicus I do not flatter thee
but honour thee and will do till I die
my faction if thou strengthen with thy friends
I will most thankful be and thanks to men
of noble minds is honourable meed

people of Rome and people's tribunes here
will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus

to gratify the good Andronicus
and gratulate his safe return to Rome
the people will accept whom he admits

tribunes I thank you and this suit I make
that you create your emperor's eldest son
lord Saturnine whose virtues will I hope
reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth
and ripen justice in this commonweal
then if you will elect by my advice
crown him and say Long live our emperor

with voices and applause of every sort
patricians and plebeians we create
lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor
and say Long live our Emperor Saturnine

Titus Andronicus for thy favours done
to us in our election this day
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts
and will with deeds requite thy gentleness
and for an onset Titus to advance
thy name and honourable family
Lavinia will I make my empress
Rome's royal mistress mistress of my heart
and in the sacred Pantheon her espouse
tell me Andronicus doth this motion please thee

it doth my worthy lord and in this match
I hold me highly honour'd of your Grace
and here in sight of Rome to Saturnine
king and commander of our commonweal
the wide world's emperor do I consecrate
my sword my chariot and my prisoners
presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord
receive them then the tribute that I owe

thanks noble Titus father of my life
how proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Rome shall record and when I do forget
the least of these unspeakable deserts
Romans forget your fealty to me

now madam are you prisoner to an emperor
to him that for your honour and your state
will use you nobly and your followers

a goodly lady trust me of the hue
that I would choose were I to choose anew
clear up fair queen that cloudy countenance
though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer
thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome
princely shall be thy usage every way
rest on my word and let not discontent
daunt all your hopes madam he comforts you
Lavinia you are not displeas'd with this

not I my lord sith true nobility
warrants these words in princely courtesy

thanks sweet Lavinia Romans let us go
ransomless here we set our prisoners free
proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum


lord Titus by your leave this maid is mine


how sir Are you in earnest then my lord

ay noble Titus and resolv'd withal
to do myself this reason and this right

suum cuique is our Roman justice

and that he will and shall if Lucius live

traitors avaunt Where is the emperor's guard
treason my lord Lavinia is surpris'd

surpris'd By whom

by him that justly may
bear his betroth'd from all the world away


brothers help to convey her hence away
and with my sword I'll keep this door safe


follow my lord and I'll soon bring her back

my lord you pass not here
what villain boy
barr'st me my way in Rome


help Lucius help

my lord you are unjust and more than so
in wrongful quarrel you have slain your son

nor thou nor he are any sons of mine
my sons would never so dishonour me
traitor restore Lavinia to the emperor

dead if you will but not to be his wife
that is another's lawful promis'd love


no Titus no the emperor needs her not
nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock
thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons
confederates all thus to dishonour me
was none in Rome to make a stale
but Saturnine Full well Andronicus
agreed these deeds with that proud brag of thine
that saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands

O monstrous what reproachful words are these

but go thy ways go give that changing piece
to him that flourish'd for her with his sword
a valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy
one fit to bandy with thy lawless sons
to ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome

these words are razors to my wounded heart

and therefore lovely Tamora Queen of Goths
that like the stately Ph be mongst her nymphs
if thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice
behold I choose thee Tamora for my bride
and will create thee Empress of Rome
speak Queen of Goths dost thou applaud my choice
and here I swear by all the Roman gods
sith priest and holy water are so near
and tapers burn so bright and every thing
in readiness for Hymen us stand
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome
or climb my palace till from forth this place
I lead espous'd my bride along with me

and here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear
if Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths
she will a handmaid be to his desires
a loving nurse a mother to his youth

ascend fair queen Pantheon Lords accompany
your noble emperor and his lovely bride
whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered
there shall we consummate our spousal rights


I am not bid to wait upon this bride
Titus when wert thou wont to walk alone
dishonour'd thus and challenged of wrongs


O Titus see O see what thou hast done
in a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son

no foolish tribune no no son of mine
nor thou nor these confederates in the deed
that hath dishonour'd all our family
unworthy brother and unworthy sons

but let us give him burial as becomes
give Mutius burial with our brethren
traitors away he rests not in this tomb
this monument five hundred years hath stood
which I have sumptuously re-edified
here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
repose in fame none basely slain in brawls
bury him where you can he comes not here

my lord this is impiety in you
my nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
he must be buried with his brethren

and shall or him we will accompany

and shall or him we will accompany

and shall What villain was it spake that word

he that would vouch it in any place but here


no noble Titus but entreat of thee
to pardon Mutius and to bury him

Marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest
and with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded
my foes I do repute you every one
so trouble me no more but get you gone

he is not with himself let us withdraw

not I till Mutius' bones be buried


brother for in that name doth nature plead

father and in that name doth nature speak

speak thou no more if all the rest will speed
renowned Titus more than half my soul

dear father soul and substance of us all

suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
his noble nephew here in virtue's nest
that died in honour and Lavinia's cause
thou art a Roman be not barbarous
the Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
that slew himself and wise Laertes' son
did graciously plead for his funerals
let not young Mutius then that was thy joy
be barr'd his entrance here

rise Marcus rise
the dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw
to be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome
well bury him and bury me the next

there lie thy bones sweet Mutius with thy friends
till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb

no man shed tears for noble Mutius
he lives in fame that died in virtue's cause

my lord to step out of these dreary dumps
how comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome

I know not Marcus but I know it is
whether by device or no the heavens can tell
is she not then beholding to the man
that brought her for this high good turn so far

yes and will nobly him remunerate

so Bassianus you have play'd your prize
God give you joy sir of your gallant bride
and you of yours my lord I say no more
nor wish no less and so I take my leave

traitor if Rome have law or we have power
thou and thy faction shall repent this rape

rape call you it my lord to seize my own
my true-betrothed love and now my wife
but let the laws of Rome determine all
meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine

'Tis good sir you are very short with us
but if we live we'll be as sharp with you

my lord what I have done as best I may
answer I must and shall do with my life
only thus much I give your Grace to know
by all the duties that I owe to Rome
this noble gentleman Lord Titus here
that in the rescue of Lavinia
with his own hand did slay his youngest son
in zeal to you and highly mov'd to wrath
to be controll'd in that he frankly gave
receive him then to favour Saturnine
that hath express'd himself in all his deeds
a father and a friend to thee and Rome

prince Bassianus leave to plead my deeds
'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
how I have lov'd and honour'd Saturnine

my worthy lord if ever Tamora
were gracious in those princely eyes of thine
then hear me speak indifferently for all
and at my suit sweet pardon what is past

what madam be dishonour'd openly

not so my lord the gods of Rome forfend
I should be author to dishonour you
but on mine honour dare I undertake
for good Lord Titus' innocence in all
whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs
then at my suit look graciously on him
lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose
nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart


my lord be rul'd by me be won at last
dissemble all your griefs and discontents
you are but newly planted in your throne
lest then the people and patricians too
upon a just survey take Titus' part
and so supplant you for ingratitude
which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin
yield at entreats and then let me alone
and raze their faction and their family
the cruel father and his traitorous sons
to whom I sued for my dear son's life
and make them know what tis to let a queen
kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain


come come sweet emperor come Andronicus
take up this good old man and cheer the heart
that dies in tempest of thy angry frown

rise Titus rise my empress hath prevail'd

I thank your majesty and her my lord
these words these looks infuse new life in me

Titus I am incorporate in Rome
a Roman now adopted happily
and must advise the emperor for his good
and let it be mine honour good my lord
that I have reconcil'd your friends and you
for you Prince Bassianus I have pass'd
my word and promise to the emperor
that you will be more mild and tractable
and fear not lords and you Lavinia
by my advice all humbled on your knees
you shall ask pardon of his majesty

we do and vow to heaven and to his highness
that what we did was mildly as we might
tendering our sister's honour and our own

that on mine honour here I do protest

away and talk not trouble us no more

nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends
the tribune and his nephews kneel for grace

Marcus for thy sake and thy brother's here
and at my lovely Tamora's entreats
I do remit these young men's heinous faults
stand up
Lavinia though you left me like a churl
I found a friend and sure as death I swore
I would not part a bachelor from the priest
come if the emperor's court can feast two brides
you are my guest Lavinia and your friends
this day shall be a love-day Tamora

to-morrow an it please your majesty
to hunt the panther and the hart with me
with horn and hound we'll give your Grace bon jour

be it so Titus and gramercy too


safe out of Fortune's shot and sits aloft
secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash
advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach
as when the golden sun salutes the morn
and having gilt the ocean with his beams
gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach
and overlooks the highest-peering hills
so Tamora
upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown
then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress
and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
hast prisoner held fetter'd in amorous chains
and faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus
away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold
to wait upon this new-made empress
this goddess this Semiramis this nymph
this siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine
and see his shipwrack and his commonweal's
holla what storm is this


Chiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edge
and manners to intrude where I am grac'd
and may for aught thou know'st affected be

Demetrius thou dost over-ween in all
and so in this to bear me down with braves
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate
I am as able and as fit as thou
to serve and to deserve my mistress' grace
and that my sword upon thee shall approve
and plead my passions for Lavinia's love


why boy although our mother unadvis'd
gave you a dancing-rapier by your side
are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
go to have your lath glu'd within your sheath
till you know better how to handle it

meanwhile sir with the little skill I have
full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare

ay boy grow ye so brave


why how now lords
so near the emperor's palace dare you draw
and maintain such a quarrel openly
full well I wot the ground of all this grudge
I would not for a million of gold
the cause were known to them it most concerns
be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome
for shame put up

not I till I have sheath'd
my rapier in his bosom and withal
thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
that he hath breath'd in my dishonour here

for that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd
foul-spoken coward that thunder'st with thy tongue
and with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform

away I say
now by the gods that war-like Goths adore
this petty brabble will undo us all
why lords and think you not how dangerous
it is to jet upon a prince's right
what is Lavinia then become so loose
or Bassianus so degenerate
without controlment justice or revenge
young lords beware an should the empress know
this discord's ground the music would not please

I care not I knew she and all the world
I love Lavinia more than all the world

youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope

why are ye mad or know ye not in Rome
how furious and impatient they be
and cannot brook competitors in love
I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
by this device

Aaron a thousand deaths
would I propose to achieve her whom I love


why mak'st thou it so strange
she is a woman therefore may be woo'd
she is a woman therefore may be won
she is Lavinia therefore must be lov'd
what man more water glideth by the mill
than wots the miller of and easy it is
of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
though Bassianus be the emperor's brother
better than he have worn Vulcan's badge

ay and as good as Saturninus may

then why should he despair that knows to court it
with words fair looks and liberality
what hast thou not full often struck a doe
and borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose

why then it seems some certain snatch or so

ay so the turn were serv'd

Aaron thou hast hit it

would you had hit it too
then should not we be tir'd with this ado
why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools
to square for this Would it offend you then
that both should speed

faith not me

nor me so I were one

for shame be friends and join for that you jar
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
that you affect and so must you resolve
that what you cannot as you would achieve
take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste
than this Lavinia Bassianus' love
a speedier course than lingering languishment
must we pursue and I have found the path
my lords a solemn hunting is in hand
there will the lovely Roman ladies troop
the forest walks are wide and spacious
and many unfrequented plots there are
fitted by kind for rape and villany
single you thither then this dainty doe
and strike her home by force if not by words
this way or not at all stand you in hope
come come our empress with her sacred wit
to villany and vengeance consecrate
will we acquaint with all that we intend
and she shall file our engines with advice
that will not suffer you to square yourselves
but to your wishes' height advance you both
the emperor's court is like the house of Fame
the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns
there serve your lusts shadow'd from heaven's eye
and revel in Lavinia's treasury

thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice

sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream
to cool this heat a charm to calm these fits
per Styga per manes vehor

the hunt is up the morn is bright and grey
the fields are fragrant and the woods are green
uncouple here and let us make a bay
and wake the emperor and his lovely bride
and rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal
that all the court may echo with the noise
sons let it be your charge as it is ours
to attend the emperor's person carefully
but dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd

many good morrows to your majesty
madam to you as many and as good

I promised your Grace a hunter's peal

and you have rung it lustily my lord
somewhat too early for new-married ladies

Lavinia how say you

I say no
I have been broad awake two hours and more

come on then horse and chariots let us have
and to our sport

madam now shall ye see

I have dogs my lord
will rouse the proudest panther in the chase
and climb the highest promontory top

and I have horse will follow where the game
makes way and run like swallows o'er the plain

Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound
but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground


he that had wit would think that I had none
to bury so much gold under a tree
and never after to inherit it
let him that thinks of me so abjectly
know that this gold must coin a stratagem
which cunningly effected will beget
a very excellent piece of villany
that have their alms out of the empress' chest

my lovely Aaron wherefore look'st thou sad
when every thing doth make a gleeful boast
the birds chant melody on every bush
the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun
the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
and make a chequer'd shadow on the ground
under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit
and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds
replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns
as if a double hunt were heard at once
let us sit down and mark their yelping noise
and after conflict such as was suppos'd
the wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd
when with a happy storm they were surpris'd
and curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave
we may each wreathed in the other's arms
our pastimes done possess a golden slumber
be unto us as is a nurse's song
of lullaby to bring her babe asleep

madam though Venus govern your desires
Saturn is dominator over mine
what signifies my deadly-standing eye
my silence and my cloudy melancholy
my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
even as an adder when she doth unroll
to do some fatal execution
no madam these are no venereal signs
vengeance is in my heart death in my hand
blood and revenge are hammering in my head
hark Tamora the empress of my soul
which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee
this is the day of doom for Bassianus
his Philomel must lose her tongue to-day
thy sons make pillage of her chastity
and wash their hands in Bassianus' blood
and give the king this fatal-plotted scroll
now question me no more we are espied
here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
which dreads not yet their lives' destruction

Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life

no more great empress Bassianus comes
be cross with him and I'll go fetch thy sons
to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be

who have we here Rome's royal empress
unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop
or is it Dian habited like her
who hath abandoned her holy groves
to see the general hunting in this forest

saucy controller of our private steps
had I the power that some say Dian had
with horns as was Act on's and the hounds
should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs
unmannerly intruder as thou art

under your patience gentle empress
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning
and to be doubted that your Moor and you
are singled forth to try experiments
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag

believe me queen your swarth Cimmerian
doth make your honour of his body's hue
spotted detested and abominable
why are you sequester'd from all your train
dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed
and wander'd hither to an obscure plot
accompanied but with a barbarous Moor
if foul desire had not conducted you
and being intercepted in your sport
great reason that my noble lord be rated
for sauciness I pray you let us hence
and let her joy her raven-colour'd love
this valley fits the purpose passing well

the king my brother shall have note of this

ay for these slips have made him noted long
good king to be so mightily abus'd

why have I patience to endure all this


how now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
why doth your highness look so pale and wan

have I not reason think you to look pale
these two have tic'd me hither to this place
the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
o'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe
here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
unless the nightly owl or fatal raven
and when they show'd me this abhorred pit
they told me here at dead time of the night
a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
would make such fearful and confused cries
as any mortal body hearing it
should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
no sooner had they told this hellish tale
but straight they told me they would bind me here
unto the body of a dismal yew
and leave me to this miserable death
and then they called me foul adulteress
lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms
that ever ear did hear to such effect
and had you not by wondrous fortune come
revenge it as you love your mother's life
or be ye not henceforth call'd my children

this is a witness that I am thy son


and this for me struck home to show my strength


ay come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora
for no name fits thy nature but thy own

give me thy poniard you shall know my boys
your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong

stay madam here is more belongs to her
first thrash the corn than after burn the straw
this minion stood upon her chastity
upon her nuptial vow her loyalty
and shall she carry this unto her grave

an if she do I would I were an eunuch
drag hence her husband to some secret hole
and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust

but when ye have the honey ye desire
let not this wasp outlive us both to sting

I warrant you madam we will make that sure
come mistress now perforce we will enjoy
that nice-preserved honesty of yours

O Tamora thou bear'st a woman's face

I will not hear her speak away with her

sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word

to see her tears but be your heart to them
as unrelenting flint to drops of rain

when did the tiger's young ones teach the dam
O do not learn her wrath she taught it thee
the milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble
even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
yet every mother breeds not sons alike


do thou entreat her show a woman pity

what wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard

'Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark
yet have I heard O could I find it now
the lion mov'd with pity did endure
to have his princely paws par'd all away
some say that ravens foster forlorn children
O be to me though thy hard heart say no
nothing so kind but something pitiful

I know not what it means away with her

O let me teach thee for my father's sake
that gave thee life when well he might have slain thee
be not obdurate open thy deaf ears

hadst thou in person ne'er offended me
even for his sake am I pitiless
remember boys I pour'd forth tears in vain
to save your brother from the sacrifice
but fierce Andronicus would not relent
therefore away with her and use her as you will
the worse to her the better lov'd of me

O Tamora be call'd a gentle queen
and with thine own hands kill me in this place
poor I was slain when Bassianus died

what begg'st thou then fond woman let me go

'Tis present death I beg and one thing more
that womanhood denies my tongue to tell
O keep me from their worse than killing lust
and tumble me into some loathsome pit
where never man's eye may behold my body
do this and be a charitable murderer

so should I rob my sweet sons of their fee
no let them satisfy their lust on thee

away for thou hast stay'd us here too long

no grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature
the blot and enemy to our general name
confusion fall
nay then I'll stop your mouth Bring thou her husband
this is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him

farewell my sons see that you make her sure
ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
till all the Andronici be made away
now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor
and let my spleenful sons this trull deflower

come on my lords the better foot before
straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
where I espied the panther fast asleep

my sight is very dull whate'er it bodes

and mine I promise you were't not for shame
well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile


whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers
upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
as fresh as morning's dew distill'd on flowers
a very fatal place it seems to me
speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall

O brother with the dismall'st object hurt
that ever eye with sight made heart lament

now will I fetch the king to find them here
that he thereby may give a likely guess
how these were they that made away his brother


why dost not comfort me and help me out
from this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole

I am surprised with an uncouth fear
a chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints

to prove thou hast a true-divining heart
Aaron and thou look down into this den
and see a fearful sight of blood and death

Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart
will not permit mine eyes once to behold
the thing whereat it trembles by surmise
O tell me how it is for ne'er till now
was I a child to fear I know not what

lord Bassianus lies embrewed here
all on a heap like to a slaughter'd lamb
in this detested dark blood-drinking pit

if it be dark how dost thou know tis he

upon his bloody finger he doth wear
a precious ring that lightens all the hole
doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks
and shows the ragged entrails of the pit
so pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
when he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood
O brother help me with thy fainting hand
if fear hath made thee faint as me it hath
out of this fell devouring receptacle
as hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth

reach me thy hand that I may help thee out
or wanting strength to do thee so much good
I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
of this deep pit poor Bassianus' grave
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink

nor I no strength to climb without thy help

thy hand once more I will not loose again
till thou art here aloft or I below

along with me I'll see what hole is here
and what he is that now is leap'd into it
say who art thou that lately didst descend
into this gaping hollow of the earth

the unhappy son of old Andronicus
brought hither in a most unlucky hour
to find thy brother Bassianus dead

my brother dead I know thou dost but jest
he and his lady both are at the lodge
upon the north side of this pleasant chase
'Tis not an hour since I left him there

we know not where you left him all alive
but out alas here have we found him dead



here Tamora though griev'd with killing grief

where is thy brother Bassianus

now to the bottom dost thou search my wound
poor Bassianus here lies murdered

then all too late I bring this fatal writ

the complot of this timeless tragedy
and wonder greatly that man's face can fold
in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny

and if we miss to meet him handsomely
sweet huntsman Bassianus tis we mean
do thou so much as dig the grave for him
thou know'st our meaning Look for thy reward
among the nettles at the elder-tree
where we decreed to bury Bassianus
do this and purchase us thy lasting friends
O Tamora was ever heard the like
this is the pit and this the elder-tree
look sirs if you can find the huntsman out
that should have murder'd Bassianus here

my gracious lord here is the bag of gold

two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind
have here bereft my brother of his life
sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
there let them bide until we have devis'd
some never-heard-of torturing pain for them

what are they in this pit O wondrous thing
how easily murder is discovered

high emperor upon my feeble knee
that this fell fault of my accursed sons
accursed if the fault be prov'd in them

if it be prov'd you see it is apparent
who found this letter Tamora was it you

Andronicus himself did take it up

I did my lord yet let me be their bail
for by my father's reverend tomb I vow
they shall be ready at your highness' will
to answer their suspicion with their lives

thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me
some bring the murder'd body some the murderers
let them not speak a word the guilt is plain
for by my soul were there worse end than death
that end upon them should be executed

fear not thy sons they shall do well enough

come Lucius come stay not to talk with them


so now go tell an if thy tongue can speak
who twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee

write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so
an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe

see how with signs and tokens she can scrowl

go home call for sweet water wash thy hands

she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
and so let's leave her to her silent walks

an twere my case I should go hang myself
if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord

who's this my niece that flies away so fast
cousin a word where is your husband
if I do dream would all my wealth would wake me
if I do wake some planet strike me down
that I may slumber in eternal sleep
speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands
have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
of her two branches those sweet ornaments
whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
and might not gain so great a happiness
as have thy love Why dost not speak to me
alas a crimson river of warm blood
like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind
doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips
coming and going with thy honey breath
but sure some Tereus hath deflower'd thee
and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
and notwithstanding all this loss of blood
as from a conduit with three issuing spouts
yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
blushing to be encounter'd with a cloud
shall I speak for thee shall I say tis so
O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast
that I might rail at him to ease my mind
sorrow concealed like to an oven stopp'd
doth burn the heart to cinders where it is
fair Philomela she but lost her tongue
and in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind
but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
a craftier Tereus hast thou met withal
and he hath cut those pretty fingers off
that could have better sew'd than Philomel
O had the monster seen those lily hands
tremble like aspen-leaves upon a lute
and make the silken strings delight to kiss them
he would not then have touch'd them for his life
which that sweet tongue hath made
he would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep
as Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet
come let us go and make thy father blind
for such a sight will blind a father's eye
one hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads
what will whole months of tears thy father's eyes
do not draw back for we will mourn with thee
O could our mourning ease thy misery

hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
for pity of mine age whose youth was spent
in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
for all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed
for all the frosty nights that I have watch'd
and for these bitter tears which now you see
filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks
be pitiful to my condemned sons
whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought
because they died in honour's lofty bed
for these these tribunes in the dust I write

my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears
let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite
my sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush

O earth I will befriend thee more with rain
that shall distil from these two ancient urns
than youthful April shall with all his showers
in summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still
in winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
and keep eternal spring-time on thy face
so thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood


O reverend tribunes O gentle aged men
unbind my sons reverse the doom of death
and let me say that never wept before
my tears are now prevailing orators

O noble father you lament in vain
the tribunes hear you not no man is by
and you recount your sorrows to a stone

Ah Lucius for thy brothers let me plead
grave tribunes once more I entreat of you

my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak

why tis no matter man if they did hear
they would not mark me or if they did mark
they would not pity me yet plead I must
all bootless unto them
therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones
who though they cannot answer my distress
yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes
for that they will not intercept my tale
receive my tears and seem to weep with me
and were they but attired in grave weeds
Rome could afford no tribune like to these
a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones
a stone is silent and offendeth not
and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death

but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn

to rescue my two brothers from their death
for which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
my everlasting doom of banishment

O happy man they have befriended thee
why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive
that Rome is but a wilderness of tigers
tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey
but me and mine how happy art thou then
from these devourers to be banished


Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep
or if not so thy noble heart to break
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age

will it consume me let me see it then

this was thy daughter

why Marcus so she is

ay me this object kills me

faint-hearted boy arise and look upon her
speak Lavinia what accursed hand
hath made thee handless in thy father's sight
what fool hath added water to the sea
or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy
and now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds
give me a sword I'll chop off my hands too
for they have fought for Rome and all in vain
and they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life
in bootless prayer have they been held up
and they have serv'd me to effectless use
now all the service I require of them
is that the one will help to cut the other
'Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands
for hands to do Rome service are but vain

speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee

O that delightful engine of her thoughts
that blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
sweet varied notes enchanting every ear


O thus I found her straying in the park
seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
that hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound

it was my dear and he that wounded her
hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead
for now I stand as one upon a rock
environ'd with a wilderness of sea
who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
expecting ever when some envious surge
will in his brinish bowels swallow him
this way to death my wretched sons are gone
here stands my other son a banish'd man
and here my brother weeping at my woes
but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul
had I but seen thy picture in this plight
it would have madded me what shall I do
thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee
thy husband he is dead and for his death
thy brothers are condemn'd and dead by this
look Marcus ah son Lucius look on her
when I did name her brothers then fresh tears
stood on her cheeks as doth the honey-dew
upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd

perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband
perchance because she knows them innocent

if they did kill thy husband then be joyful
because the law hath ta'en revenge on them
no no they would not do so foul a deed
witness the sorrow that their sister makes
gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips
or make some sign how I may do thee ease
shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
how they are stain'd like meadows yet not dry
with miry alime left on them by a flood
and in the fountain shall we gaze so long
till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
and made a brine-pit with our bitter tears
or shall we cut away our hands like thine
or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
pass the remainder of our hateful days
what shall we do let us that have our tongues
plot some device of further misery
to make us wonder'd at in time to come

sweet father cease your tears for at your grief
see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps

patience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyes

Ah Marcus Marcus brother well I wot
for thou poor man hast drown'd it with thine own

Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks

mark Marcus mark I understand her signs
had she a tongue to speak now would she say
that to her brother which I said to thee
his napkin with his true tears all bewet
can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
O what a sympathy of woe is this
as far from help as limbo is from bliss


Titus Andronicus my lord the emperor
sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons
let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus
or any one of you chop off your hand
and send it to the king he for the same
will send thee hither both thy sons alive

O gracious emperor O gentle Aaron
did ever raven sing so like a lark
that gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise
with all my heart I'll send the emperor my hand
good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off

stay father for that noble hand of thine
that hath thrown down so many enemies
shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn
my youth can better spare my blood than you
and therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives

which of your hands hath not defended Rome
and rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe
writing destruction on the enemy's castle
O none of both but are of high desert
my hand hath been but idle let it serve
to ransom my two nephews from their death

nay come agree whose hand shall go along
for fear they die before their pardon come

my hand shall go

by heaven it shall not go

sirs strive no more such wither'd herbs as these
are meet for plucking up and therefore mine

sweet father if I shall be thought thy son
let me redeem my brothers both from death

and for our father's sake and mother's care
now let me show a brother's love to thee

agree between you I will spare my hand


but I will use the axe


come hither Aaron I'll deceive them both
lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine

if that be call'd deceit I will be honest
and never whilst I live deceive men so
but I'll deceive you in another sort
and that you'll say ere half an hour pass

now stay your strife what shall be is dispatch'd
good Aaron give his majesty my hand
tell him it was a hand that warded him
from thousand dangers bid him bury it
more hath it merited that let it have
as for my sons say I account of them
as jewels purchas'd at an easy price

I go Andronicus and for thy hand
look by and by to have thy sons with thee


their heads I mean O how this villany
doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
let fools do good and fair men call for grace
Aaron will have his soul black like his face


O here I lift this one hand up to heaven
and how this feeble ruin to the earth
if any power pities wretched tears
to that I call

what wilt thou kneel with me
do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers
or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
when they do hug him in their melting bosoms

O brother speak with possibilities
and do not break into these deep extremes

is not my sorrow deep having no bottom
then be my passions bottomless with them

but yet let reason govern thy lament

if there were reason for these miseries
then into limits could I bind my woes
when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow
if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad
threat'ning the welkin with his big-swoln face
and wilt thou have a reason for this coil
I am the sea hark how her sighs do blow
she is the weeping welkin I the earth
then must my sea be moved with her sighs
become a deluge overflow'd and drown'd
for why my bowels cannot hide her woes
but like a drunkard must I vomit them
then give me leave for losers will have leave
to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues


worthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid
for that good hand thou sent'st the emperor
here are the heads of thy two noble sons
and here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back
thy griefs their sports thy resolution mock'd
that woe is me to think upon thy woes
more than remembrance of my father's death


now let hot tna cool in Sicily
and be my heart an ever burning hell
these miseries are more than may be borne
but sorrow flouted at is double death

Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound
and yet detested life not shrink thereat
that ever death should let life bear his name
where life hath no more interest but to breathe


alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless
as frozen water to a starved snake

when will this fearful slumber have an end

now farewell flattery die Andronicus
thou dost not slumber see thy two sons' heads
thy war-like hand thy mangled daughter here
thy other banish'd son with this dear sight
struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I
even like a stony image cold and numb
rent off thy silver hair thy other hand
gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight
the closing up of our most wretched eyes
now is a time to storm why art thou still

ha ha ha

why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour

why I have not another tear to shed
besides this sorrow is an enemy
and would usurp upon my watery eyes
and make them blind with tributary tears
then which way shall I find Revenge's cave
for these two heads do seem to speak to me
and threat me I shall never come to bliss
till all these mischiefs be return'd again
even in their throats that have committed them
come let me see what task I have to do
that I may turn me to each one of you
and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs
the vow is made Come brother take a head
and in this hand the other will I bear
Lavinia thou shalt be employ'd in these things
bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth
as for thee boy go get thee from my sight
thou art an exile and thou must not stay
hie to the Goths and raise an army there
and if you love me as I think you do
let's kiss and part for we have much to do


farewell Andronicus my noble father
the woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome
farewell proud Rome till Lucius come again
he leaves his pledges dearer than his life
farewell Lavinia my noble sister
O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
but in oblivion and hateful griefs
if Lucius live he will requite your wrongs
and make proud Saturnine and his empress
beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen
now will I to the Goths and raise a power
to be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine


so so now sit and look you eat no more
than will preserve just so much strength in us
as will revenge these bitter woes of ours
Marcus unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot
thy niece and I poor creatures want our hands
and cannot passionate our ten-fold grief
with folded arms This poor right hand of mine
is left to tyrannize upon my breast
and when my heart all mad with misery
beats in this hollow prison of my flesh
then thus I thump it down

thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs
when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
thou canst not strike it thus to make it still
wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans
or get some little knife between thy teeth
and just against thy heart make thou a hole
that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
may run into that sink and soaking in
drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears

fie brother fie teach her not thus to lay
such violent hands upon her tender life

how now has sorrow made thee dote already
why Marcus no man should be mad but I
what violent hands can she lay on her life
Ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands
to bid aeas tell the tale twice o'er
O handle not the theme to talk of hands
lest we remember still that we have none
fie fie how franticly I square my talk
as if we should forget we had no hands
if Marcus did not name the word of hands
come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this
here is no drink Hark Marcus what she says
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs
she says she drinks no other drink but tears
brew'd with her sorrow mash'd upon her cheeks
speechless complainer I will learn thy thought
in thy dumb action will I be as perfect
as begging hermits in their holy prayers
thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven
nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign
but I of these will wrest an alphabet
and by still practice learn to know thy meaning

good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments

alas the tender boy in passion mov'd
doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness

peace tender sapling thou art made of tears
and tears will quickly melt thy life away

what dost thou strike at Marcus with thy knife

at that that I have kill'd my lord a fly

out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart
mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny
a deed of death done on the innocent
becomes not Titus' brother Get thee gone
I see thou art not for my company

alas my lord I have but kill'd a fly

how would he hang his slender gilded wings
and buzz lamenting doings in the air
poor harmless fly
that with his pretty buzzing melody
came here to make us merry and thou hast kill'd him

pardon me sir it was a black ill-favour'd fly
like to the empress' Moor therefore I kill'd him

O O O 
then pardon me for reprehending thee
for thou hast done a charitable deed
give me thy knife I will insult on him
flattering myself as if it were the Moor
come hither purposely to poison me
there's for thyself and that's for Tamora
Ah sirrah
yet I think we are not brought so low
but that between us we can kill a fly

alas poor man grief has so wrought on him
he takes false shadows for true substances

come take away Lavinia go with me
I'll to thy closet and go read with thee
sad stories chanced in the times of old
come boy and go with me thy sight is young
and thou shalt read when mine begins to dazzle

help grandsire help my aunt Lavinia
follows me everywhere I know not why
good uncle Marcus see how swift she comes
alas sweet aunt I know not what you mean

stand by me Lucius do not fear thine aunt

she loves thee boy too well to do thee harm


what means my niece Lavinia by these signs

fear her not Lucius somewhat doth she mean
see Lucius see how much she makes of thee
somewhither would she have thee go with her
Ah boy Cornelia never with more care
read to her sons than she hath read to thee
sweet poetry and Tully's Orator

canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus

my lord I know not I nor can I guess
unless some fit or frenzy do possess her
for I have heard my grandsire say full oft
extremity of griefs would make men mad
and I have read that Hecuba of Troy
ran mad through sorrow that made me to fear
although my lord I know my noble aunt
and would not but in fury fright my youth
which made me down to throw my books and fly
causeless perhaps But pardon me sweet aunt
and madam if my uncle Marcus go
I will most willingly attend your ladyship

Lucius I will


how now Lavinia Marcus what means this
some book there is that she desires to see
which is it girl of these Open them boy
but thou art deeper read and better skill'd
come and take choice of all my library
and so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens
reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed
why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus

I think she means that there was more than one
or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge

Lucius what book is that she tosseth so

grandsire tis Ovid's Metamorphoses
my mother gave it me

for love of her that's gone
perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest

soft see how busily she turns the leaves

what would she find Lavinia shall I read
this is the tragic tale of Philomel
and treats of Tereus' treason and his rape
and rape I fear was root of thine annoy

see brother see note how she quotes the leaves

ravish'd and wrong'd as Philomela was
forc'd in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods
see see
ay such a place there is where we did hunt
O had we never never hunted there
pattern'd by that the poet here describes
by nature made for murders and for rapes

O why should nature build so foul a den
unless the gods delight in tragedies

give signs sweet girl for here are none but friends
what Roman lord it was durst do the deed
or slunk not Saturnine as Tarquin erst
that left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed

sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me
Apollo Pallas Jove or Mercury
inspire me that I may this treason find
this sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst
this after me

I have writ my name
without the help of any hand at all
curs'd be that heart that forc'd us to this shift
write thou good niece and here display at last
what God will have discover'd for revenge
heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain
that we may know the traitors and the truth


O do you read my lord what she hath writ
stuprum Chiron Demetrius

what what the lustful sons of Tamora
performers of this heinous bloody deed

magni dominator poli

O calm thee gentle lord although I know
there is enough written upon this earth
to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
and arm the minds of infants to exclaims
my lord kneel down with me Lavinia kneel
and kneel sweet boy the Roman Hector's hope
and swear with me as with the woeful fere
and father of that chaste dishonour'd dame
lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape
that we will prosecute by good advice
mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths
and see their blood or die with this reproach

'Tis sure enough an you knew how
but if you hunt these bear-whelps then beware
the dam will wake an if she wind you once
she's with the lion deeply still in league
and lulls him whilst she playeth on her back
you're a young huntsman Marcus let it alone
and come I will go get a leaf of brass
and with a gad of steel will write these words
and lay it by the angry northern wind
will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad
and where's your lesson then Boy what say you

I say my lord that if I were a man
their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
for these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome

ay that's my boy thy father hath full oft
for his ungrateful country done the like

and uncle so will I an if I live

come go with me into mine armoury
Lucius I'll fit thee and withal my boy
shall carry from me to the empress' sons
come come thou'lt do thy message wilt thou not

ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire

no boy not so I'll teach thee another course
Lavinia come Marcus look to my house
Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court
ay marry will we sir and we'll be waited on


O heavens can you hear a good man groan
and not relent or not compassion him
Marcus attend him in his ecstasy
that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield
but yet so just that he will not revenge
revenge ye heavens for old Andronicus


he hath some message to deliver us

ay some mad message from his mad grandfather

my lords with all the humbleness I may
I greet your honours from Andronicus


and pray the Roman gods confound you both

gramercy lovely Lucius what's the news

that you are both decipher'd that's the news
for villains mark'd with rape

may it please you
my grandsire well advis'd hath sent by me
the goodliest weapons of his armoury
to gratify your honourable youth
and so I do and with his gifts present
your lordships that whenever you have need
you may be armed and appointed well
and so I leave you both

like bloody villains


what's here A scroll and written round about
let's see

'Integer vit scelerisque purus
non eget Mauri jaculis nec arcu


O tis a verse in Horace I know it well
I read it in the grammar long ago

ay just a verse in Horace right you have it

now what a thing it is to be an ass
here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt
and sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines
that wound beyond their feeling to the quick
but were our witty empress well afoot
she would applaud Andronicus' conceit
but let her rest in her unrest awhile


and now young lords was't not a happy star
led us to Rome strangers and more than so
captives to be advanced to this height
it did me good before the palace gate
to brave the tribune in his brother's hearing

but me more good to see so great a lord
basely insinuate and send us gifts

did you not use his daughter very friendly

I would we had a thousand Roman dames
at such a bay by turn to serve our lust

a charitable wish and full of love

here lacks but your mother for to say amen

and that would she for twenty thousand more

come let us go and pray to all the gods
for our beloved mother in her pains

pray to the devils the gods have given us over


why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus


soft who comes here


good morrow lords O tell me did you see
Aaron the Moor

well more or less or ne'er a whit at all
here Aaron is and what with Aaron now

O gentle Aaron we are all undone
now help or woe betide thee evermore

why what a caterwauling dost thou keep
what dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms

O that which I would hide from heaven's eye
our empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace
she is deliver'd lords she is deliver'd
to whom

I mean she's brought a-bed

well God give her good rest What hath he sent her

a devil

why then she's the devil's dam a joyful issue

a joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue
here is the babe as loathsome as a toad
amongst the fairest breeders of our clime
the empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal
and bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point

'Zounds ye whore is black so base a hue
sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure


that which thou canst not undo

thou hast undone our mother

villain I have done thy mother

and therein hellish dog thou hast undone
woe to her chance and damn'd her loathed choice
accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend

it shall not live

it shall not die

Aaron it must the mother wills it so

what must it nurse then let no man but I
do execution on my flesh and blood
I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point
nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it

sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up

stay murderous villains will you kill your brother
now by the burning tapers of the sky
that shone so brightly when this boy was got
he dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
that touches this my first-born son and heir
I tell you younglings not Enceladus
with all his threatening band of Typhon's brood
nor great Alcides nor the god of war
shall seize this prey out of his father's hands
what what ye sanguine shallow-hearted boys
ye white-lim'd walls ye alehouse painted signs
coal-black is better than another hue
in that it scorns to bear another hue
for all the water in the ocean
although she lave them hourly in the flood
tell the empress from me I am of age
to keep mine own excuse it how she can

wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus

my mistress is my mistress this myself
the vigour and the picture of my youth
this before all the world do I prefer
this maugre all the world will I keep safe
or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome

by this our mother is for ever sham'd

Rome will despise her for this foul escape

the emperor in his rage will doom her death

I blush to think upon this ignomy
why there's the privilege your beauty bears
fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing
the close enacts and counsels of the heart
here's a young lad fram'd of another leer
look how the black slavesmiles upon the father
as who should say Old lad I am thine own
he is your brother lords sensibly fed
of that self blood that first gave life to you
and from that womb where you imprison'd were
he is enfranchised and come to light
nay he is your brother by the surer side
although my seal be stamped in his face

Aaron what shall I say unto the empress

advise thee Aaron what is to be done
and we will all subscribe to thy advice
save thou the child so we may all be safe

my son and I will have the wind of you
keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety


how many women saw this child of his

why so brave lords when we join in league
I am a lamb but if you brave the Moor
the chafed boar the mountain lioness
the ocean swells not so as Aaron storms
but say again how many saw the child

Cornelia the midwife and myself
and no one else but the deliver'd empress

the empress the midwife and yourself
two may keep counsel when the third's away
go to the empress tell her this I said

so cries a pig prepared to the spit

what mean'st thou Aaron Wherefore didst thou this

O lord sir tis a deed of policy
shall she live to betray this guilt of ours
a long-tongu'd babbling gossip no lords no
and now be it known to you my full intent
not far one Muli lives my countryman
his wife but yesternight was brought to bed
his child is like to her fair as you are
go pack with him and give the mother gold
and tell them both the circumstance of all
and how by this their child shall be advanc'd
and be received for the emperor's heir
and substituted in the place of mine
to calm this tempest whirling in the court
and let the emperor dandle him for his own
hark ye lords you see I have given her physic
and you must needs bestow her funeral
the fields are near and you are gallant grooms
this done see that you take no longer days
but send the midwife presently to me
the midwife and the nurse well made away
then let the ladies tattle what they please

Aaron I see thou wilt not trust the air
with secrets

for this care of Tamora
herself and hers are highly hound to thee


now to the Goths as swift as swallow flies
there to dispose this treasure in mine arms
and secretly to greet the empress' friends
come on you thick-lipp'd slave I'll bear you hence
for it is you that puts us to our shifts
and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat
and cabin in a cave and bring you up
to be a warrior and command a camp


come Marcus come kinsmen this is the way
sir boy now let me see your archery
look ye draw home enough and tis there straight
terras Astr a reliquit
be you remember'd Marcus she's gone she's fled
sirs take you to your tools You cousins shall
go sound the ocean and cast your nets
happily you may find her in the sea
yet there's as little justice as at land
no Publius and Sempronius you must do it
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade
and pierce the inmost centre of the earth
then when you come to Pluto's region
I pray you deliver him this petition
and that it comes from old Andronicus
shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome
Ah Rome Well well I made thee miserable
what time I threw the people's suffrages
on him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me
go get you gone and pray be careful all
and leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd
this wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence
and kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice

O Publius is not this a heavy case
to see thy noble uncle thus distract

therefore my lord it highly us concerns
by day and night to attend him carefully
and feed his humour kindly as we may
till time beget some careful remedy

kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude
and vengeance on the traitor Saturnine

Publius how now how now my masters
what have you met with her

no my good lord but Pluto sends you word
if you will have Revenge from hell you shall
marry for Justice she is so employ'd
he thinks with Jove in heaven or somewhere else
so that perforce you must needs stay a time

he doth me wrong to feed me with delays
I'll dive into the burning lake below
and pull her out of Acheron by the heels
Marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we
no big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size
but metal Marcus steel to the very back
yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear
we will solicit heaven and move the gods
to send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs
come to this gear You are a good archer Marcus

ad Javem that's for you here ad Apollinem
ad Martem that's for myself
here boy to Pallas here to Mercury
to Saturn Caius not to Saturnine
you were as good to shoot against the wind
to it boy Marcus loose when I bid
of my word I have written to effect
there's not a god left unsolicited

kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court
we will afflict the emperor in his pride

now masters draw

O well said Lucius

my lord I aim a mile beyond the moon
your letter is with Jupiter by this

ha Publius Publius what hast thou done
see see thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns

this was the sport my lord when Publius shot
the Bull being gall'd gave Aries such a knock
that down fell both the Ram's horns in the court
and who should find them but the empress' villain
she laugh'd and told the Moor he should not choose
but give them to his master for a present

why there it goes God give his lordship joy


news news from heaven Marcus the post is come
sirrah what tidings have you any letters
shall I have justice what says Jupiter

O tho gibbet-maker He says that he hath taken them down again for the man must not be hanged till the next week

but what says Jupiter I ask thee

alas sir I know not Jupiter I never drank with him in all my life

why villain art not thou the carrier

ay of my pigeons sir nothing else

why didst thou not come from heaven

from heaven alas sir I never came there God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days Why I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men

why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you

tell me can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace
nay truly sir I could never say grace in all my life

sirrah come hither make no more ado
but give your pigeons to the emperor
by me thou shalt have justice at his hands
hold hold meanwhile here's money for thy charges
give me pen and ink
sirrah can you with a grace deliver a supplication

ay sir

then here is a supplication for you And when you come to him at the first approach you must kneel then kiss his foot then deliver up your pigeons and then look for your reward I'll be at hand sir see you do it bravely

I warrant you sir let me alone

sirrah hast thou a knife Come let me see it
here Marcus fold it in the oration
for thou hast made it like a humble suppliant
and when thou hast given it to the emperor

God be with you sir I will

come Marcus let us go Publius follow me

why lords what wrongs are these Was ever seen
an emperor of Rome thus overborne
troubled confronted thus and for the extent
of egal justice us'd in such contempt
my lords you know as do the mightful gods
however these disturbers of our peace
buzz in the people's ears there nought hath pass'd
but even with law against the wilful sons
of old Andronicus And what an if
his sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits
shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
his fits his frenzy and his bitterness
and now he writes to heaven for his redress
see here's to Jove and this to Mercury
sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome
what's this but libelling against the senate
and blazoning our injustice every where
a goodly humour is it not my lords
as who would say in Rome no justice were
but if I live his feigned ecstasies
shall be no shelter to these outrages
but he and his shall know that justice lives
in Saturninus' health whom if she sleep
he'll so awake as she in fury shall
cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives

my gracious lord my lovely Saturnine
lord of my life commander of my thoughts
calm thee and bear the faults of Titus' age
the effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart
and rather comfort his distressed plight
than prosecute the meanest or the best

why thus it shall become
high-witted Tamora to gloze with all
but Titus I have touch'd thee to the quick
thy life-blood out if Aaron now be wise
then is all safe the anchor's in the port

how now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us

yea forsooth an your mistership be emperial

empress I am but yonder sits the emperor

'Tis he God and Saint Stephen give you good den
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here


go take him away and hang him presently


come sirrah you must be hanged

hanged By r lady then I have brought up a neck to a fair end


despiteful and intolerable wrongs
shall I endure this monstrous villany
I know from whence this same device proceeds
may this be borne As if his traitorous sons
that died by law for murder of our brother
have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully
go drag the villain hither by the hair
nor age nor honour shall shape privilege
for this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman
sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great
in hope thyself should govern Rome and me

what news with thee milius
arm arm my lord Rome never had more cause
the Goths have gather'd head and with a power
of high-resolved men bent to the spoil
they hither march amain under conduct
of Lucius son to old Andronicus
who threats in course of this revenge to do
as much as ever Coriolanus did

is war-like Lucius general of the Goths
these tidings nip me and I hang the head
as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
ay now begin our sorrows to approach
'Tis he the common people love so much
myself hath often heard them say
when I have walked like a private man
that Lucius' banishment was wrongfully
and they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor

why should you fear is not your city strong
ay but the citizens favour Lucius
and will revolt from me to succour him

king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it
the eagle suffers little birds to sing
and is not careful what they mean thereby
knowing that with the shadow of his wings
he can at pleasure stint their melody
even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome
then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor
I will enchant the old Andronicus
with words more sweet and yet more dangerous
than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep
whenas the one is wounded with the bait
the other rotted with delicious feed

but he will not entreat his son for us

for I can smooth and fill his aged ear
with golden promises that were his heart
almost impregnable his old ears deaf
yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue


go thou before be our ambassador
say that the emperor requests a parley
of war-like Lucius and appoint the meeting
even at his father's house the old Andronicus

milius do this message honourably
and if he stand on hostage for his safety
bid him demand what pledge will please him best

your bidding shall I do effectually


now will I to that old Andronicus
to pluck proud Lucius from the war-like Goths
and now sweet emperor be blithe again
and bury all thy fear in my devices

then go successantly and plead to him

approved warriors and my faithful friends
I have received letters from great Rome
which signify what hate they bear their emperor
and how desirous of our sight they are
therefore great lords be as your titles witness
imperious and impatient of your wrongs
and wherein Rome hath done you any scath
let him make treble satisfaction

brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus
whose name was once our terror now our comfort
whose high exploits and honourable deeds
ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt
like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
led by their master to the flower'd fields
and be aveng'd on cursed Tamora

and as he saith so say we all with him

I humbly thank him and I thank you all
but who comes here led by a lusty Goth


renowned Lucius from our troops I stray'd
to gaze upon a ruinous monastery
and as I earnestly did fix mine eye
upon the wasted building suddenly
I heard a child cry underneath a wall
I made unto the noise when soon I heard
the crying babe controll'd with this discourse
'Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam
did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
villain thou mightst have been an emperor
but where the bull and cow are both milk-white
they never do beget a coal-black calf
peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe
'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth
who when he knows thou art the empress' babe
will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake
with this my weapon drawn I rush'd upon him
surpris'd him suddenly and brought him hither
to use as you think needful of the man

O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil
that robb'd Andronicus of his good hand
this is the pearl that pleas'd your empress' eye
and here's the base fruit of his burning lust
say wall-ey'd slave whither wouldst thou convey
this growing image of thy fiend-like face
why dost not speak What deaf not a word
a halter soldiers hang him on this tree

touch not the boy he is of royal blood

too like the sire for ever being good
first hang the child that he may see it sprawl
a sight to vex the father's soul withal
get me a ladder


Lucius save the child
and bear it from me to the empress
if thou do this I'll show thee wondrous things
that highly may advantage thee to hear
if thou wilt not befall what may befall
I'll speak no more but Vengeance rot you all

say on and if it please me which thou speak'st
thy child shall live and I will see it nourish'd

'Twill vex'thy soul to hear what I shall speak
for I must talk of murders rapes and massacres
acts of black night abominable deeds
complots of mischief treason villanies
ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd
and this shall all be buried by my death
unless thou swear to me my child shall live

tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live

swear that he shall and then I will begin

who should I swear by thou believ'st no god
that granted how canst thou believe an oath

what if I do not as indeed I do not
yet for I know thou art religious
and hast a thing within thee called conscience
with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
therefore I urge thy oath for that I know
an idiot holds his bauble for a god
and keeps the oath which by that god he swears
to that I'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow
by that same god what god soe'er it be
that thou ador'st and hast in reverence
to save my boy to nourish and bring him up
or else I will discover nought to thee

even by my god I swear to thee I will

first know thou I begot him on the empress

O most insatiate and luxurious woman

tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity
to that which thou shalt hear of me anon
'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus
they cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her

O detestable villain call'st thou that trimming

why she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and twas
trim sport for them that had the doing of it

O barbarous beastly villains like thyself

indeed I was their tutor to instruct them
that codding spirit had they from their mother
as sure a card as ever won the set
that bloody mind I think they learn'd of me
as true a dog as ever fought at head
well let my deeds be witness of my worth
I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay
I wrote the letter that thy father found
and hid the gold within the letter mention'd
confederate with the queen and her two sons
wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand
and when I had it drew myself apart
and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
when for his hand he had his two sons' heads
beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily
that both mine eyes were rainy like to his
and when I told the empress of this sport
she swounded almost at my pleasing tale
and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses

what canst thou say all this and never blush

ay like a black dog as the saying is

art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds

ay that I had not done a thousand more
few come within the compass of my curse
wherein I did not some notorious ill
as kill a man or else devise his death
ravish a maid or plot the way to do it
accuse some innocent and forswear myself
set deadly enmity between two friends
make poor men's cattle break their necks
set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night
and bid the owners quench them with their tears
oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves
and set them upright at their dear friends' doors
even when their sorrows almost were forgot
and on their skins as on the bark of trees
have with my knife carved in Roman letters
'Let not your sorrow die though I am dead
tut I have done a thousand dreadful things
as willingly as one would kill a fly
and nothing grieves me heartily indeed
but that I cannot do ten thousand more
bring down the devil for he must not die
so sweet a death as hanging presently

if there be devils would I were a devil
to live and burn in everlasting fire
so I might have your company in hell
but to torment you with my bitter tongue

sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more


my lord there is a messenger from Rome
desires to be admitted to your presence

let him come near

welcome milius what's the news from Rome

lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths
and for he understands you are in arms
he craves a parley at your father's house
willing you to demand your hostages
and they shall be immediately deliver'd

what says our general

milius let the emperor give his pledges
unto my father and my uncle Marcus
and we will come March away


thus in this strange and sad habiliment
I will encounter with Andronicus
and say I am Revenge sent from below
to join with him and right his heinous wrongs
knock at his study where they say he keeps
to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge
tell him Revenge is come to join with him

who doth molest my contemplation
is it your trick to make me ope the door
that so my sad decrees may fly away
and all my study be to no effect
you are deceiv'd for what I mean to do
see here in bloody lines I have set down
and what is written shall be executed

Titus I am come to talk with thee

no not a word how can I grace my talk
wanting a hand to give it action
thou hast the odds of me therefore no more

if thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me

I am not mad I know thee well enough
witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines
witness the tiring day and heavy night
witness all sorrow that I know thee well
for our proud empress mighty Tamora
is not thy coming for my other hand

know thou sad man I am not Tamora
she is thy enemy and I thy friend
I am Revenge sent from the infernal kingdom
to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes
come down and welcome me to this world's light
confer with me of murder and of death
there's not a hollow cave or lurking-place
no vast obscurity or misty vale
where bloody murder or detested rape
can couch for fear but I will find them out
and in their ears tell them my dreadful name
revenge which makes the foul offender quake

to be a torment to mine enemies

I am therefore come down and welcome me

do me some service ere I come to thee
lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands
now give some surance that thou art Revenge
stab them or tear them on thy chariot-wheels
and then I'll come and be thy waggoner
and whirl along with thee about the globe
provide two proper palfreys black as jet
to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away
and find out murderers in their guilty caves
and when thy car is loaden with their heads
I will dismount and by the waggon-wheel
trot like a servile footman all day long
even from Hyperion's rising in the east
until his very downfall in the sea
and day by day I'll do this heavy task

these are my ministers and come with me

are these thy ministers what are they call'd

Rapine and Murder therefore called so
cause they take vengeance of such kind of men

good Lord how like the empress' sons they are
and you the empress but we worldly men
have miserable mad mistaking eyes
O sweet Revenge now do I come to thee
and if one arm's embracement will content thee
I will embrace thee in it by and by


this closing with him fits his lunacy
whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits
do you uphold and maintain in your speeches
and being credulous in this mad thought
I'll make him send for Lucius his son
and whilst I at a banquet hold him sure
I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
to scatter and disperse the giddy Goths
or at the least make them his enemies
see here he comes and I must ply my theme


long have I been forlorn and all for thee
welcome dread Fury to my woeful house
Rapine and Murder you are welcome too
how like the empress and her sons you are
well are you fitted had you but a Moor
could not all hell afford you such a devil
for well I wot the empress never wags
but in her company there is a Moor
and would you represent our queen aright
it were convenient you had such a devil

what wouldst thou have us do Andronicus

show me a murderer I'll deal with him

show me a villain that hath done a rape
and I am sent to be reveng'd on him

show me a thousand that have done thee wrong
and I will be revenged on them all

look round about the wicked streets of Rome
and when thou find'st a man that's like thyself
good Murder stab him he's a murderer
go thou with him and when it is thy hap
to find another that is like to thee
good Rapine stab him he's a ravisher
go thou with them and in the emperor's court
there is a queen attended by a Moor
for up and down she doth resemble thee
I pray thee do on them some violent death
they have been violent to me and mine

well hast thou lesson'd us this shall we do
but would it please thee good Andronicus
to send for Lucius thy thrice-valiant son
who leads towards Rome a band of war-like Goths
and bid him come and banquet at thy house
when he is here even at thy solemn feast
I will bring in the empress and her sons
the emperor himself and all thy foes
and at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel
and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
what says Andronicus to this device

Marcus my brother tis sad Titus calls


thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths
bid him repair to me and bring with him
some of the chiefest princes of the Goths
bid him encamp his soldiers where they are
tell him the emperor and the empress too
feast at my house and he shall feast with them
this do thou for my love and so let him

as he regards his aged father's life

this will I do and soon return again


now will I hence about thy business
and take my ministers along with me

nay nay let Rape and Murder stay with me
or else I'll call my brother back again
and cleave to no revenge but Lucius
what say you boys will you abide with him
whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
how I have govern'd our determin'd jest
yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair
and tarry with him till I turn again

I know them all though they suppose me mad
and will o'er-reach them in their own devices
a pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam

madam depart at pleasure leave us here

farewell Andronicus Revenge now goes
to lay a complot to betray thy foes


I know thou dost and sweet Revenge farewell

tell us old man how shall we be employ'd
tut I have work enough for you to do
Publius come hither Caius and Valentine


what is your will

know you these two

the empress' sons
I take them Chiron and Demetrius

fie Publius fie thou art too much deceiv'd
the one is Murder Rape is the other's name
and therefore bind them gentle Publius
Caius and Valentine lay hands on them
oft have you heard me wish for such an hour
and now I find it therefore bind them sure
and stop their mouths if they begin to cry

villains forbear we are the empress' sons

and therefore do we what we are commanded
stop close their mouths let them not speak a word
is he sure bound look that you bind them fast


come come Lavinia look thy foes are bound
sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me
but let them hear what fearful words I utter
O villains Chiron and Demetrius
here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud
this goodly summer with your winter mix'd
you kill'd her husband and for that vile fault
two of her brothers were condemn'd to death
my hand cut off and made a merry jest
both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear
than hands or tongue her spotless chastity
inhuman traitors you constrain'd and forc'd
villains for shame you could not beg for grace
hark wretches how I mean to martyr you
this one hand yet is left to cut your throats
whilst that Levinia tween her stumps doth hold
the basin that receives your guilty blood
you know your mother means to feast with me
and calls herself Revenge and thinks me mad
hark villains I will grind your bones to dust
and with your blood and it I'll make a paste
and of the paste a coffin I will rear
and make two pasties of your shameful heads
and bid that strumpet your unhallow'd dam
like to the earth swallow her own increase
this is the feast that I have bid her to
and this the banquet she shall surfeit on
for worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter
and worse than Procne I will be reveng'd
and now prepare your throats Lavinia come

let me go grind their bones to powder small
and with this hateful liquor temper it
and in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd
come come be every one officious
to make this banquet which I wish may prove
more stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast
so now bring them in for I will play the cook
and see them ready gainst their mother comes


uncle Marcus since it is my father's mind
that I repair to Rome I am content

and ours with thine befall what fortune will

good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor
this ravenous tiger this accursed devil
let him receive no sustenance fetter him
till he be brought unto the empress' face
and see the ambush of our friends be strong
I fear the emperor means no good to us

some devil whisper curses in mine ear
and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
the venomous malice of my swelling heart

away inhuman dog unhallow'd slave
sirs help our uncle to convey him in

the trumpets show the emperor is at hand


what hath the firmament more suns than one

what boots it thee to call thyself a sun

Rome's emperor and nephew break the parle
these quarrels must be quietly debated
hath ordain'd to an honourable end
for peace for love for league and good to Rome
please you therefore draw nigh and take your places

Marcus we will


welcome my gracious lord welcome dread queen
welcome ye war-like Goths welcome Lucius
and welcome all Although the cheer be poor
'Twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it

why art thou thus attir'd Andronicus

because I would be sure to have all well
to entertain your highness and your empress

we are beholding to you good Andronicus

my lord the emperor resolve me this
was it well done of rash Virginius
to slay his daughter with his own right hand
because she was enforced stain'd and deflower'd

it was Andronicus

your reason mighty lord

because the girl should not survive her shame
and by her presence still renew his sorrows

a reason mighty strong and effectual
a pattern precedent and lively warrant
for me most wretched to perform the like
die die Lavinia and thy shame with thee
and with thy shame thy father's sorrow die



kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind
I am as woeful as Virginius was
and have a thousand times more cause than he
to do this outrage and it is now done

what was she ravish'd tell who did the deed

will t please you eat will t please your highness feed

why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus

not I twas Chiron and Demetrius
they ravish'd her and cut away her tongue
and they twas they that did her all this wrong

go fetch them hither to us presently

why there they are both baked in that pie
eating the flesh that she herself hath bred
'Tis true tis true witness my knife's sharp point


die frantic wretch for this accursed deed


can the son's eye behold his father bleed
there's meed for meed death for a deadly deed

you sad-fac'd men people and sons of Rome
by uproar sever'd like a flight of fowl
scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts
O let me teach you how to knit again
this scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf
these broken limbs again into one body
lest Rome herself be bane unto herself
and she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to
like a forlorn and desperate castaway
but if my frosty signs and chaps of age
grave witnesses of true experience
cannot induce you to attend my words


speak Rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor
when with his solemn tongue he did discourse
to love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
the story of that baleful burning night
when subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy
tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears
or who hath brought the fatal engine in
that gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound
my heart is not compact of flint nor steel
nor can I utter all our bitter grief
but floods of tears will drown my oratory
and break my very utterance even in the time
when it should move you to attend me most
lending your kind commiseration
your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak

then noble auditory be it known to you
that cursed Chiron and Demetrius
were they that murdered our emperor's brother
and they it was that ravished our sister
for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded
our father's tears despis'd and basely cozen'd
of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
and sent her enemies unto the grave
lastly myself unkindly banished
the gates shut on me and turn'd weeping out
to beg relief among Rome's enemies
who drown'd their enmity in my true tears
and op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend
and I am the turn'd forth be it known to you
that have preserv'd her welfare in my blood
and from her bosom took the enemy's point
sheathing the steel in my adventurous body
my scars can witness dumb although they are
that my report is just and full of truth
but soft methinks I do digress too much
citing my worthless praise O pardon me
for when no friends are by men praise themselves

now is my turn to speak Behold this child
of this was Tamora delivered
the issue of an irreligious Moor
chief architect and plotter of these woes
the villain is alive in Titus' house
damn'd as he is to witness this is true
now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
these wrongs unspeakable past patience
or more than any living man could bear
now you have heard the truth what say you Romans
have we done aught amiss show us wherein
and from the place where you behold us now
the poor remainder of Andronici
and on the ragged stones beat forth our brains
and make a mutual closure of our house
speak Romans speak and if you say we shall
lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall

come come thou reverend man of Rome
and bring our emperor gently in thy hand
Lucius our emperor for well I know
the common voice do cry it shall be so

Lucius all hail Rome's royal emperor

go go into old Titus' sorrowful house
and hither hale that misbelieving Moor
to be adjudg'd some direful slaughtering death
as punishment for his most wicked life

Lucius all hail Rome's gracious governor

to heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe
but gentle people give me aim awhile
for nature puts me to a heavy task
stand all aloof but uncle draw you near
to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk
O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips

these sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face
the last true duties of thy noble son

tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips
O were the sum of these that I should pay
countless and infinite yet would I pay them

come hither boy come come and learn of us
to melt in showers thy grandsire lov'd thee well
many a time he danc'd thee on his knee
sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow
meet and agreeing with thine infancy
in that respect then like a loving child
shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring
because kind nature doth require it so
friends should associate friends in grief and woe
bid him farewell commit him to the grave
do him that kindness and take leave of him

O grandsire grandsire even with all my heart
would I were dead so you did live again
O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping
my tears will choke me if I ope my mouth


you sad Andronici have done with woes
give sentence on this execrable wretch
that hath been breeder of these dire events

set him breast-deep in earth and famish him
if any one relieves or pities him
for the offence he dies This is our doom
some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth

O why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
I am no baby I that with base prayers
I should repent the evils I have done
ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
would I perform if I might have my will
if one good deed in all my life I did
I do repent it from my very soul

some loving friends convey the emperor hence
and give him burial in his father's grave
my father and Lavinia shall forthwith
be closed in our household's monument
as for that heinous tiger Tamora
no funeral rite nor man in mournful weeds
no mournful bell shall ring her burial
her life was beast-like and devoid of pity
and being so shall have like want of pity
see justice done on Aaron that damn'd Moor
by whom our heavy haps had their beginning
then afterwards to order well the state
that like events may ne'er it ruinate
