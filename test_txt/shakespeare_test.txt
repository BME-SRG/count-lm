the pale companion is not for our pomp
thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
to whom you are but as a form in wax
the worst that may befall me in this case
unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
and she is mine and all my right of her
and come Egeus you shall go with me
beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes
swift as a shadow short as any dream
and to that place the sharp Athenian law
keep promise love Look here comes Helena

that he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell
I will my Hermia
as waggish boys in game themselves forswear
first good Peter Quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point
shall break the locks



those be rubies fairy favours
but they do square that all their elves for fear
and sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl

with Ariadne and Antiopa
and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
do you amend it then it lies in you
and for her sake I do rear up her boy
and heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
before milk-white now purple with love's wound
and ere I take this charm off from her sight
do I entice you Do I speak you fair
to leave the city and commit yourself
the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind

may be the lady Thou shalt know the man

worm nor snail do no offence

now much beshrew my manners and my pride
this flower's force in stirring love
I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
dead or asleep I see no blood no wound
so I being young till now ripe not to reason
she sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there
alack where are you speak an if you hear



as true as truest horse that yet would never tire

what angel wakes me from my flowery bed
not so neither but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turn


the moon methinks looks with a watery eye
that work for bread upon Athenian stalls
some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe

I pray thee tell me then that he is well
some true-love turn'd and not a false turn'd true
as the Venus of the sky
why should you think that I should woo in scorn
O Helen goddess nymph perfect divine
and now both rivals to mock Helena
there to remain

we Hermia like two artificial gods

wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
to prove him false that says I love thee not
sweet love
I am as fair now as I was erewhile

lower hark again

in her behalf that scorns your services

and lead these testy rivals so astray


speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head
for if but once thou show me thy grey light
that I may back to Athens by daylight
I'll apply
and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head

O how I love thee how I dote on thee
and gentle Puck take this transformed scalp

and bless it to all fair prosperity
for now our observation is perform'd
crook-knee'd and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls
go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
and now I do bethink me so it is
which in my childhood I did dote upon


yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice
'Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of
it comprehends some bringer of that joy
come now what masques what dances shall we have
we'll none of that that have I told my love
there is not one word apt one player fitted
extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain
where I have come great clerks have purposed
if we offend it is with our good will

whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss
and like Limander am I trusty still

for if I should as lion come in strife

this is old Ninny's tomb Where is my love
I thank thee moon for shining now so bright
beshrew my heart but I pity the man

and thus she moans videlicet
with shears his thread of silk
as much as we this night have overwatch'd
from the presence of the sun

and the owner of it blest
give me your hands if we be friends


he cannot want the best
in his bright radiance and collateral light
save you fair queen
virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves made you lose your city It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost That you were made of is metal to make virgins Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost Tis too cold a companion away with't
that blinking Cupid gossips Now shall he


the king's disease my project may deceive me

mayst thou inherit too Welcome to Paris
exception bid him speak and at this time
on the catastrophe and heel of pastime

no madam tis not so well that I am poor though many of the rich are damned But if I may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world Isbel the woman and I will do as we may
I have been madam a wicked creature as you and all flesh and blood are and indeed I do marry that I may repent
get you gone sir I'll talk with you more anon

doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
and put you in the catalogue of those
my master my dear lord he is and I
against the proclamation of thy passion

I still pour in the waters of my love

had from the conversation of my thoughts

after well enter'd soldiers to return

creaking my shoes on the plain masonry

I would I had so I had broke thy pate
why Doctor She My lord there's one arriv'd


so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
oft does them by the weakest minister
I am not an impostor that proclaim

if I break time or flinch in property
here is my hand the premises observ'd
marry that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions
sir I am a poor friend of yours that loves you






thanks sir all the rest is mute

know'st thou not Bertram
a poor physician's daughter thou dislik'st
I can create the rest virtue and she
believe not thy disdain but presently
a balance more replete


well thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me scurvy old filthy scurvy lord Well I must be patient there is no fettering of authority I'll beat him by my life if I can meet him with any convenience an he were double and double a lord I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of I'll beat him an if I could but meet him again

he wears his honour in a box unseen
I'll to the wars she to her single sorrow

did you find me in yourself sir or were you taught to find me The search sir was profitable and much fool may you find in you even to the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter
what more commands he
then my dial goes not true I took this lark for a bunting


on my particular prepar'd I was not
wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss
upon your Grace's part black and fearful
come here for physic



such is his noble purpose and believe't
that twenty such rude boys might tend upon
to tell him that his sword can never win
of smoky muskets O you leaden messengers
to consolate thine ear Come night end day
a lover of thy drum hater of love
he is too good and fair for Death and me
to this unworthy husband of his wife


that has done worthy service

in the unlawful purpose
he were much goodlier is't not a handsome gentleman



by the hand of a soldier I will undertake it

tokens and letters which she did re-send
by the good aid that I of you shall borrow
to buy his will it would not seem too dear
to chide him from our eaves for he persists
even such as you speak to me


betake thee to thy faith for seventeen poniards
but wilt thou faithfully

no
but take the Highest to witness then pray you tell me
I'll lend it thee my dear but have no power
and I'll be bid by thee
my mother told me just how he would woo
he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition
what will Count Rousillon do then will he travel higher or return again into France
and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample
bring him forth



nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your lordship anon
that is not the duke's letter sir that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence one Diana to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish I pray you sir put it up again




there's place and means for every man alive
you never had a servant to whose trust

I am no great Nebuchadnezzar sir I have not much skill in grass
why sir if I cannot serve you I can serve as great a prince as you are

a scar nobly got or a noble scar is a good livery of honour so belike is that
and you
the king's not here
which I presume shall render you no blame
pray you sir deliver me this paper

when oil and fire too strong for reason's force
we are reconcil'd and the first view shall kill

durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
destroy our friends and after weep their dust


that she would never put it from her finger

your highness with herself
what woman's that
if you shall marry
ask him upon his oath if he does think
that ring's a thousand proofs
she hath that ring of yours
I have it not
is this the man you speak of

ay my good lord

wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while
dead though she be she feels her young one kick
will you be mine now you are doubly won
thou keptst a wife herself thyself a maid

ay better than he I am before knows me I know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence
get you with him you old dog


let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally


I answer you
there comes an old man and his three sons
but is there any else longs to feel this broken music in his sides is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin

the little strength that I have I would it were with you
I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg

ere he should thus have ventur'd
is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
high commendation true applause and love
and pity her for her good father's sake

the duke my father loved his father dearly
so near our public court as twenty miles
thou art thy father's daughter there's enough
rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together

to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
a gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh
he'll go along o'er the wide world with me
which like the toad ugly and venomous
than doth your brother that hath banish'd you
O yes into a thousand similes
and did you leave him in this contemplation

what my young master O my gentle master
your brother no no brother yet the son
I rather will subject me to the malice
in all your business and necessities
at seventeen years many their fortunes seek

'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
in mangled forms O that I were a fool
to speak my mind and I will through and through

then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock
with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves
no I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind' on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind if I could meet that fancy-monger I would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him
love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel



we must be married or we must live in bawdry
but have I not cause to weep
do you think so
praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard
some scar of it lean but upon a rush
over the wretched What though you have no beauty
but mistress know yourself down on your knees
come sister Shepherdess look on him better
were both extermin'd
a scatter'd smile and that I'll live upon
a little riper and more lusty red
I will be bitter with him and passing short







you have simply misused our sex in your love-prate we must have your doublot and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest
sing it tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough
my gentle Phebe did bid me give you this
come come you are a fool

if the scorn of your bright eyne
do you pity him no he deserves no pity Wilt thou love such a woman What to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured Well go your way to her for I see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not I will never have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company
it is no boast being ask'd to say we are

whose heart within her bosom is
nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she

thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine
welcome young man

I am for other than for dancing measures

too bad for bad report and he that hath her
but had his titles by Tenantius whom
for whom he now is banish'd her own price

that set thee on to this desert am bound
but when to my good lord I prove untrue
and greets your highness dearly
in all that I can do
not so allur'd to feed
to give him welcome
a Gallian girl at home he furnaces
in you which I account his beyond all talents
that others do
that mount the Capitol join gripes with hands
with pity that doth make me sick A lady
in your despite upon your purse Revenge it
a saucy stranger in his court to mart
you make amends

to send them to you only for this night
send your trunk to me it shall safe be kept

there's an Italian come and tis thought one of Leonatus' friends

of that most delicate lodging by my life

when I was stamp'd some coiner with his tools
ambitions covetings change of prides disdain

that we two are asunder let that grieve him

prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk

the gods will diet me with Prithee away


how it goes here It fits us therefore ripely
since the exile of Posthumus most retir'd
she wish'd me to make known but our great court
or wing'd with fervour of her love she's flown
outsells them all I love her therefore but
thy heart to find it Is she with Posthumus
then sir

be those the garments
I see a man's life is a tedious one
plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever
I am weak with toil yet strong in appetite
gold strew'd i' the floor Here's money for my meat

after a long absence such is yours most welcome

thanks sir

my brother hath done well
I love thee brotherly but envy much
in these two princely boys They are as gentle


thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber
the azur'd hare-bell like thy veins no nor

unless my sins abuse my divination
in this sad wrack How came it Who is it
they'll pardon it Say you sir
and leaving so his service follow you
the great part of my comfort gone my queen
and will no doubt be found
that long to move

which we have done whose answer would be death
the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
so long a poor unknown
yea bloody cloth I'll keep thee for I wish'd
I'll give no wound to thee Therefore good heavens
in my profession Knighthoods and honours borne

merely through fear that the strait pass was damm'd
but to look back in frown stand stand These three
o'er-borne i' the former wave ten chas'd by one
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too

the penitent instrument to pick that bolt

a thing of pity

is that one of the four complexions
her faults will ne'er be known
and that's great marvel loving a light wench
lord how wise you are

I do affect the very ground which is base where her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which is basest doth tread I shall be forsworn which is a great argument of falsehood if I love And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted Love is a familiar Love is a devil there is no evil angel but Love Yet was Samson so tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier The first and second clause will not serve my turn the passado he respects not the duello he regards not his disgrace is to be called boy but his glory is to subdue men Adieu valour rust rapier be still drum for your manager is in love yea he loveth Assist me some extemporal god of rime for I am sure I shall turn sonneter Devise wit write pen for I am for whole volumes in folio

O you beast

no indeed will I not Pompey it is not the wear I will pray Pompey to increase your bondage if you take it not patiently why your mettle is the more Adieu trusty Pompey Bless you friar
some say he is with the Emperor of Russia other some he is in Rome but where is he think you
why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a cod-piece to take away the life of a man Would the duke that is absent have done this Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy
a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
I'll be hanged first thou art deceived in me friar But no more of this Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no
a bawd of eleven years' continuance may it please your honour


so disguise shall by the disguis'd
let me excuse me and believe me so
that makes his opening with this bigger key
I have a servant comes with me along
who hath a story ready for your ear
but my entreaty too
come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer To-morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine Here is in our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been a notorious bawd
painting sir I have heard say is a mystery and your whores sir being members of my occupation using painting do prove my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be in hanging if I should be hanged I cannot imagine

heaven give your spirits comfort


this is his lordship's man

he wants advice
were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
master Barnardine you must rise and be hanged Master Barnardine
is the axe upon the block sirrah
O sir you must and therefore I beseech you look forward on the journey you shall go
one Ragozine a most notorious pirate
put them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudio



say by this token I desire his company


good night

that is your part yet I'm advis'd to do it
the duke is ent'ring therefore hence away
a forted residence gainst the tooth of time
reveal yourself to him
a hypocrite a virgin-violator
as Angelo even so may Angelo

I wish you now then



but yesternight my lord she and that friar
my lord most villanously believe it
give us some seats Come cousin Angelo
why you

this is a strange abuse Let's see thy face
my lord I must confess I know this woman


cucullus non facit monachum honest in nothing but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most villanous speeches of the duke
that's the way for women are light at midnight
where is the duke tis he should hear me speak
and then to glance from him to the duke himself

away with him to prison Where is the provost
what you have spoke I pardon sit you down
say wast thou e'er contracted to this woman
your unknown sovereignty
whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
it is your husband mock'd you with a husband

most bounteous sir
it was commanded so
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio
sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
I beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore Your highness said even now I made you a duke good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold
I have a motion much imports your good
he hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it
he set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading the challenge subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the bird-bolt I pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars But how many hath he killed for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing
is't possible
Don Pedro is approached


do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex
is't come to this i' faith Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again Go to i' faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you


I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so I commit you
O my lord
but lest my liking might too sudden seem
he is very busy about it But brother I can tell you strange news that you yet dreaint not of






I say my prayers aloud
you could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man Here's his dry hand up and down you are he you are he
not I believe me

'Tis certain so the prince woos for himself


none but to desire your good company


there's little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing
and I my lord

be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me

nay pray thee come
converting all your sounds of woe







bear thee well in it and leave us alone

and did they bid you tell her of it madam
she is so self-endear'd

she cannot be so much without true judgment
which is the best to furnish me to-morrow
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Arragon
you must hang it first and draw it afterwards
nay a' rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that
she shall be buried with her face upwards



you have I knew it would be your answer Well for your favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn This is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince's name
if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty
nay by r lady that I think a' cannot
mass and my elbow itched I thought there would a scab follow
I mean the fashion
two of them did the prince and Claudio but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander that Don John had made away went Claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw o'er night and send her home again without a husband

O that exceeds they say





I'll wait upon them I am ready


what do you mean my lord
you seem to me as Dian in her orb
true O God
with any just reproach
not to be spoke of
come let us go These things come thus to light
yea wherefore should she not
that I myself was to myself not mine
would the two princes lie and Claudio lie


your daughter here the princes left for dead
why then we rack the value then we find
and if it sort not well you may conceal her


you have stayed me in a happy hour


marry that am I and my partner

master constable
this is all

which they themselves not feel but tasting it
yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
are you so hasty now well all is one
what I have done being young or what would do
despite his nice fence and his active practice
as I dare take a serpent by the tongue
my heart is sorry for your daughter's death


sir your wit ambles well it goes easily

marry sir they have committed false report moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves

no not so villain thou beliest thyself
possess the people in Messina here
shall face to face be brought to Margaret


the god of love


gives her fame which never dies
yearly will I do this rite
upon the error that you heard debated
which I will do with confirm'd countenance
in the state of honourable marriage
good morrow Benedick Why what's the matter


do not you love me
fashion'd to Beatrice

and lords and ladies in their lives
bad child worse father to entice his own

that hath inflam'd desire in my breast
that without covering save yon field of stars
I wait the sharpest blow
as you will live resolve it you
as dangerous as the rest Your time's expir'd
then give my tongue like leave to love my head
then were it certain you were not so bad
to take his head
my lord tis done

grows elder now and cares it be not done

and then return to us
sit down thou art no flatterer
which by my knowledge found the sinful father
alas sir
but should he wrong my liberties in my absence
you shall not need my fellow peers of Tyre

as friends to Antioch we may feast in Tyre
that if heaven slumber while their creatures want

our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it
and so in ours Some neighbouring nation
I go my lord
the gods of Greece protect you
that will prove awful both in deed and word
sends word of all that haps in Tyre
yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven


he asks of you that never us'd to beg
I thank you sir

which my dead father did bequeath to me
and if that ever my low fortunes better

a model which heaven makes like to itself
a prince of Macedon my royal father

can any way speak in his just commend
were more than you expect or more than's fit

all viands that I eat do seem unsavoury

O attend my daughter
of whence he is his name and parentage
a gentleman of Tyre



wrong not yourself then noble Helicane
take I your wish I leap into the seas
good morrow to the good Simonides
they're well dispatch'd now to my daughter's letter

she thinks not so peruse this writing else
traitor
then as you are as virtuous as fair


by many a dern and painful perch
yravished the regions round
I nill relate action may
of my queen's travails
use honour with you
courage enough I do not fear the flaw
no light no fire the unfriendly elements


shook as the earth' did quake
may the two latter darken and expend
such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay
'Tis so my lord
Apollo perfect me i' the characters

the heavens



I will embrace
madam if this you purpose as you speak
that monster envy oft the wrack
with the dove of Paphos might the crow
with Leonine a murderer

no I pray you
walk half an hour Leonine at least
but cried Good seamen to the sailors galling
I grant it Pray but be not tedious
is not to reason of the deed but do t
come let's have her aboard suddenly

as well as we ay and better too we offend worse Neither is our profession any trade it's no calling But here comes Boult
Boult take you the marks of her the colour of her hair complexion height age with warrant of her virginity and cry He that will give most shall have her first Such a maiden-head were no cheap thing if men were as they have been Get this done as I command you
the more my fault




do like this worst
not worth the time of day It pierc'd me thorough
you are like one that superstitiously
well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought



well call forth call forth



I did not think
I beseech your honour one piece for me
she makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods


that doth frequent your house
and to her father turn our thoughts again
that he have his Call up some gentlemen
being on shore honouring of Neptune's triumphs
may we not see him
we have a maid in Mitylene I durst wager

I'd wish no better choice and think me rarely wed
no nor look'd on us
I will desist
my daughter might have been my queen's square brows
for the crown'd truth to dwell in I believe thee
if thine consider'd prove the thousandth part

at sea what mother
the king my father did in Tarsus leave me
I know not but
though doubts did ever sleep
when thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge

reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife
shall we refresh us sir upon your shore
for such kindness must relieve me
who frighted from my country did wed
this is your wife



more like a god than you Will you deliver

of Pericles to rage the city turn
for since the mortal and intestine jars
why thou departedst from thy native home
and soon and safe arrived where I was
a doubtful warrant of immediate death
at length the sun gazing upon the earth
what to delight in what to sorrow for
my youngest boy and yet my eldest care
against my crown my oath my dignity
therefore give out you are of Epidamnum


the meat is cold because you come not home
if I return I shall be post indeed
or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
what mean you sir for God's sake hold your hands
perhaps some merchant hath invited him
the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls

say didst thou speak with him Know'st thou his mind
'Your meat doth burn quoth I my gold quoth he
back slave or I will break thy pate across
if voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd
will lose his beauty and though gold bides still
you know no Centaur You receiv'd no gold
yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth

no sir I think the meat wants that I have
marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself
the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet be loseth it in a kind of jollity
marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair lost by nature
that thou art thus estranged from thyself
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot
by me
to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner

I'll say as they say and persever so
say what you will sir but I know what I know
good meat sir is common that every churl affords
let him walk from whence he came lest he catch cold on's feet



ay and break it in your face so he break it not behind
once this your long experience of her wisdom
and in despite of mirth mean to be merry

ill deeds are doubled with an evil word
are you a god would you create me new





an if the wind blow any way from shore


or I'll attach you by this officer
I buy a thousand pound a year I buy a rope
and with you take the chain and bid my wife
but like a shrew you first begin to brawl
the money that you owe me for the chain
consent to pay thee that I never had
I have convey'd aboard and I have bought
give her this key and tell her in the desk
of his heart's meteors tilting in his face



no no the bell tis time that I were gone


is that the chain you promis'd me to-day
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone

I'll give thee ere I leave thee so much money
I'll serve you sir five hundred at the rate

alas how fiery and how sharp he looks
revel and feast it at my house to-day
did not her kitchen-maid rail taunt and scorn me
but surely master not a rag of money
and gentle master I receiv'd no gold
to make a rescue


to have them bound again

you have done wrong to this my honest friend

this week he hath been heavy sour sad

and thereof comes it that his head is light
she did betray me to my own reproof
to make of him a formal man again
anon I'm sure the duke himself in person

and with his mad attendant and himself

hark hark I hear him mistress fly be gone
she whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife
O perjur'd woman They are both forsworn
I did obey and sent my peasant home
I gain'd my freedom and immediately
I never came within these abbey walls
as sure my liege as I do see your Grace

I am sure thou dost
thou know'st we parted but perhaps my son
and which the spirit Who deciphers them
that floated with thee on the fatal raft
stay stand apart I know not which is which

I see we still did meet each other's man
of you my sons and till this present hour


be with my hopes abroad I should be still
and in a word but even now worth this
because you are not sad Now by two-headed Janus
good morrow my good lords
a stage where every man must play a part
that therefore only are reputed wise
in a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
I owe the most in money and in love
which you did shoot the first I do not doubt
nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth

then is there the County Palatine
if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father's will if you should refuse to accept him
if I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me Come Nerissa Sirrah go before
Antonio is a good man
he lends out money gratis and brings down
rest you fair good signior
I do never use it
who then conceiving did in eaning time
three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
'Hath a dog money Is it possible
I would be friends with you and have your love


mislike me not for my complexion
yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
and die with grieving
master young man you I pray you which is the way to Master Jew's
but I pray you ergo old man ergo I beseech you talk you of young Master Launcelot
pray you let's have no more fooling about it but give me your blessing I am Launcelot your boy that was your son that is your child that shall be
God bless your worship
one speak for both What would you


Signior Bassanio hear me

to be asham'd to be my father's child


if e'er the Jew her father come to heaven
your worship was wont to tell me that


desir'd us to make stand
how like the prodigal doth she return
for whom love I so much And now who knows
so are you sweet
what art thou come On gentlemen away
now make your choice
a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
to kiss this shrine this mortal-breathing saint
here do I choose and thrive I as I may
cold indeed and labour lost
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica
or he shall pay for this
let it not enter in your mind of love

and so have I address'd me Fortune now
without the stamp of merit Let none presume
how much unlike art thou to Portia
so be gone sir you are sped
where is my lady



what what what ill luck ill luck
out upon her Thou torturest me Tubal it was my turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys
that I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes
there may as well be amity and life
then if he lose he makes a swan-like end

will bless it and approve it with a text
veiling an Indian beauty in a word
fair Portia's counterfeit What demi-god
be content and seek no new
I would not be ambitious in my wish
this house these servants and this same myself
to cry good joy Good joy my lord and lady
with oaths of love at last if promise last
but who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel
and I have reason for it Signior Antonio
that steal the colour from Bassanio's cheek
engag'd my friend to his mere enemy
the duke himself and the magnificoes

since you are dear bought I will love you dear
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond
let him alone
to see me pay his debt and then I care not
being the bosom lover of my lord
madam with all my heart
into my cousin's hand Doctor Bellario
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two
but come I'll tell thee all my whole device
I'll tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comes

he finds the joys of heaven here on earth
well I'll set you forth
go one and call the Jew into the court
from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
cannot contain their urine for affection

let me have judgment and the Jew his will
the pound of flesh which I demand of him

of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee



but mercy is above this sceptred sway
yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
here tis most reverend doctor here it is
there is no power in the tongue of man
ay his breast

Antonio I am married to a wife
we trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence

O Jew an upright judge a learned judge

he seek the life of any citizen
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
upon his death unto the gentleman

have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
you press me far and therefore I will yield

go Gratiano run and overtake him
that cannot be
the moon shines bright in such a night as this



my friend Stephano signify I pray you

the motions of his spirit are dull as night
methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day

this night methinks is but the daylight sick
no more than I am well acquitted of
that you would wear it till your hour of death
and riveted so with faith unto your flesh
not that I hope that you receiv'd of me

I was beset with shame and courtesy
how you do leave me to mine own protection
pardon this fault and by my soul I swear
for that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk
I chanced on this letter

that I were couching with the doctor's clerk
the dozen white louses do become an old coat well it agrees well passant it is a familiar beast to man and signifies love
it is petter that friends is the sword and end it and there is also another device in my prain which peradventure prings goot discretions with it There is Anne Page which is daughter to Master Thomas Page which is pretty virginity
who's there

now Master Shallow you'll complain of me to the king
you Banbury cheese
he hears with ears





I may not go in without your worship they will not sit till you come

well sir



hold sirrah bear you these letters tightly

I'll go watch
how say you O I should remember him does he not hold up his head as it were and strut in his gait
fe fe fe fe ma foi il fait fort chaud Je m'en vais la cour la grande affaire





well I do then yet I say I could show you to the contrary O Mistress Page give me some counsel
boarding call you it I'll be sure to keep him above deck
both young and old one with another Ford
and this is true I like not the humour of lying He hath wronged me in some humours I should have borne the humoured letter to her but I have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity He loves your wife there's the short and the long My name is Corporal Nym I speak and I avouch tis true my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife Adieu I love not the humour of bread and cheese and there's the humour of it Adieu






your worship says very true I pray your worship come a little nearer this ways
ay forsooth and then you may come and see the picture she says that you wot of Master Ford her husband will be from home Alas the sweet woman leads an ill life with him he's a very jealousy man she leads a very frampold life with him good heart
this news distracts me

sir I know not how I may deserve to be your porter
have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands
would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should win what you would enjoy Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously
hang him mechanical salt-butter rogue I will stare him out of his wits I will awe him with my cudgel it shall hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns Master Brook thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant and thou shalt he with his wife Come to me soon at night Ford's a knave and I will aggravate his style thou Master Brook shalt know him for knave and cuckold Come to me soon at night
alas sir I cannot fence


he is there see what humour he is in and I will bring the doctor about by the fields Will it do well


how now Master Parson Good morrow good Sir Hugh Keep a gamester from the dice and a good student from his book and it is wonderful
I have lived fourscore years and upward I never heard a man of his place gravity and learning so wide of his own respect



he he I can never hit on's name There is such a league between my good man and he Is your wife at home indeed
we have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender and this day we shall have our answer
farewell my hearts I will to my honest knight Falstaff and drink canary with him




your husband's coming hither woman with all the officers of Windsor to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house by your consent to take an ill advantage of his absence you are undone

this is fery fantastical humours and jealousies

ay ay I must bear it
if there is one I shall make two in the company
and that my state being gall'd with my expense
cannot attain it why then hark you hither
she's coming to her coz O boy thou hadst a father
now good Mistress Anne
she is no match for you



well she laments sir for it that it would yearn your heart to see it Her husband goes this morning a-birding she desires you once more to come to her between eight and nine I must carry her word quickly she'll make you amends I warrant you
now Master Brook you come to know what hath passed between me and Ford's wife
you shall hear As good luck would have it comes in one Mistress Page gives intelligence of Ford's approach and in her invention and Ford's wife's distraction they conveyed me into a buck-basket





mistress Ford your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance I see you are obsequious in your love and I profess requital to a hair's breadth not only Mistress Ford in the simple office of love but in all the accoutrement complement and ceremony of it But are you sure of your husband now
why


we'll try that for I'll appoint my men to carry the basket again to meet him at the door with it as they did last time
I hope not I had as lief bear so much lead
this passes
master Ford you must pray and not follow the imaginations of your own heart this is jealousies
come Mother Prat come give me your hand
trust me he beat him most pitifully

'Tis well tis well no more
sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest
and in this shape when you have brought him thither
let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
potent at court he none but he shall have her


ay that there was mine host one that hath taught me more wit than ever I learned before in my life and I paid nothing for it neither but was paid for my learning
here Master doctor in perplexity and doubtful dilemma
sir let me speak with you in your chamber you shall hear how things go and I warrant to your content Here is a letter will say somewhat Good hearts what ado here is to bring you together Sure one of you does not serve heaven well that you are so crossed
that neither singly can be manifested
she seemingly obedient likewise hath
to give our hearts united ceremony





the expressure that it bears green let it be
with trial-fire touch me his finger-end
fed in heart whose flames aspire
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass
why Sir John do you think though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell that ever the devil could have made you our delight
nay husband let that go to make amends
upon my life then you took the wrong

and this deceit loses the name of craft
and laugh this sport o'er by a country fire
I know my remedy I must go fetch the third-borough
to-morrow I intend to hunt again
it would seem strange unto him when he wak'd
and that his lady mourns at his disease
how now who is it

let them want nothing that my house affords
no better than a poor and loathsome beggar

hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house

thou hast a lady far more beautiful
O that once more you knew but what you are
and Peter Turf and Henry Pimpernell



here let us breathe and haply institute
glad that you thus continue your resolve
but stay awhile what company is this
unless you were of gentler milder mould

why will you mew her up
what shall I be appointed hours as though belike
I cannot tell but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whipped at the high-cross every morning
assist me Tranio for I know thou wilt
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din

we have not yet been seen in any house
because so well I love Lucentio
wait you on him I charge you as becomes
my lord you nod you do not mind the play

con tutto il cuore ben trovato may I say
and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
Signior Hortensio twixt such friends as we
her only fault and that is faults enough
to give you over at this first encounter

all books of love see that at any hand

and that his bags shall prove
and I do hope good days and long to see
and do you tell me of a woman's tongue
tell me I beseech you which is the readiest way
and if I be sir is it any offence
and were his daughter fairer than she is
sir sir the first's for me let her go by
and since you do profess to be a suitor
unbind my hands I'll pull them off myself
is it for him you do envy me so
what will you not suffer me Nay now I see

you're welcome sir and he for your good sake

and toward the education of your daughters
these are their tutors bid them use them well
in all my lands and leases whatsoever
that shake not though they blow perpetually
and through the instrument my pate made way
say that she rail why then I'll tell her plain
but Kate the prettiest Kate in Christendom



why here's no crab and therefore look not sour
nay hear you Kate in sooth you scape not so
go fool and whom thou keep'st command
that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
call you me daughter now I promise you
is this your speeding nay then good night our part
God send you joy Petruchio tis a match
the gain I seek is quiet in the match
'Tis deeds must win the prize and he of both
and if I die to-morrow this is hers
than three great argosies besides two galliasses
well gentlemen
I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio
then give me leave to read philosophy


good masters take it not unkindly pray
why I am past my gamut long ago

to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
though he be blunt I know him passing wise

I am glad he is come howsoe'er he comes

first were we sad fearing you would not come
not I believe me thus I'll visit her

we'll over-reach the greybeard Gremio
tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
you would entreat me rather go than stay


my horse my ox my ass my anything
I warrant him Petruchio is Kated




how now old lad
here sir as foolish as I was before


you heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves

last night she slept not nor to-night she shall not
sir to satisfy you in what I have said

and here I take the like unfeigned oath
Tranio you jest But have you both forsworn me
to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
take in your love and then let me alone
'Tis death for any one in Mantua

O sir I do and will repute you ever
nor never needed that I should entreat
what say you to a piece of beef and mustard
go get thee gone I say
the poorest service is repaid with thanks


thy gown why ay come tailor let us see't
more quaint more pleasing nor more commendable




because his painted skin contents the eye

imagine twere the right Vincentio

doth love my daughter and she loveth him
send for your daughter by your servant here



an if you please to call it a rush-candle

why how now Kate I hope thou art not mad
what is his name



I hope I may choose sir



that have by marriage made thy daughter mine
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the gaol

brother Petruchio sister Katharina
you are very sensible and yet you miss my sense
your husband being troubled with a shrew

she hath prevented me Here Signior Tranio
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright

that she is busy and she cannot come
now where's my wife
now by my holidame here comes Katharina

fie what a foolish duty call you this
and dart not scornful glances from those eyes
and when she's froward peevish sullen sour
and place your hands below your husband's foot
now go thy ways thou hast tam'd a curst shrew

a pox o' your throat you bawling blasphemous incharitable dog



so safely order'd that there is no soul
by what by any other house or person

my brother and thy uncle call'd Antonio
or else new form'd em having both the key
who having into truth by telling of it

the gates of Milan and i' the dead of darkness
a mark so bloody on the business but
against what should ensue
sit still and hear the last of our sea-sorrow

then meet and join Jove's lightnings the precursors
why that's my spirit
safely in harbour
must by us both be spent most preciously
from what a torment I did free thee
sir in Argier
into a cloven pine within which rift

and hither come in't go hence with diligence

drop on you both a south-west blow on ye
of Sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
one thing or other when thou didst not savage

hark hark I hear

and strays about to find em

and his more braver daughter could control thee

come
and make thy weapon drop


the masters of some merchant and the merchant







the surge most swoln that met him his bold head
which end o' the beam should bow We have lost your son
foul weather
no use of metal corn or wine or oil
I would with such perfection govern sir

it is a comforter
worthy Sebastian O what might No more

by their own fear or sloth
what great hope have you no hope that way is
whereof what's past is prologue what to come

and melt ere they molest Here lies your brother
to fall it on Gonzalo
preserve the king



she lov'd not the savour of tar nor of pitch



I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster A most scurvy monster I could find in my heart to beat him

there be some sports are painful and their labour
pray set it down and rest you when this burns
with much more ease for my good will is to it
the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
I therein do forget



how does thy honour Let me lick thy shoe I'll not serve him he is not valiant
thou liest

didst thou not say he hed
why as I told thee tis a custom with him
ay lord she will become thy bed I warrant
at thy request monster I will do reason any reason Come on Trinculo let us sing
art thou afeard
the sound is going away let's follow it and after do our work
I am right glad that he's so out of hope
a living drollery Now I will believe
thou hast said well for some of you there present
dew-lapp'd like bulls whose throats had hanging at them
their proper selves You fools I and my fellows
which here in this most desolate isle else falls

that are of suppler joints follow them swiftly

when I shall think or Ph bus' steeds are founder'd

I warrant you sir
whose watery arch and messenger am I
tell me heavenly bow
great Juno comes I know her by her gait

with your sedg'd crowns and ever-harmless looks

bear with my weakness my old brain is troubled
I thought to have told thee of it but I fear'd
this was well done my bird

I will fetch off my bottle though I be o'er ears for my labour
the dropsy drown this fooll what do you mean
and this
shalt have the air at freedom for a little
and the remainder mourning over them
in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
set roaring war to the dread-rattling thunder
mine eyes even sociable to the show of thine
that yet looks on me or would know me Ariel
there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
whe'r thou beest he or no
believe things certain Welcome my friends all
were wrack'd upon this shore where I have lost

this cell's my court here have I few attendants
a most high miracle
and brought us thus together
I have inly wept
that doth not wish you joy


how fares my gracious sir
mark but the badges of these men my lords

was I to take this drunkard for a god
and thence retire me to my Milan where
or sent to Naples Let me not
home-keeping youth have ever homely wits

with twenty watchful weary tedious nights
and writers say as the most forward bud

indeed a sheep doth very often stray

'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover
why sir how do you bear with me
sir I could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter And being so hard to me that brought your mind I fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind Give her no token but stones for she's as hard as steel
of all the fair resort of gentlemen
how now what means this passion at his name

say say who gave it thee

what would your ladyship

and why not you

look here is writ kind Julia unkind Julia
now kiss embrace contend do what you will
come come will't please you go
to let him spend his time no more at home
there shall be practise tilts and tournaments
sweet love sweet lines sweet life
and how stand you affected to his wish
come on Panthino you shall be employ'd
and yet a thousand times it answers no






and yet I will not name it and yet I care not




and when that hour o'erslips me in the day
nay twill be this hour ere I have done weeping all the kind of the Launces have this very fault I have received my proportion like the prodigious son and am going with Sir Proteus to the imperial's court I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that lives my mother weeping my father wailing my sister crying our maid howling our cat wringing her hands and all our house in a great perplexity yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear He is a stone a very pebble stone and has no more pity in him than a dog a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting why my grandam having no eyes look you wept herself blind at my parting Nay I'll show you the manner of it This shoe is my father no this left shoe is my father no no this left shoe is my mother nay that cannot be so neither yes it is so it is so it hath the worser sole This shoe with the hole in is my mother and this my father A vengeance on't there tis now sir this staff is my sister for look you she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand this hat is Nan our maid I am the dog no the dog is himself and I am the dog O the dog is me and I am myself ay so so Now come I to my father Father your blessing now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping now should I kiss my father well he weeps on Now come I to my mother O that she could speak now like a wood woman Well I kiss her why there tis here's my mother's breath up and down Now come I to my sister mark the moan she makes Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word but see how I lay the dust with my tears

not of you
wise
that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air
no more gentlemen no more Here comes my father
the honour and regard of such a father
as meet to be an emperor's counsellor

if this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from
that you are welcome

there is no woe to his correction
and I must minister the like to you

but she loves you
or as one nail by strength drives out another
if I can check my erring love I will
what are they broken
but tell me true will't be a match
I tell thee my master is become a hot lover
but now I worship a celestial sun
aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend
to lesson me and tell me some good mean



no matter who's displeas'd when you are gone
to bear a hard opinion of his truth
my duty pricks me on to utter that
sir Valentine her company and my court
for love of you not hate unto my friend
I am to break with thee of some affairs
and turn her out to who will take her in

why then I would resort to her by night



but as thou lov'st thy life make speed from hence
but fly I hence I fly away from life


doth Silvia know that I am banished
if so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear
I pray thee Launce and if thou seest my boy






now will he be swing'd for reading my letter An unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets I'll after to rejoice in the boy's correction

and also I think thou art not ignorant

as you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine
much is the force of heaven-bred poesy
and thy advice this night I'll put in practice
if not we'll make you sit and rifle you

but yet I slew him manfully in fight

and partly seeing you are beautified
I take your offer and will live with you
in breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd
ay Silvia for your sake

to her let us garlands bring
not a whit when it jars so
sir Thurio fear not you I will so plead


madam if your heart be so obdurate


as when thy lady and thy true love died
I give consent to go along with you


she lov'd me well deliver'd it to me
'Tis pity love should be so contrary
to plead for that which I would not obtain
from my master Sir Proteus madam

poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
and pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face

if that be all the difference in his love
she will not fail for lovers break not hours
what that my leg is too long
how likes she my discourse
considers she my possessions
saw you my daughter


this shadowy desart unfrequented woods
though you respect not aught your servant doth
I would have been a breakfast to the beast
than plural faith which is too much by one
Valentine
then I am paid
where is that ring boy
behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths

take but possession of her with a touch

with our discourse to make your Grace to smile
I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live
or breed upon our absence that may blow
were there necessity in your request although
but let him say so then and let him go
you put me off with limber vows but I


Hermione my dearest thou never spok'st
why that was when
as now they are and making practis'd smiles
to be full like me yet they say we are

this squash this gentleman Mine honest friend
how thou lov'st us show in our brother's welcome
go play boy play thy mother plays and I
have the disease and feel't not How now boy

business my lord I think most understand
in that which seems so
it was my folly if industriously
or else be impudently negative
blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
inclining to them both were my wife's liver
I could do this and that with no rash potion
provided that when he's remov'd your highness



by my regard but kill'd none so Camillo

to vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen

I saw his heart in's face Give me thy hand

who taught you this
I am for you again pray you sit by us

with violent hefts I have drunk and seen the spider

which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
and mannerly distinguishment leave out
the centre is not big enough to bear
my women may be with me for you see
please you to accept it that the queen is spotless
I have three daughters the eldest is eleven


though I am satisfied and need no more
what dost thou then in prison

how fares our gracious lady
the trumpet any more Pray you Emilia
tell her Emilia

'Tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd

that presses him from sleep
commit me for committing honour trust it

traitors
I am none by this good light
and might we lay the old proverb to your charge

if she did know me one Away with her
shall I dash out Go take it to the fire
I am a feather for each wind that blows
thou wilt perform my bidding
had been more merciful Come on poor babe
so please you sir their speed
methinks I so should term them and the reverence
the violent carriage of it

and play'd to take spectators For behold me
that any of these bolder vices wanted
even since it could speak from an infant freely
which to deny concerns more than avails for as
to women of all fashion lastly hurried
O that he were alive and here beholding
Hermione is chaste Polixenes blameless Camillo a true subject Leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten and the king shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found
the prince your son with mere conceit and fear

does my deeds make the blacker
that did but show thee of a fool inconstant
I say she's dead I'll swear't if word nor oath

to the dead bodies of my queen and son
their sacred wills be done Go get aboard
so like a waking To me comes a creature
this was so and no slumber Dreams are toys
well may I get aboard This is the chase
now now I have not winked since I saw these sights the men are not yet cold under water nor the bear half dined on the gentleman he's at it now
I that please some try all both joy and terror
in fair Bohemia and remember well

for a quart of ale is a dish for a king
my traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen My father named me Autolycus who being as I am littered under Mercury was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles With die and drab I purchased this caparison and my revenue is the silly cheat Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway beating and hanging are terrors to me for the life to come I sleep out the thought of it A prize a prize
alas poor man a million of beating may come to a great matter


your sad tares in a mile-a
when my good falcon made her flight across
as I seem now Their transformations
strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
with labour and the thing she took to quench it
and welcome to our shearing

this youth should say twere well and only therefore
that come before the swallow dares and take


Mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic
who loves another best
he hath ribands of all the colours i' the rainbow points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle though they come to him by the gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns why he sings em over as they were gods or goddesses You would think a smock were a she-angel he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't
what maids lack from head to heel



if to either thou dost ill
or lace for your cape
why they stay at door sir

and this my neighbour too
so well nothing so well no nor mean better


no he must not
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made
I was not much afeard for once or twice
where no priest shovels in dust O cursed wretch

will thereto be obedient I have reason
and most opportune to our need I have
and that unhappy king my master whom
if your more ponderous and settled project
but as the unthought-on accident is guilty
worthy Camillo
to miseries enough no hope to help you

that you may know you shall not want one word







think you so sir
O that's the case of the shepherd's son hang him he'll be made an example
whilst I remember
not at all good lady
there is none worthy
who hast the memory of Hermione
to murder her I married
you tempt him over much
shall be when your first queen's again in breath
ay the most peerless piece of earth I think

when I shall see this gentleman thy speeches
once more to look on him
at least ungentle of the dreadful Neptune

fled from his father from his hopes and with

my lord
my father will grant precious things as trifles





that which my daughter came to look upon
Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing

will piece up in himself

could ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me

dear life redeems you You perceive she stirs

lest they desire upon this push to trouble
what look upon my brother both your pardons
the ravish'd Helen Menelaus' queen
to what may be digested in a play


writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
because she's kin to me therefore she's not so fair as Helen an she were not kin to me she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday But what care I I care not an she were a black-a-moor tis all one to me
but Pandarus O gods how do you plague me


they call him Ajax
Hector's a gallant man

then you say as I say for I am sure he is not Hector
pardon me pardon me
to say the truth true and not true
is he so young a man and so old a lifter
if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i' the shell
at what was all this laughing
so I do

look ye yonder niece is't not a gallant man too is't not Why this is brave now Who said he came hurt home to-day he's not hurt why this will do Helen's heart good now ha Would I could see Troilus now You shall see Troilus anon
mark him note him O brave Troilus look well upon him niece look you how his sword is bloodied and his helmet more hacked than Hector's and how he looks and how he goes O admirable youth he ne'er saw three-and-twenty Go thy way Troilus go thy way Had I a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess he should take his choice O admirable man Paris Paris is dirt to him and I warrant Helen to change would give an eye to boot

I'll be with you niece by and by
then though my heart's content firm love doth bear
that gave't surmised shape Why then you princes
upon her patient breast making their way
Agamemnon

office and custom in all line of order
but by degree stand in authentic place
that by a pace goes backward with a purpose
grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard

of their observant toil the enemies' weight
is this great Agamemnon's tent I pray you
modest as morning when she coldly eyes

send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
than ever Greek did compass in his arms
one noble man that hath one spark of fire

however it is spread in general name
our imputation shall be oddly pois'd
therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector
the sort to fight with Hector among ourselves
Thersites
I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book Thou canst strike canst thou a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks
thou shouldst strike him

but yet you look not well upon him for whosoever you take him to be he is Ajax




more ready to cry out Who knows what follows
with spans and inches so diminutive
with this cramm'd reason reason and respect
two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores
if you'll avouch twas wisdom Paris went
cry Trojans


sir I propose not merely to myself
have gloz'd but superficially not much
of nature and of nations speak aloud
so rich advantage of a promis'd glory

O tell tell
Patroclus I'll speak with nobody Come in with me Thersites
he is not sick

do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss

why should a man be proud How doth pride grow I know not what pride is

that bastes his arrogance with his own seam
if I go to him with my armed fist
he will be the physician that should be the patient
you must prepare to fight without Achilles






nay this shall not hedge us out we'll hear you sing certainly
what exploit's in hand where sups he to-night
my niece is horribly in love with a thing you have sweet queen


they're come from field let us to Priam's hall

I am giddy expectation whirls me round
like vassalage at unawares encountering

well uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to you
too headstrong for their mother See we fools



when waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy
bed chamber Pandar to provide this gear
what wouldst thou of us Trojan make demand
withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
a form of strangeness as we pass along

to send their smiles before them to Achilles
save these men's looks who do methinks find out
this is not strange Ulysses
the voice again or like a gate of steel
and great Troy shrinking
like to an enter'd tide they all rush by
more laud than gilt o'er-dusted

'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win





you told how Diomed a whole week by days

let's have your company or if you please
even in the soul of sound good-fellowship
she's bitter to her country Hear me Paris
trouble him not
with wings more momentary-swift than thought





do do
I know what tis to love
O Troilus Troilus

did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves

as infinite as imminent but I'll be true



she is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises

thou dreadful Ajax that the appalled air
in aspiration lifts him from the earth
I had good argument for kissing once
both take and give
may I sweet lady beg a kiss of you
fie fie upon her
shall to the edge of all extremity
valour and pride excel themselves in Hector
they are oppos'd already
did in great Ilion thus translate him to me
why then will I no more


and formless ruin of oblivion
she's well but bade me not commend her to you
and once fought with him he was a soldier good
I wonder now how yonder city stands


I tell thee yea
we have had pelting wars since you refus'd
at Menelaus' tent most princely Troilus



there where we see the lights
sweet draught sweet quoth a' sweet sink sweet sewer


and let your mind be coupled with your words
what did you swear you would bestow on me

nay but you part in anger

fear me not sweet lord
it is no matter now I have't again

to-morrow will I wear it on my helm
what shall I come the hour
all's done my lord

if beauty have a soul this is not she
the fractions of her faith orts of her love
falling on Diomed
I'll bring you to the gates
where is my brother Hector
O be persuaded do not count it holy
I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry

but by my ruin
ay but thou shalt not go
look how thou diest look how thy eye turns pale

but edifies another with her deeds

epistrophus and Cedius Polixenes is slain
that proof is called impossibility






along the field I will the Trojan trail

but dare all imminence that gods and men
but hear you hear you
some two months hence my will shall here be made
of what validity and pitch soe'er
so please my lord I might not be admitted

where like Arion on the dolphin's back
Orsino I have heard my father name him
till I had made mine own occasion mellow
what else may hap to time I will commit


my name is Mary sir
wherefore sweetheart what's your metaphor
I'll ride home to-morrow Sir Toby
I'll stay a month longer I am a fellow o' the strangest mind i' the world I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether
Taurus that's sides and heart
to thee the book even of my secret soul

whoe'er I woo myself would be his wife

do you not hear fellows Take away the lady
good madonna why mournest thou
O you are sick of self-love Malvolio and taste with a distempered appetite To be generous guiltless and of free disposition is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets There is no slander in an allowed fool though he do nothing but rail nor no railing in a known discreet man though he do nothing but reprove
thou hast spoken for us madonna as if thy eldest son should be a fool whose skull Jove cram with brains for here comes one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater

what manner of man




with groans that thunder love with sighs of fire
and sing them loud even in the dead of night
love make his heart of flint that you shall love
run after that same peevish messenger
let me yet know of you whither you are bound
but come what may I do adore thee so
she loves me sure the cunning of her passion


journeys end in lovers meeting




marry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritan
my purpose is indeed a horse of that colour

who was it


ay prithee sing
to weep there
tell her my love more noble than the world
so big to hold so much they lack retention


for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling
there is example for't the lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe
O peace peace peace now now
nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot
to the unknown beloved this and my good wishes her very phrases By your leave wax Soft and the impressure her Lucrece with which she uses to seal tis my lady To whom should this be





I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing




dear lady
that very oft we pity enemies
that you do think you are not what you are
for that I woo thou therefore hast no cause


and his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty
and not all love to see you though so much
I pray you let us satisfy our eyes



how do you Malvolio
heaven restore thee



why we shall make him mad indeed




pray you sir do you know of this matter
marry I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you
have done offence I take the fault on me

but be of comfort

but O how vile an idol proves this god
he nam'd Sebastian I my brother know

these wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years' purchase
let go thy hand

O say so and so be



good fool as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand help me to a candle and pen ink and paper As I am a gentleman I will live to be thankful to thee for't
fool fool fool I say
and anon sir
that this may be some error but no madness
may live at peace He shall conceal it
this is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again

here comes the man sir that did rescue me
he did me kindness sir drew on my side
did I expose myself pure for his love
here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth

but this your minion whom I know you love


and all the ceremony of this compact
what's the matter
how now gentleman how is't with you
I do perceive it hath offended you


all the occurrence of my fortune since
that severs day from night
open it and read it
ay madam

why you have given me such clear lights of favour
of thine own cause


a great while ago the world begun
richly in two short hours Only they


equal in lustre were now best now worst

surely sir
upon this French going-out took he upon him
grievingly I think
a proper title of a peace and purchas'd
that I advise your shunning
what are you chaf'd
and from a mouth of honour quite cry down
from sincere motions by intelligence

ere it was ask'd but when the way was made
my Lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earl
nay he must bear you company
O Nicholas Hopkins
nay we must longer kneel I am a suitor
my good Lord Cardinal they vent reproaches
you that are blam'd for it alike with us
the nature of it In what kind let's know

we should take root here where we sit or sit
let there be letters writ to every shire
almost with ravish'd listening could not find
I've heard him utter to his son-in-law

John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour

after your highness had reprov'd the duke
God mend all
is't possible the spells of France should juggle
that sure they've worn out Christendom
they must either
ay marry

sweet ladies will it please you sit Sir Harry
well said my lord
I am beholding to you cheer your neighbours
what's that
into our presence where this heaven of beauty
a thousand thanks and pray em take their pleasures
what say they
prithee come hither What fair lady's that
there's fresher air my lord

came to the bar where to his accusations
he spoke and learnedly for life but all

the mirror of all courtesy
for then my guiltless blood must cry against em
shall mark my grave Commend me to his Grace
let it alone my state now will but mock me
yet thus far we are one in fortunes both

how holily he works in all his business
the king's eyes that so long have slept upon

your Grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves
give me your hand much joy and favour to you

there ye shall meet about this weighty business
melt and lament for her


would for Carnarvonshire although there long'd
ta'en of your many virtues the king's majesty

before you open it
good lady
be't so Proceed
that thus you should proceed to put me off
against your sacred person in God's name
of singular integrity and learning
we are a queen or long have dream'd so certain
have stood to charity and display'd the effects

the queen is obstinate
that man i' the world who shall report he has

I know my life so even If your business
we come not by the way of accusation
but how to make ye suddenly an answer
and live a subject Nay forsooth my friends
is this your Christian counsel out upon ye
ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye

what will become of me now wretched lady
the hearts of princes kiss obedience
he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
have uncontemn'd gone by him or at least
I should be glad to hear such news as this
my king is tangled in affection to
now all my joy

his second marriage shall be publish'd and
the packet Cromwell
it shall be to the Duchess of Alen on

possession of a subject
you were now running o'er you have scarce time
'Tis well said again
my sovereign I confess your royal graces
that as my hand has open'd bounty to you
take notice lords he has a loyal breast
I sent the king Is there no way to cure this
stay
during my life and to confirm his goodness
far from his succour from the king from all
my sword i' the life-blood of thee else My lords
produce the grand sum of his sins the articles

Item you sent a large commission
so little of his great self
so farewell to the little good you bear me

I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders

bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee

he will deserve more

to whom he gave these words O father abbot

lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not
but such an honest chronicler as Griffith
it is not you I call for
how much her Grace is alter'd on the sudden
a gentleman sent from the king to see you
who grieves much for your weakness and by me
sir I most humbly pray you to deliver
a right good husband let him be a noble
out of this world tell him in death I bless'd him

I will have more or else unsay't and now


we shall hear more anon
and has done half-an-hour to know your pleasures
which reformation must be sudden too
a man that more detests more stirs against
you shall know many dare accuse you boldly
my Lord of Winchester you are a little
men's prayers then would seek you not their fears
we are
to a most noble judge the king my master
against this man whose honesty the devil
but whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for I'm sure
power as he was a counsellor to try him
be friends for shame my lords My Lord of Canterbury
the common voice I see is verified
on May-day morning which will never be
do you hear Master porter
great store of room no doubt left for the ladies


a pattern to all princes living with her
as great in admiration as herself
would I had known no more but she must die

and breathe short-winded accents of new broils
whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb
and a thousand of his people butchered
and pride of their contention did take horse

this is his uncle's teaching this is Worcester




Hal wilt thou make one
farewell thou latter spring Farewell All-hallown summer

my reformation glittering o'er my fault
have holp to make so portly
is guilty of this fault and not my son
he question'd me among the rest demanded
and I beseech you let not his report
hath lately married Shall our coffers then
who then affrighted with their bloody looks
we license your departure with your son
as this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke
to be depos'd and shortly murdered
O pardon me that I descend so low
therefore I say
to pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon
I'll keep them by this hand
and that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales
'Sblood
and make the Douglas' son your only mean

and see already how he doth begin

godsbody the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved What ostler A plague on thee hast thou never an eye in thy head canst not hear An twere not as good a deed as drink to break the pate on thee I am a very villain Come and be hanged hast no faith in thee
what ho chamberlain



some eight or ten



to thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy
what ho

an if thou wilt not tell me all things true
whither I must I must and to conclude




as merry as crickets my lad But hark ye what cunning match have you made with this jest of the drawer come what's the issue




so two more already
what upon compulsion Zounds an I were at the strappado or all the racks in the world I would not tell you on compulsion Give you a reason on compulsion If reasons were as plenty as blackberries I would give no man a reason upon compulsion I

now sirs by'r lady you fought fair so did you Peto so did you Bardolph you are lions too you ran away upon instinct you will not touch the true prince no fie
choler my lord if rightly taken
why what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for running
thy state is taken for a joint-stool thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown




for anything he shall be charg'd withal

and uncle Worcester a plague upon it
I say the earth did shake when I was born
I do not bear these crossings Give me leave
I can call spirits from the vasty deep
bootless home and weather-beaten back
and my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
a huge half-moon a monstrous cantle out


break with your wives of your departure hence
worse than a smoky house I had rather live
to put him quite beside his patience
she'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars
with ravishing division to her lute


not yours in good sooth Heart you swear like a comfit-maker's wife Not you in good sooth and as true as I live and as God shall mend me and as sure as day


the hope and expectation of thy time
my presence like a robe pontifical
heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
for all the world
this infant warrior in his enterprises
I will redeem all this on Percy's head
or I will tear the reckoning from his heart
as ever offer'd foul play in a state

I was never called so in my own house before

wilt thou believe me Hal three or four bonds of forty pound a-piece and a seal-ring of my grandfather's
say what beast thou knave thou
did I Bardolph
hostess I forgive thee Go make ready breakfast love thy husband look to thy servants cherish thy guests thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason thou seest I am pacified Still Nay prithee be gone
my lord
as not a soldier of this season's stamp


seems more than we shall find it Were it good
the quality and hair of our attempt
than if the earl were here for men must think
or hitherwards intended speedily
to turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
he cannot draw his power these fourteen days
Bardolph get thee before to Coventry fill me a bottle of sack our soldiers shall march through we'll to Sutton-Co'fil' to-night
faith Sir John tis more than time that I were there and you too but my powers are there already The king I can tell you looks for us all we must away all night
he is Sir John I fear we shall stay too long

to-night say I
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
you shall have your desires with interest
the more and less came in with cap and knee
when he was personal in the Irish war
too indirect for long continuance
to whom they are directed If you knew

and to prevent the worse Sir Michael speed
how now my Lord of Worcester tis not well

that you did nothing purpose gainst the state
that even our love durst not come near your sight
of pell-mell havoc and confusion



all his offences live upon my head
marry and shall and very willingly
and nephew challeng'd you to single fight
of teaching and of learning instantly
I cannot read them now
sound all the lofty instruments of war
I was not born a yielder thou proud Scot

he is indeed and living to kill thee
not I my lord unless I did bleed too
by God thou hast deceiv'd me Lancaster
seek Percy and thyself about the field
stay and breathe awhile


if thou wert sensible of courtesy
embowelled if thou embowel me to-day I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too to-morrow Sblood twas time to counterfeit or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too Counterfeit I lie I am no counterfeit to die is to be a counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed The better part of valour is discretion in the which better part I have saved my life Zounds I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy though he be dead how if he should counterfeit too and rise By my faith I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit Therefore I'll make him sure yea and I'll swear I killed him Why may not he rise as well as I Nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me therefore sirrah [stabbing him] with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me

and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary
upon the foot of fear fled with the rest
you son John and my cousin Westmoreland
that have consented unto Henry's death
what shall we curse the planets of mishap
more than God or religious churchmen may

and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought

my gracious lords to add to your laments
where valiant Talbot above human thought

so you had need for Orleans is besieg'd
being ordain'd his special governor
they want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves
Salisbury is a desperate homicide
their arms are set like clocks still to strike on
what's past and what's to come she can descry
she takes upon her bravely at first dash
and thou shalt find that I exceed my sex
stay stay thy hands thou art an Amazon

since I have entered into these wars

we do not otherwise than we are will'd

to slay thy brother Abel if thou wilt
now beat them hence why do you let them stay

abominable Gloucester guard thy head
wont through a secret gate of iron bars
discourse I prithee on this turret's top
the scarecrow that affrights our children so
and view the Frenchmen how they fortify
how far'st thou mirror of all martial men
remember to avenge me on the French
and make a quagmire of your mingled brains
my breast I'll burst with straining of my courage
they call'd us for our fierceness English dogs
rescu'd is Orleans from the English
for which I will divide my crown with her
sergeant you shall
traitors have never other company
the other yet may rise against their force

at all times will you have my power alike
I was employ'd in passing to and fro


here is the Talbot who would speak with him

the plot is laid if all things fall out right
I see report is fabulous and false

to think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow

the mind of Talbot as you did mistake

and on my side it is so well apparell'd
and say withal I think he held the right
if I my lord for my opinion bleed
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
proud Pole I will and scorn both him and thee
corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
until it wither with me to my grave
and here I prophesy this brawl to-day
so fare my limbs with long imprisonment
poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
that cause fair nephew that imprison'd me
I was the next by birth and parentage

might but redeem the passage of your age
and for those wrongs those bitter injuries
that therefore I have forg'd or am not able
or how haps it I seek not to advance
and am not I a prelate of the church

believe me lords my tender years can tell

and have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes
you see what mischief and what murder too
but prove a chief offender in the same
but join in friendship as your lords have done
therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
and rise created princely Duke of York

take heed be wary how you place your words
now Roan I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground
the burning torch in yonder turret stands

if Talbot do but thunder rain will follow
for Talbot means no-goodness by his looks
we will bestow you in some better place



and of thy cunning had no diffidence
for ever should they be expuls'd from France

O turn thy edged sword another way
and was he not in England prisoner

and with submissive loyalty of heart
and in our coronation take your place
that whoso draws a sword tis present death
this shall ye do so help you righteous God
myself and divers gentlemen beside
be quite degraded like a hedge-born swain
and join'd with Charles the rightful King of France
then gather strength and march unto him straight

for though he seem with forged quaint conceit


let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
after some respite will return to Calais
I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
be humble to us call my sov'reign yours
to wall thee from the liberty of flight


spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot
and on his son young John whom two hours since
Henry the Fifth Whiles they each other cross
whither my lord from bought and sold Lord Talbot
swearing that you withhold his levied host

the world will say he is not Talbot's blood
here on my knee I beg mortality

and left us to the rage of France his sword
bespoke him thus Contaminated base
all these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away


how the young whelp of Talbot's raging-wood

lord Strange of Blackmere Lord Vordun of Alton
were but his picture left among you here
have you perus'd the letters from the pope
and surer bind this knot of amity


and turn again unto the war-like French



a plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee

confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough



what

to give thee answer of thy just demand
that is her ransom I deliver her
the Christian prince King Henry were he here

Ah Joan this kills thy father's heart outright
fie Joan that thou wilt be so obstacle

whose maiden blood thus rigorously effus'd
is all your strict preciseness come to this
why here's a girl I think she knows not well

the utter loss of all the realm of France
and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
that which I have than coveting for more
by our proceeding in hostility
your wondrous rare description noble earl
command I mean of virtuous chaste intents
why what I pray is Margaret more than that
and not to seek a queen to make him rich
will answer our hope in issue of a king
king Henry's faithful and anointed queen
Margaret shall now be queen and rule the king
desiring thee to lay aside the sword
so hence Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
which none but heaven and you and I shall hear
what art thou
heaven guard my mother's honour and my land
the accent of his tongue affecteth him
to treat of high affairs touching that time
that marry wives Tell me how if my brother
lord of thy presence and no land beside
madam I'll follow you unto the death
the very spirit of Plantagenet
but many a many foot of land the worse
the Pyrenean and the river Po


some proper man I hope who was it mother
the aweless lion could not wage the fight
to spread his colours boy in thy behalf
and coops from other lands her islanders
wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood
whose leisure I have stay'd have given him time
cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
with burden of our armour here we sweat
to draw my answer from thy articles
my bed was ever to thy son as true
an a' may catch your hide and you alone
England and Ireland Anjou Touraine Maine

removed from thy sin-conceiving womb
it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
have hither march'd to your endamagement
they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
to him that owes it namely this young prince
in brief we are the King of England's subjects

and make a monster of you
whose sons he scatter'd on the bleeding ground
our lusty English all with purpled hands
unless thou let his silver water keep
cry havoc kings back to the stained field
kings of ourselves until our fears resolv'd
turn face to face and bloody point to point

persever not but hear me mighty kings
and she a fair divided excellence
out of his rags Here's a large mouth indeed
are capable of this ambition
as she in beauty education blood
in such a love so vile a lout as he

is not the Lady Constance in this troop
if not fill up the measure of her will
commodity the bias of the world
and say there is no sin but to be rich
a woman naturally born to fears
which in the very meeting fall and die
for then I should not love thee no nor thou

what hath this day deserv'd what hath it done
you came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood
but when her humorous ladyship is by
we like not this thou dost forget thyself
so slight unworthy and ridiculous
though you and all the rest so grossly led
there's law and warrant lady for my curse

in likeness of a new untrimmed bride
I am perplex'd and know not what to say
and shall these hands so lately purg'd of blood
France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
yet indirection thereby grows direct
so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off


lady with me with me thy fortune lies
and pours down mischief Austria's head lie there


I had a thing to say but let it go
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts

so by a roaring tempest on the flood

and ring these fingers with thy household worms
my name is Constance I was Geffrey's wife
do glue themselves in sociable grief
there was not such a gracious creature born
stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
before the curing of a strong disease
shall blow each dust each straw each little rub

O sir when he shall hear of your approach


if I talk to him with his innocent prate

and call it cunning do an if you will

go stand within let me alone with him
your vile intent must needs seem horrible
and strew'd repentant ashes on his head
you were disguised
and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off
of plain old form is much disfigured

your tender kinsman and to choke his days
and I do fearfully believe tis done
this must be answer'd either here or hence
there is no sure foundation set on blood
and she not hear of it

not knowing what they fear but full of fear

and fly like thought from them to me again
five moons

witness against us to damnation
and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
the dreadful motion of a murderous thought
there's few or none do know me if they did
to-morrow morning let us meet him then
therefore twere reason you had manners now
or have you read or heard or could you think

lords I am hot with haste in seeking you

or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
away with me all you whose souls abhor
as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child

a thousand businesses are brief in hand
that present medicine must be minister'd
all Kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
let not the world see fear and sad distrust
led by the Dauphin

cries out upon the name of Salisbury
and not to spend it so unneighbourly
nor met with fortune other than at feasts
therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up
his peace with Rome What is that peace to me
outside or inside I will not return
he flatly says he'll not lay down his arms
thinking this voice an armed Englishman
give me leave to speak
to feast upon whole thousands of the French


upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury
even this ill night your breathing shall expire
stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd


thou mayst befriend me so much as to think

withhold thine indignation mighty heaven
of that fell poison which assaileth him
his soul and body to their lasting rest
nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
the tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd
what surety of the world what hope what stay
with purpose presently to leave this war
thither shall it then
and we shall shock them Nought shall make us rue
that did affright the air at Agincourt
gently to hear kindly to judge our play
of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
and whipp'd the offending Adam out of him
the Gordian knot of it he will unloose
grew like the summer grass fastest by night
than ever at one time the clergy yet


for never two such kingdoms did contend
yet their own authors faithfully affirm
beyond the river Sala in the year
daughter to Charles the aforesaid Duke of Loraine
stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
is in the very May-morn of his youth
we must not only arm to invade the French
hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood
to her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
obedience for so work the honey-bees
as many arrows loosed several ways
or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit


be like a king and show my sail of greatness
so get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin

but see thy fault France hath in thee found out
we'll not offend one stomach with our play

solus egregious dog O viper vile
thy spirits are most tall
by my troth he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days The king has killed his heart Good husband come home presently
corporal Nym an thou wilt be friends be friends an thou wilt not why then be enemies with me too Prithee put up
as ever you came of women come in quickly to Sir John Ah poor heart he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold Sweet men come to him
the king hath note of all that they intend
we carry not a heart with us from hence
and labour shall refresh itself with hope

there yours Lord Scroop of Masham and sir knight
you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
could out of thee extract one spark of evil
if that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
for this revolt of thine methinks is like

the taste whereof God of his mercy give you
no for my manly heart doth yearn

to suck to suck the very blood to suck
and you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch
no with no more than if we heard that England
well tis not so my lord high constable
saw his heroical seed and smil'd to see him
self-love my liege is not so vile a sin
in every branch truly demonstrative
the dead men's blood the pining maidens' groans
he'll call you to so hot an answer of it
to-morrow shall you know our mind at full
borne with the invisible and creeping wind
some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean
cry God for Harry England and Saint George
my purpose should not fail with me
captain Fluellen you must come presently to the mines the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you
god-den to your worship good Captain James
look you if you take the matter otherwise than is meant Captain Macmorris peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me look you being as good a man as yourself both in the disciplines of wars and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
take pity of your town and of your people
to raise so great a siege Therefore great king



de foot et de coun O Seigneur Dieu ces sont mots de son mauvais corruptible gros et impudique et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user Je ne voudrois prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde Foh le foot et le coun N antmoins je reciterai une autre fois ma le on ensemble de hand de fingre de nails d'arm d'elbow de nick de sin de foot de coun
mort de ma vie if they march along
our mettle is bred out and they will give
for your great seats now quit you of great shames
prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Roan

for he hath stol'n a pax and hanged must a' be


what is thy name I know thy quality
my army but a weak and sickly guard
beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves
and of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts
so perhaps did yours
my lord constable the armour that I saw in your tent to-night are those stars or suns upon it
'Tis midnight I'll go arm myself


that they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy head-pieces
the hum of either army stilly sounds
the morning's danger and their gesture sad
thawing cold fear Then mean and gentle all
thus may we gather honey from the weed
do my good morrow to them and anon

I love the lovely bully What's thy name

I pray you and peseech you that you will




creating awe and fear in other men
not all these laid in bed majestical
my lord your nobles jealous of your absence
who twice a day their wither'd hands hold up
O brave spirit
the English are embattail'd you French peers
a very little little let us do
and their executors the knavish crows
the king himself is rode to view their battle
he is as full of valour as of kindness
no faith my coz wish not a man from England
but he'll remember with advantages
my sov'reign lord bestow yourself with speed
before thy most assured overthrow
shall witness live in brass of this day's work
they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
take it brave York Now soldiers march away


what are his words

let's die in honour once more back again

upon these words I came and cheer'd him up
then every soldier kill his prisoners
it is not well done mark you now to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it as Alexander killed his friend Cleitus being in his ales and his cups so also Harry Monmouth being in his right wits and his good judgments turned away the fat knight with the great belly-doublet he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries and mocks I have forgot his name

killing them twice O give us leave great king

soldier why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap
who servest thou under

I warrant it is to knight you captain
I am no traitor
and thou hast given me most bitter terms
I will none of your money
one hundred twenty-six added to these


athwart the sea Behold the English beach
as by a lower but loving likelihood
there is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things I will tell you asse my friend Captain Gower The rascally scald beggarly lousy pragging knave Pistol which you and yourself and all the orld know to be no petter than a fellow look you now of no merits he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday look you and pid me eat my leek It was in a place where I could not preed no contention with him but I will be so pold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires
you say very true scald knave when

news have I that my Nell is dead i' the spital
most worthy brother England fairly met
to bring your most imperial majesties
doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
should not expel these inconveniences
to re-survey them we will suddenly







issue to me that the contending kingdoms
thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
and of it left his son imperial lord
under the smile of safety wounds the world
under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword
that the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here

here comes my servant Travers whom I sent
and bending forward struck his armed heels
he was some hilding fellow that had stolen
drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night
and I will take it as a sweet disgrace
I am sorry I should force you to believe
fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester
weaken'd with grief being now enrag'd with grief
sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
we all that are engaged to this loss
this word rebellion it had froze them up
sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water






seven groats and twopence
and our supplies live largely in the hope

then must we rate the cost of the erection
grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
if he should do so
and being now trimm'd in thine own desires
master Fang have you entered the exion
if I can close with him I care not for his thrust




at Basingstoke my lord



and yours most noble Bardolph



and for mine sir I will govern it
I have given over I will speak no more
he had no legs that practis'd not his gait
had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers
and never shall have length of life enough
sirrah here will be the prince and Master Poins anon and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons and Sir John must not know of it Bardolph hath brought word

sir Ancient Pistol's below and would speak with you

away you cut-purse rascal you filthy bung away By this wine I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me Away you bottle-ale rascal you basket-hilt stale juggler you Since when I pray you sir God's light with two points on your shoulder much
good Captain Peesel be quiet it is very late i' faith I beseek you now aggravate your choler
si fortuna me tormente sperato me contento
then death rock me asleep abridge my doleful days







and asking every one for Sir John Falstaff

how many thousand of my poorest subjects
with deaf'ning clamour in the slippery clouds

what perils past what crosses to ensue
but that necessity so bow'd the state
unless on you
I will take your counsel



here an't please you
peace fellow peace stand aside know you where you are For the other Sir John let me see Simon Shadow
where's he
a woman's tailor sir



well said thou'rt a good fellow


he is retir'd to ripe his growing fortunes
what well-appointed leader fronts us here
of base and bloody insurrection
but my most noble Lord of Westmoreland
even by those men that most have done us wrong


the Earl of Hereford was reputed then
Mowbray you overween to take it so



besides the king hath wasted all his rods

to us the speaker in his parliament
the parcels and particulars of our grief

and thereupon I drink unto your Grace
for I am on the sudden something ill


whereof you did complain which by mine honour
as good a man as he sir whoe'er I am Do ye yield sir or shall I sweat for you If I do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy


my lord I beseech you give me leave to go
and draw no swords but what are sanctified
is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him
yet notwithstanding being incens'd he's flint


added to that that I am to deliver
with a great power of English and of Scots
my sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up


let us withdraw into the other room
this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep

is he so hasty that he doth suppose
yield his engrossments to the ending father
I never thought to hear you speak again
then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
for the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
God witness with me when I here came in
but if it did infect my blood with joy
better opinion better confirmation
to be again displac'd which to avoid
look look here comes my John of Lancaster
I should not die but in Jerusalem
yes sir Here is now the smith's note for shoeing and plough-irons
I grant your worship that he is a knave sir but yet God forbid sir but a knave should have some countenance at his friend's request An honest man sir is able to speak for himself when a knave is not I have served your worship truly sir this eight years and if I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man I have but a very little credit with your worship The knave is mine honest friend sir therefore I beseech your worship let him be countenanced

which cannot look more hideously upon me
we do remember but our argument
and never shall you see that I will beg
and wear it in my heart Why then be sad
no
to pluck down justice from your awful bench
till you do live to see a son of mine
and with his spirit sadly I survive
God shorten Harry's happy life one day
and ever among so merrily
I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle
and we shall be merry now comes in the sweet o' the night

is't so Why then say an old man can do somewhat
sir John I am thy Pistol and thy friend




come here Pistol stand behind me O if I had had time to have made new liveries I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you But tis no matter this poor show doth better this doth infer the zeal I had to see him

the heavens thee guard and keep most royal imp of fame
for God doth know so shall the world perceive
ay marry Sir John which I beseech you to let me have home with me

come will you hence
in sight of England and her lordly peers
makes me the bolder to salute my king

my Lord of Winchester I know your mind

and greatness of his place be grief to us
Warwick my son the comfort of my age

still revelling like lords till all be gone
nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right
why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows
my troublous dream this night doth make me sad
where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me


we'll see these things effected to the full
Hume if you take not heed you shall go near

and as for you that love to be protected
I thought King Henry had resembled thee
but can do more in England than the king
madam myself have lim'd a bush for her
if Somerset be unworthy of the place
to give his censure these are no women's matters

she'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby




I have heard her reported to be a woman of invincible spirit but it shall be convenient Master Hume that you be by her aloft while we be busy below and so I pray you go in God's name and leave us
asmath
safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
and kept asunder You madam shall with us
safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
I saw not better sport these seven years' day
were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven
an't like your lordly lord-protectorship
ay where thou dar'st not peep an if thou dar'st


that we for thee may glorify the Lord

a plum-tree master




you made in a day my lord whole towns to fly
this news I think hath turn'd your weapon's edge
as like to pitch defile nobility

sent his poor queen to France from whence she came
as I have read laid claim unto the crown
it fails not yet but flourishes in thee
'Tis that they seek and they in seeking that
and you three shall be strangled on the gallows
protector be and God shall be my hope
and Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself

come leave your drinking and fall to blows Sirrah what's thy name
God and the good wine in thy master's way
ten is the hour that was appointed me
and nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
no dark shall be my light and night my day
I must offend before I be attainted

for none abides with me my joy is death

how insolent of late he is become
or be admitted to your highness' council
upon my life began her devilish practices

hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
all happiness unto my lord the king
nor ever had one penny bribe from France
pity was all the fault that was in me
Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
causeless have laid disgraces on my head
as if she had suborned some to swear

and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
with shining checker'd slough doth sting a child

be it by gins by snares by subtilty
here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
witness the fortune he hath had in France

but now return we to the false Duke Humphrey
faster than spring-time showers comes thought on thought
John Cade of Ashford
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
ay my good lord he's dead
proceed no straiter gainst our uncle Gloucester
the duke was dumb and could not speak a word
and thinks he that the chirping of a wren
or blood-consuming sighs recall his life
why then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy
because thy flinty heart more hard than they
am I not witch'd like her or thou not false like him

for with his soul fled all my worldly solace
but see his face is black and full of blood

that I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death
but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
and torture him with grievous lingering death
with whose envenomed and fatal sting
for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
come Warwick come good Warwick go with me
deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth
and turn the force of them upon thyself
I will repeal thee or be well assur'd

why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee
O let me stay befall what may befall
how fares my lord speak Beaufort to thy sovereign
give me some drink and bid the apothecary
forbear to judge for we are sinners all

and therefore to revenge it shalt thou die
therefore when merchant-like I sell revenge
and thought thee happy when I shook my head
thou dar'st not for thy own
and like ambitious Sylla overgorg'd

what are ye daunted now now will ye stoop
a Roman sworder and banditto slave
come and get thee a sword though made of a lath they have been up these two days
he shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's-leather of



emmanuel
no
villain thy father was a plasterer
became a bricklayer when he came to age
O gross and miserable ignorance
spare none but such as go in clouted shoon

but stay I'll read it over once again


my hope is gone now Suffolk is deceas'd
and so farewell for I must hence again
I have a suit unto your lordship
well he shall be beheaded for it ten times Ah thou say thou serge nay thou buckram lord now art thou within pointblank of our jurisdiction regal What canst thou answer to my majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Monsieur Basimecu the Dauphin of France Be it known unto thee by these presence even the presence of Lord Mortimer that I am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar-school and whereas before our fore-fathers had no other books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to be used and contrary to the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a paper-mill It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no Christian car can endure to hear Thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer Moreover thou hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou hast hanged them when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live Thou dost ride on a foot-cloth dost thou not
the people liberal valiant active wealthy
those that I never saw and struck them dead
have I affected wealth or honour speak

what say ye countrymen will ye relent
nor knows he how to live but by the spoil
what is he fled go some and follow him

the Duke of York is newly come from Ireland
I'll yield myself to prison willingly
or gather wealth I care not with what envy
set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser
Iden farewell and be proud of thy victory Tell Kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be cowards for I that never feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour
this hand was made to handle nought but gold
shouldst raise so great a power without his leave


lo I present your Grace a traitor's head
rise up a knight
king did I call thee no thou art not king
sirrah call in my sons to be my bail



O where is faith O where is loyalty

you were best to go to bed and dream again
to quell the rebels and their complices
the deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed

whom angry heavens do make their minister
no more will I their babes tears virginal
sword hold thy temper heart be wrathful still
but that my heart's on future mischief set
persuaded him from any further act
let us pursue him ere the writs go forth
charg'd our main battle's front and breaking in

unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
I'll plant Plantagenet root him up who dares

I am thy sovereign

as shall revenge his death before I stir
father tear the crown from the usurper's head
ay and their colours often borne in France
resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth
all will revolt from me and turn to him
what mutter you or what conspire you lords



and I with grief and sorrow to the court
or felt that pain which I did for him once
Warwick is chancellor and the Lord of Calais
stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak
the loss of those three lords torments my heart


brother thou shalt to London presently
ay with my sword What think'st thou that we fear them
a woman's general what should we fear

be thou reveng'd on men and let me live
O let me pray before I take my death

and full as oft came Edward to my side
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage
breathe out invectives gainst the officers
when he might spurn him with his foot away
was't you that revell'd in our parliament
stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance
that is my office for my father's sake
that beggars mounted run their horse to death
these tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies
there take the crown and with the crown my curse
open thy gate of mercy gracious God
methought he bore him in the thickest troop
now are they but one lamp one light one sun
Ah one that was a woeful looker-on
a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart

and very well appointed as I thought
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause
but ne'er till now his scandal of retire
and therefore comes my brother Montague
ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine
withhold revenge dear God tis not my fault
unreasonable creatures feed their young
but Clifford tell me didst thou never hear

why that's my fortune too therefore I'll stay
you that are king though he do wear the crown
why how now long-tongu'd Warwick dare you speak
as thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland





till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine
away away Once more sweet lords farewell
and here's the heart that triumphs in their death
both tugging to be victors breast to breast
so many hours must I tend my flock
is far beyond a prince's delicates
pardon me God I knew not what I did
blown with the windy tempest of my heart
take on with me and ne'er be satisfied
for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go
with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
the common people swarm like summer flies
and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
a deadly groan like life and death's departing
and his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak

ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head
and George of Clarence Warwick as ourself
and for the time shall not seem tedious
let me embrace thee sour adversity
to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears


and yielding to another when it blows

silence




to tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee

and that is more than I will yield unto

and brought as prisoner to your palace gate
and spies a far-off shore where he would tread
to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub
seeking a way and straying from the way

and sit thee by our side
and if thou fail us all our hope is done

I am commanded with your leave and favour
injurious Margaret
of threescore and two years a silly time

unto our sister Bona
then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edward's

these from our king unto your majesty
sends me a paper to persuade me patience
I here renounce him and return to Henry

to revel it with him and his new bride
what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance
how could he stay till Warwick made return
yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
is now dishonoured by this new marriage
for this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
which being shallow you shall give me leave
nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
'Go tell false Edward thy supposed king


but if you mind to hold your true obedience

that as Ulysses and stout Diomede
never to lie and take his natural rest
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him

though Fortune's malice overthrow my state
but march to London with our soldiers
or by his foe surpris'd at unawares

comes hunting this way to disport himself

at our enlargement what are thy due fees
Warwick although my head still wear the crown
now join your hands and with your hands your hearts


and the Lord Hastings who attended him

are well foretold that danger lurks within

what fear not man but yield me up the keys
drummer strike up and let us march away
brother we will proclaim you out of hand


fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship

where is the post that came from valiant Oxford
it is not his my lord here Southam lies

and Henry is my king Warwick his subject



I am so sorry for my trespass made
or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
that I must yield my body to the earth

that mought not be distinguish'd but at last

great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss
we will not from the helm to sit and weep
should if a coward heard her speak these words

which by the heavens' assistance and your strength
for Somerset off with his guilty head
for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects



as deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince

'Tis sin to flatter good' was little better


not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
down down to hell and say I sent thee thither
for I will buzz abroad such prophecies
and made the forest tremble when they roar'd
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe
and now what rests but that we spend the time
on some known ground of treachery in him

once more the more to aggravate the note
which to maintain I would allow him odds
I'll answer thee in any fair degree
further I say and further will maintain
Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
neglected my sworn duty in that case
let's purge this choler without letting blood
the one my duty owes but my fair name
then dear my liege mine honour let me try
there shall your swords and lances arbitrate
were as seven vials of his sacred blood
teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
that it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast
with all good speed at Plashy visit me

to prove him in defending of myself
to God of heaven King Richard and to me
so be thy fortune in this royal fight
that it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat
more than my dancing soul doth celebrate
stands here for God his sovereign and himself
withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
you cousin Hereford upon pain of life
as to be cast forth in the common air



my inch of taper will be burnt and done
O had it been a stranger not my child
that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends
esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
devouring pestilence hangs in our air
than when it bites but lanceth not the sore
which then blew bitterly against our faces
observ'd his courtship to the common people
we will ourself in person to this war
at Ely House
for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
then all too late comes counsel to be heard
this precious stone set in the silver sea
hath made a shameful conquest of itself
and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
now he that made me knows I see thee ill
landlord of England art thou now not king
may be a precedent and witness good
as theirs so mine and all be as it is
and for these great affairs do ask some charge
but when he frown'd it was against the French
take Hereford's rights away and take from Time
but by bad courses may be understood
richly in both if justice had her right
by flatterers and what they will inform
the king's grown bankrupt like a broken man
how near the tidings of our comfort is
the first departing of the king for Ireland
to please the king I did to please myself
of what it is not Then thrice-gracious queen

the Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby
I will despair and be at enmity
now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made

well somewhat we must do Come cousin
wherein the king stands generally condemn'd
is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry
which I protest hath very much beguil'd


and in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour

here comes his Grace in person
why foolish boy the king is left behind
but as I come I come for Lancaster
and challenge law attorneys are denied me
but for his own and for the right of that
which I have sworn to weed and pluck away
and lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change
since presently your souls must part your bodies
dispark'd my parks and felled my forest woods
take special care my greetings be deliver'd
plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
hath power to keep you king in spite of all
stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
nor near nor further off my gracious lord

strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we
thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
would they make peace terrible hell make war
let's choose executors and talk of wills
were brass impregnable and humour'd thus
my father hath a power inquire of him

discharge my followers let them hence away
would you have been so brief with him he would
yes my good lord
if not I'll use the advantage of my power

that hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship
change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
O God O God that e'er this tongue of mine
my sceptre for a palmer's walking-staff
I talk but idly and you laugh at me
makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
so far be mine my most redoubted lord

it doth remember me the more of sorrow

swarming with caterpillars
they might have liv'd to bear and he to taste
dar'st thou thou little better thing than earth
thy sorrow in my breast Come ladies go

shall I so much dishonour my fair stars
if thou deny'st it twenty times thou liest
I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle
dishonourable boy
some honest Christian trust me with a gage

marry God forbid
my Lord of Hereford here whom you call king
to keep him safely till his day of trial
wherewith I reign'd I hardly yet have learn'd
here cousin
the cares I give I have though given away
make me that nothing have with nothing griev'd
there shouldst thou find one heinous article
made glory base and sovereignty a slave
go some of you and fetch a looking-glass
like to my followers in prosperity
'Tis very true my grief lies all within


to Julius C sar's ill-erected tower
to think our former state a happy dream
I had been still a happy king of men
with all swift speed you must away to France
doubly divorc'd Bad men ye violate

that I may strive to kill it with a groan
while all tongues cried God save thee Bolingbroke
no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home



I will appeach the villain
hence villain never more come in my sight
we'll keep him here then what is that to him
and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
my lord some two days since I saw the prince


remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd
and he shall spend mine honour with his shame

for ever will I walk upon my knees
ours of true zeal and deep integrity
speak pardon' as tis current in our land
I pardon him

my brain I'll prove the female to my soul
who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
and here have I the daintiness of ear
for tis a sign of love and love to Richard
that horse that I so carefully have dress'd
fellow give place here is no longer stay
how now what means death in this rude assault
kind uncle York the latest news we hear
that sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow
great king within this coffin I present
come mourn with me for that I do lament
he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
plots have I laid inductions dangerous
upon what cause

if we will keep in favour with the king

I will perform it to enfranchise you
good time of day unto my gracious lord
the king is sickly weak and melancholy
and leave the world for me to bustle in
to hear the lamentations of poor Anne
come now toward Chertsey with your holy load

thy deed inhuman and unnatural
vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
say that I slew them not
that never dreamt on aught but butcheries
some dungeon
your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep


these eyes which never shed remorseful tear
lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword


to him that hath most cause to be a mourner
sirs take up the corse
stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury
and then return lamenting to my love

and loves not me be you good lord assur'd
ay madam he desires to make atonement
by silken sly insinuating Jacks

against the Duke of Clarence but have been
a bachelor a handsome stripling too
'Tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
withal what I have been and what I am
we follow'd then our lord our lawful king
Ah gentle villain do not turn away
steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland
that Henry's death my lovely Edward's death
was stabb'd with bloody daggers God I pray him
the slave of nature and the son of hell


whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
nor thou within the compass of my curse
O but remember this another day
marry as for Clarence he is well repaid


go go dispatch
upon the hatches thence we look'd toward England
and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by
was my great father-in-law renowned Warwick
that now give evidence against my soul


so I am to let him live
'Tis no matter let it go there's few or none will entertain it
strike
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
are you call'd forth from out a world of men
spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's
he sends you not to murder me for this
and I will send you to my brother Gloucester


take that and that if all this will not do
and when I have my meed I will away
either of you to be the other's end
and so swear I
there wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
by any in this presence I desire
to take our brother Clarence to your grace
and that a winged Mercury did bear

but when your carters or your waiting-vassals
to comfort Edward with our company

Ah that deceit should steal such gentle shape
Edward my lord thy son our king is dead
Clarence and Edward O what cause have I

and I will pamper it with lamentation
madam my mother I do cry you mercy
must gently be preserv'd cherish'd and kept
yet since it is but green it should be put
my other self my counsel's consistory

for then this land was famously enrich'd
untimely storms make men expect a dearth
at Stony-Stratford they do rest to-night
good faith good faith the saying did not hold

how doth the prince
Ah me I see the ruin of my house
madam farewell
have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
I thank you good my lord and thank you all
unto his princely brother presently
and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
for your best health and recreation
what say you uncle

he hath my lord
a greater gift than that I'll give my cousin


was not incensed by his subtle mother

give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more


where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
and I believe will never stand upright
to bar my master's heirs in true descent
the princes both make high account of you
I would be so triumphant as I am
how now sirrah how goes the world with thee

come will you go
and for more slander to thy dismal seat
is to determine of the coronation
but for his purpose in the coronation
his lordship knows me well and loves me well
to-morrow in my judgment is too sudden


and I myself secure in grace and favour
they smile at me who shortly shall be dead
lord Mayor
so dear I lov'd the man that I must weep
what think you we are Turks or infidels
that you might well have signified the same
there at your meetest vantage of the time
because my lord you know my mother lives
now will I in to take some privy order

your discipline in war wisdom in peace
when he had done some followers of mine own
I go and if you plead as well for them
tell him myself the mayor and aldermen

see where his Grace stands tween two clergymen
I do suspect I have done some offence
and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
which fondly you would here impose on me
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit
even in the afternoon of her best days
O make them joyful grant their lawful suit


farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends
and in good time here the lieutenant comes
then bring me to their sights I'll bear thy blame
be of good cheer mother how fares your Grace
O ill-dispersing wind of misery
which issu'd from my other angel husband
poor heart adieu I pity thy complaining
pity you ancient stones those tender babes

what sayst thou now speak suddenly be brief
my lord

murder her brothers and then marry her
Tyrrell I mean those bastards in the Tower
Stanley he is your wife's son well look to it
have told me I being by that I should kill him

the tyrannous and bloody act is done
they could not speak and so I left them both

my lord
and drop into the rotten mouth of death
that my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute
as thou canst yield a melancholy seat
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
young York he is but boot because both they
I call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen
for one being fear'd of all now fearing one
and he that slew them fouler than he is


O let me speak
more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
I have no moe sons of the royal blood

till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart



mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne
to quicken your increase I will beget
again shall you be mother to a king

say I will love her everlastingly
then plainly to her tell my loving tale
thy George profan'd hath lost his holy honour
God's wrong is most of all
old barren plants to wail it with their age
be the attorney of my love to her
shall I go win my daughter to thy will

the greatest strength and power he can make
when thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way

pleaseth your majesty to give me leave
bishop of Exeter his brother there

march on march on since we are up in arms
the fear of that holds off my present aid
farewell
false to his children or his wife's allies
and here receive we from our father Stanley


give me some ink and paper in my tent
and give him from me this most needful note

saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow
Ratcliff about the mid of night come to my tent
and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms
that they may crush down with a heavy fall

Rivers that died at Pomfret despair and die
dream on thy cousins smother'd in the Tower
dream of success and happy victory
O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me
throng to the bar crying all Guilty guilty

how have you slept my lord
like high-rear'd bulwarks stand before our faces
your children's children quit it in your age
tell the clock there Give me a calendar
arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field
jockey of Norfolk be not too bold
and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
amaze the welkin with your broken staves
daring an opposite to every danger
lo here this long-usurped royalty
we will unite the white rose and the red
that would with treason wound this fair land's peace

take in that kingdom and enfranchise that
and such a twain can do t in which I bind
to make itself in thee fair and admir'd

pray then foresee me one
good now some excellent fortune Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage find me to marry me with Octavius C sar and companion me with my mistress
we'll know all our fortunes

no lady

extended Asia from Euphrates

forbear me


upon his son who high in name and power


so mightily betray'd yet at the first
art turn'd the greatest liar
by any desperate change My more particular
that quickens Nilus' slime I go from hence

holds idleness your subject I should take you
you may see Lepidus and henceforth know
to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
thy biddings have been done and every hour
with keels of every kind many hot inroads
which some did die to look on and all this


not in deed madam for I can do nothing
there would he anchor his aspect and die
to mend the petty present I will piece
so does it no man else Mett'st thou my posts
my man of men


I could have given less matter
to draw their swords but how the fear of us
for private stomaching
I do not know

no more than my residing here at Rome
as matter whole you n' have to make it with
made out of her impatience which not wanted
the article of your oath which you shall never
to have me out of Egypt made wars here
you wrong this presence therefore speak no more
if Cleopatra heard you your reproof
by duty ruminated



she's a most triumphant lady if report be square to her
to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool

now Antony must leave her utterly

thither

i' the east my pleasure lies
your way is shorter

that time O times

I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st
I do not like but yet it does allay


I will not hurt him
he's married madam
O that his fault should make a knave of thee


thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails

your mother came to Sicily and did find
to make my heart her vassal
you have heard much


and you by land
true sir she was the wife of Caius Marcellus
and thus it may be Come sir will you aboard I have a health for you



I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes
hast thou drunk well
I should have found it afterwards well done


the holding every man shall bear as loud
I'll try you on the shore
hoo noble captain come
better to leave undone than by our deed
that magical word of war we have effected
'Tis a noble Lepidus
think speak cast write sing number hoo
shall pass on thy approof Most noble Antony
the elements be kind to thee and make
will C sar weep
come sir come
go to go to



I will employ thee back again I find thee
where I will write All may be well enough
praying for both parts
your reconciler Wars twixt you twain would be
this is old what is the success
but let it be Bring me to Antony
his sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd we had not rated him

by sea and land supplying every stage

till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led

if we should serve with horse and mares together
here comes the emperor
for that he dares us to t
the absolute soldiership you have by land
C sar has taken Toryne
by Hercules I think I am i' the right
they say one Taurus
set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill

experience manhood honour ne'er before
to C sar will I render
I have myself resolv'd upon a course

that the mad Brutus ended he alone
sir the queen
now I must

to let him breathe between the heavens and earth
from thine invention offers Women are not

will yield us up

mine honesty and I begin to square


most kind messenger
what art thou fellow
whip him Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries

to let a fellow that will take rewards
to follow C sar in his triumph since

together with my brave Egyptians all
were nice and lucky men did ransom lives

make boot of his distraction never anger



you take me in too dolorous a sense

hark
how now masters




one ever near thee call for Enobarbus
to change a master O my fortunes have
plant those that have revolted in the van
unloading of his mules
my latter part of life

for doughty-handed are you and have fought
the world's great snare uncaught
to camp this host we all would sup together
what man is this
and finish all foul thoughts O Antony
awake sir awake speak to us
we'd fight there too But this it is our foot
and dare not speak their knowledge Antony
on blossoming C sar and this pine is bark'd
with her prepared nails
the soul and body rive not more in parting
they are black vesper's pageants
ourselves to end ourselves
between her heart and lips She render'd life

with ships made cities condemn myself to lack
to penetrative shame whilst the wheel'd seat
lo thee
of Antony's death
the star is fallen
where's Antony
lock'd in her monument She had a prophesying fear

how now is he dead
I am dying Egypt dying only
our strength is all gone into heaviness
of C sar seek your honour with your safety O
noblest of men woo t die

our lamp is spent it's out Good sirs take heart
he was my master and I wore my life
which writ his honour in the acts it did

but I will tell you at some meeter season
come hither Proculeius Go and say
let him alone for I remember now
and bids thee study on what fair demands
make your full reference freely to my lord
guard her till C sar come
his nobleness well acted which your death
blow me into abhorring rather make

if it might please ye
Cleopatra

I pray you rise rise Egypt
which towards you are most gentle you shall find
this is my treasurer let him speak my lord
than love that's hir'd What goest thou back thou shalt
beneath the fall I have
of things that merchants sold Therefore be cheer'd
I have spoke already and it is provided

will catch at us like strumpets and scald rimers
now Charmian
I am marble-constant now the fleeting moon

yes forsooth I wish you joy of the worm
if thus thou vanishest thou tell'st the world
dost thou not see my baby at my breast



have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves
before we proceed any further hear me speak


your suffering in this dearth you may as well
to scale't a little more
as well as speak it tauntingly replied

and through the cranks and offices of man
no public benefit which you receive

him vile that was your garland What's the matter

five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
our musty superfluity See our best elders
attend upon Cominius to these wars

mark'd you his lip and eyes
a place below the first for what miscarries

these three lead on this preparation
bring up your army but I think you'll find

with his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes
my ladies both good day to you
come lay aside your stitchery I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon
no good madam pardon me indeed I will not forth
well then farewell
for half a hundred years Summon the town

plaster you o'er that you may be abhorr'd
nor I
were not so rich a jewel Thou wast a soldier
see here these movers that do prize their hours
I will appear and fight
we shall be charg'd again Whiles we have struck
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
come I too late
where is that slave
they have plac'd their men of trust
that best can aid your action
as cause will be obey'd Please you to march

wert thou the Hector

in sign of what you are not to reward

then reason safely with you Therefore be it known
where ere we do repose us we will write

I would I were a Roman for I cannot
the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice



how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast
a letter for me It gives me an estate of seven years' health in which time I will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse-drench Is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded
wondrous ay I warrant you and not without his true purchasing

O 

give way there and go on

I warrant him consul
the napless vesture of humility
to him or our authorities For an end
what's the matter
how many stand for consulships
the present consul and last general
the theme of our assembly

to hear my nothings monster'd
an o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
and with a sudden re-enforcement struck
his deeds with doing them and is content
I do beseech you

come we'll inform them

from the noise of our own drums



the one part suffer'd the other will I do
worthy voices
you may sir
he has our voices sir
he said he had wounds which he could show in private
if he should still malignantly remain
did you perceive
get you hence instantly and tell those friends
cast your election on him

than stay past doubt for greater
that we shall hardly in our ages see


and straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices


in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate
a man of their infirmity

to know when two authorities are up
I'll give my reasons
to peck the eagles
to jump a body with a dangerous physic
let what is meet be said it must be meet

confusion's near I cannot speak You tribunes
the people are the city
of present death
that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
all will be naught else
though calv'd i' the porch o' the Capitol
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
I would they were in Tiber What the vengeance
he shall sure on't
he consul
should now eat up her own
being once gangren'd is not then respected

meet on the market-place We'll attend you there
you do the nobler


for them I cannot do it to the gods
it stands in like request
for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame

to have my praise for this perform a part
than thou of them Come all to ruin let
to answer mildly for they are prepar'd

assemble presently the people hither
go about it

to suffer lawful censure for such faults
well well no more
the fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people

to have t with saying Good morrow

you common cry of curs whose breath I hate
our enemy is banish'd he is gone Hoo hoo
with precepts that would make invincible
I have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld
where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
if I could shake off but one seven years
dismiss them home


will not have earth to know
but once a day it would unclog my heart
Nicanor No
he cannot choose I am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you you have ended my business and I will merrily accompany you home
save you sir
unseparable shall within this hour



no I serve not thy master

but with that surname a good memory
against my canker'd country with the spleen
and scarr'd the moon with splinters here I clip
from twelve to seventy and pouring war
and more a friend than e'er an enemy
nay it's no matter for that



hail to you both

Caius Marcius was
are enter'd in the Roman territories
lest you shall chance to whip your information
more fearful is deliver'd

your temples burned in their cement and

the tribunes cannot do't for shame the people

as you threw caps up will he tumble down


join'd in commission with him but either
the tribunes are no soldiers and their people
and power unto itself most commendable
yet one time he did call me by my name
I offer'd to awaken his regard
no I'll not meddle
I think he'll hear me Yet to bite his lip
he'll never hear him
stand and go back

howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have I am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass Therefore go back

take this along I writ it for thy sake
a noble fellow I warrant him
was to send him for whose old love I have
which can make gods forsworn I melt and am not
I have forgot my part and I am out

may show like all yourself
dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
are we come hither since that thy sight which should
thy wife and children's blood For myself son

to imitate the graces of the gods
to his surname Coriolanus longs more pride
but for your son believe it O believe it

there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub This Marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thing



the city ports by this hath enter'd and

presented to my knife his throat I took him
as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
say no more
he approaches you shall hear him
he hath abus'd your powers
look'd wondering each at other

shall have judicious hearing Stand Aufidius
tread not upon him Masters all be quiet
my rage is gone

I think I hear them Stand ho Who's there

and let us once again assail your ears
looks it not like the king mark it Horatio
'Tis gone and will not answer
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
but to recover of us by strong hand
was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
for which they say you spirits oft walk in death
it was about to speak when the cock crew

that we with wisest sorrow think on him
now for ourself and for this time of meeting


thou know'st tis common all that live must die
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet
this unprevailing woe and think of us
sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth
hail to your lordship
I would not hear your enemy say so
O where my lord
this marvel to you
these hands are not more like
to let you know of it




in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
to his unmaster'd importunity
and recks not his own rede
of each new-hatch'd unfledg'd comrade Beware
the time invites you go your servants tend
and that in way of caution I must tell you
my lord he hath importun'd me with love
do not believe his vows for they are brokers

this heavy-headed revel east and west
doth all the noble substance of a doubt
revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon

you shall not go my lord
have after To what issue will this come

and each particular hair to stand an end
and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that it went hand in hand even with the vow
and curd like eager droppings into milk
the glow-worm shows the matin to be near
my tables meet it is I set it down

ay by heaven my lord


never to speak of this that you have seen
than are dreamt of in your philosophy
with all my love I do commend me to you
inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris



my lord I have

then goes he to the length of all his arm
what have you given him any hard words of late
moreover that we much did long to see you
to whom he more adheres If it will please you
and I beseech you instantly to visit
the very cause of Hamlet's lunacy
say Voltimand what from our brother Norway
that it might please you to give quiet pass
I will be brief Your noble son is mad
"To the celestial and my soul's idol the most beautified Ophelia "
all given to mine ear
this must not be and then I precepts gave her


then I would you were so honest a man
between who






gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours You are welcome but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived


therugged Pyrrhus like the Hyrcanian beast
striking too short at Greeks his antique sword
and never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
run barefoot up and down threat'ning the flames


yet I
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
more relative than this the play s the thing
but with much forcing of his disposition
to hear him so inclin'd
that your good beauties be the happy cause
the harlot's cheek beautied with plastering art
that makes calamity of so long life
the fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
there my lord
I was the more deceived
the glass of fashion and the mould of form
haply the seas and countries different
madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go
will you two help to hasten them
to feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flatter'd
even with the very comment of thy soul


nothing

as woman's love
where love is great the littlest doubts are fear

the poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies

no no they do but jest poison in jest no offence i' the world
thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
lights lights lights






would quake to look on Soft now to my mother
to keep those many many bodies safe

though inclination be as sharp as will
and oft tis seen the wicked prise itself
to heaven
my words fly up my thoughts remain below
mother you have my father much offended
where you may see the inmost part of you

from the fair forehead of an innocent love
a combination and a form indeed
or but a sickly part of one true sense
O speak to me no more
alas he's mad
and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm

it will but skin and film the ulcerous place
that aptly is put on Refrain to-night
not this by no means that I bid you do

come sir to draw toward an end with you
O heavy deed
but we will ship him hence and this vile deed
safely stowed

I have sent to seek him and to find the body

nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar

as my great power thereof may give thee sense
I will do t my lord
we go to gain a little patch of ground

whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
I will not speak with her

alas sweet lady what imports this song
larded with sweet flowers
never departed more

wherein necessity of matter beggar'd
the ratifiers and props of every word
give me my father
dead
good Laertes

hey non nonny nonny hey nonny
there's fennel for you and columbines there's rue for you and here's some for me we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays O you must wear your rue with a difference There's a daisy I would give you some violets but they withered all when my father died They say he made a good end
and of all Christian souls I pray God God be wi' ye
no noble rite nor formal ostentation

so crimeful and so capital in nature


that I shall live and tell him to his teeth
the rather if you could devise it so
and they can well on horseback but this gallant
and gave you such a masterly report
not that I think you did not love your father
no place indeed should murder sanctuarize
under the moon can save the thing from death

as one incapable of her own distress
let's follow Gertrude

the gallows-maker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants
in youth when I did love did love
it might my lord
ay my lord and of calf-skins too
for no man sir
why because he was mad he shall recover his wits there or if he do not tis no great matter there
faith if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in he will last you some eight year or nine year a tanner will last you nine year
alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rises at it Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft Where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen Now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio tell me one thing
might stop a hole to keep the wind away
as we have warrantise her death was doubtful
when thou liest howling


woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself
let Hercules himself do what he may
that would not let me sleep methought I lay
with ho such bugs and goblins in my life
the effect of what I wrote
folded the writ up in form of the other
thrown out his angle for my proper life


what imports the nomination of this gentleman
rapier and dagger
sir I will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose I will win for him an I can if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits

not a whit we defy augury there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all Since no man has aught of what he leaves what is t to leave betimes Let be
sir in this audience
come one for me

come on sir
come
I dare not drink yet madam by and by

no no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet

that are but mutes or audience to this act
what war-like noise is this

you from the Polack wars and you from England
but let this same be presently perform'd
of your profession Speak what trade art thou
why sir cobble you
the livelong day with patient expectation
do kiss the most exalted shores of all

I shall remember

I am not gamesome I do lack some part
nor construe any further my neglect
have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes

think of this life but for my single self
the old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
another general shout
Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
both meet to hear and answer such high things
and all the rest look like a chidden train
would he were fatter but I fear him not

ay marry was t and he put it by thrice everytime gentler than other and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted
what said he when he came unto himself
will you dine with me to-morrow
to-morrow if you please to speak with me
for we will shake him or worse days endure
a common slave you know him well by sight
but men may construe things after their fashion
a very pleasing night to honest men
or else you use not You look pale and gaze

can be retentive to the strength of spirit
so vile a thing as C sar But O grief
and the complexion of the element

see Brutus at his house three parts of him

more than his reason But tis a common proof

shall Rome stand under one man's awe What Rome
are then in council and the state of man

you had but that opinion of yourself
here lies the east doth not the day break here
the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse
to think that or our cause or our performance

to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
when C sar's head is off

and I will bring him to the Capitol
good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
I am not well in health and that is all
that you unfold to me your self your half
that visit my sad heart
the secrets of my heart

set on your foot
what mean you C sar Think you to walk forth
and I do fear them
plucking the entrails of an offering forth
mark Antony shall say I am not well

in which so many smiling Romans bath'd
and reason to my love is liable

good friends go in and taste some wine with me
to know my errand madam


the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise

he wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive

with that which melteth fools I mean sweet words
to beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber

fly not stand still ambition's debt is paid
do so and let no man abide this deed
and let us bathe our hands in C sar's blood
ay every man away
thorough the hazards of this untrod state

as by our hands and this our present act

it would become me better than to close

Brutus a word with you
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us
which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips

into the market-place there shall I try
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons

save I alone till Antony have spoke
nay that's certain
come I to speak in C sar's funeral
O judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
there's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
yea beg a hair of him for memory
will you be patient Will you stay awhile

through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd
our C sar's vesture wounded Look you here
peace there Hear the noble Antony
and bid them speak for me but were I Brutus

here was a C sar when comes such another


that's as much as to say they are fools that marry you'll bear me a bang for that I fear Proceed directly
I am Cinna the poet I am Cinna the poet

Octavius I have seen more days than you
he must be taught and train'd and bid go forth
stand ho
he is not doubted A word Lucilius
the greater part the horse in general
judge me you gods Wrong I mine enemies
let Lucius and Titinius guard our door
you know that you are Brutus that speak this
Brutus bay not me
must I give way and room to your rash choler
I shall be glad to learn of noble men
do not presume too much upon my love
dash him to pieces
as huge as high Olympus
do what you will dishonour shall be humour
have not you love enough to bear with me
for shame you generals What do you mean
and come yourselves and bring Messala with you
how scap'd I killing when I cross'd you so



even so great men great losses should endure
do stand but in a forc'd affection
on such a full sea are we now afloat
farewell good Messala
farewell every one

it is my duty sir

why I will see thee at Philippi then
nothing my lord

to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
stand fast Titinius we must out and talk
the posture of your blows are yet unknown

join'd with a masquer and a reveller

a canopy most fatal under which
even by the rule of that philosophy
if we do meet again why we shall smile

they are my lord

now be a freeman and with this good sword

why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
and bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts

yet countrymen O yet hold up your heads

this is not Brutus friend but I assure you
peace then no words
come hither good Volumnius list a word

fly my lord fly

Octavius then take him to follow thee


unburden'd crawl toward death Our son of Cornwall
a love that makes breath poor and speech unable

nothing will come of nothing speak again
but goes thy heart with this
as thou my sometime daughter
the sway revenue execution of the rest
nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound

to shield thee from diseases of the world
here's France and Burgundy my noble lord
I know no answer
this is most strange
a still-soliciting eye and such a tongue
nothing I have sworn I am firm
thou losest here a better where to find
prescribe not us our duties
'Tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself
my mind as generous and my shape as true
upon the gad Edmund how now what news


this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behaviour we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we were villains by necessity fools by heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail and my nativity was under ursa major so that it follows I am rough and lecherous Sfoot I should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing Edgar
ay two hours together
a credulous father and a brother noble

that I may speak I'll write straight to my sister



since my young lady's going into France sir the fool hath much pined him away
I'll not be struck my lord
why fool
have more than thou showest
a bitter fool

and I for sorrow sung



by her that else will take the thing she begs
ingratitude thou marble-hearted fiend
of what hath mov'd you
now gods that we adore whereof comes this
beweep this cause again I'll pluck ye out

not fear still to be taken I know his heart
though I condemn not yet under pardon




my father watches O sir fly this place
of my more fierce endeavour I have seen drunkards

my worthy arch and patron comes to-night



you we first seize on
I serve you madam
why dost thou use me thus I know thee not
strike you slave stand rogue stand you neat slave strike
what is your difference speak


an they will take it so if not he's plain
when he conjunct and flattering his displeasure
stocking his messenger
for pilferings and most common trespasses
a good man's fortune may grow out at heels

sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers


the leisure of their answer gave me cold looks



no but not yet may be he is not well

thy sister's naught O Regan she hath tied
O sir you are old
look'd black upon me struck me with her tongue
to grudge my pleasures to cut off my train
this is a slave whose easy-borrow'd pride
all's not offence that indiscretion finds
to wage against the enmity o' the air
in my corrupted blood But I'll not chide thee
speak gainst so great a number How in one house
with five-and-twenty Regan said you so
are in the poorest thing superfluous
shall break into a hundred thousand flaws

and what they may incense him to being apt
this night wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch
or the hard rein which both of them have borne
for confirmation that I am much more
vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts
he that has a house to put his head in has a good head-piece
alas sir are you here things that love night
more sinn'd against than sinning
he that has a little tiny wit
when usurers tell their gold i' the field
that which my father loses no less than all
the lesser is scarce felt Thou'dst shun a bear


couldst thou save nothing Didst thou give them all

and aroint thee witch aroint thee
the prince of darkness is a gentleman
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban
the grief hath craz'd my wits What a night's this

go with me to the duchess
a king a king
come o'er the bourn Bessy to me
bench by his side
cry you mercy I took you for a joint-stool

and I'll go to bed at noon
which if convenience will not allow
in thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee
are gone with him toward Dover where they boast
bind fast his corky arms
naughty lady
cunning
in hell-black night endur'd would have buoy'd up
I have serv'd you ever since I was a child

how is t my lord How look you
to apply to his bleeding face Now heaven help him
these fourscore years

how should this be
above the rest be gone
here take this purse thou whom the heavens' plagues

which tie him to an answer Our wishes on the way

whose reverence the head-lugg'd bear would lick

slain by his servant going to put out

ay my good lord twas he inform'd against him
ay sir she took them read them in my presence
faith once or twice she heav'd the name of father'
well sir the poor distress'd Lear's i' the town
well sir I'll bring you to our master Lear

it is thy business that I go about


if you do find him pray you give him this
hark do you hear the sea
show scarce so gross as beetles half way down
well worth a poor man's taking fairies and gods

hast heavy substance bleed'st not speak'st art sound
too well too well


to hear of pleasure's name
were all the letters suns I could not see
thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
we waul and cry I will preach to thee mark
you shall have any thing
who redeems nature from the general curse
though that the queen on special cause is here
the bounty and the benison of heaven


that of thy death and business I can tell
all my reports go with the modest truth
the untun'd and jarring senses O wind up

had not concluded all He wakes speak to him
I am mightily abus'd I should even die with pity
for as I am a man I think this lady
you see is kill'd in him and yet it is danger

now sweet lord
fear me not
combine together gainst the enemy

the enemy's in view draw up your powers
the battle done and they within our power

who loses and who wins who's in who's out
go follow them to prison
who were the opposites of this day's strife






I come to cope
a most toad-spotted traitor Say thou No
by the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer

methought thy very gait did prophesy
led him begg'd for him sav'd him from despair
to amplify too much would make much more

here comes Kent
alack why thus
give it the captain
is this the promis'd end
gentle and low an excellent thing in woman
he'll strike and quickly too He's dead and rotten
very bootless
and thou no breath at all Thou'lt come no more
he but usurp'd his life


for brave Macbeth well he deserves that name


the victory fell on us

and the very ports they blow
Macbeth doth come
that you are so
your favours nor your hate
a prosperous gentleman and to be king
you shall be king
we are sent
he labour'd in his country's wrack I know not
in deepest consequence
but what is not
think upon what hath chanc'd and at more time
to throw away the dearest thing he ow'd
in doing it pays itself Your highness' part
we will establish our estate upon
which the eye fears when it is done to see
than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither
give him tending

look like the time bear welcome in your eye
by his lov'd mansionry that the heaven's breath
we rest your hermits
it were done quickly if the assassination
striding the blast or heaven's cherubin hors'd
not cast aside so soon
when you durst do it then you were a man
that memory the warder of the brain
I am settled and bend up

to you they have show'd some truth

it is the bloody business which informs
that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold


after these ways so it will make us mad
they must lie there go carry them and smear
the multitudinous seas incarnadine
wake Duncan with thy knocking I would thou couldst
is thy master stirring
the labour we delight in physics pain
'Twas a rough night
mean you his majesty
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak
all is but toys renown and grace is dead

look to the lady
against the undivulg'd pretence I fight
the nearer bloody
that darkness does the face of earth entomb

he is already nam'd and gone to Scone
God's benison go with you and with those
to-night we hold a solemn supper sir
for a dark hour or twain
let every man be master of his time
my genius is rebuk'd as it is said

our point of second meeting Do you find
not i' the worst rank of manhood say it
true my lord
I will advise you where to plant yourselves
is Banquo gone from court

be bright and jovial among your guests to-night
the shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
but who did bid thee join with us
already are i' the court
O treachery Fly good Fleance fly fly fly

is he dispatch'd



this is the air-drawn dagger which you said

I drink to the general joy of the whole table
take any shape but that and my firm nerves

almost at odds with morning which is which

but make amends now get you gone

that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
to wake Northumberland and war-like Siward
fly to the court of England and unfold

liver of blaspheming Jew
like elves and fairies in a ring
though castles topple on their warders' heads
her nine farrow grease that's sweaten
more potent than the first

can tell so much shall Banquo's issue ever
thou art too like the spirit of Banquo down
I'll charm the air to give a sound

his wife his babes and all unfortunate souls
from whence himself does fly He loves us not
blessing upon you


if he were dead you'd weep for him if you would not it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father
accounted dangerous folly why then alas
run away I pray you
you may deserve of him through me and wisdom
let not my jealousies be your dishonours
when I shall tread upon the tyrant's head
luxurious avaricious false deceitful
finding it so inclin'd
but I have none the king-becoming graces
since that the truest issue of thy throne
the taints and blames I laid upon myself

put on with holy prayers and tis spoken

how does my wife
would create soldiers make our women fight
pertains to you alone

dispute it like a man

lo you here she comes This is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep Observe her stand close
do you mark that
wash your hands put on your night-gown look not so pale I tell you yet again Banquo's buried he cannot come out on s grave
I think but dare not speak

itself for being there
and mingle with the English epicures
the English force so please you

raze out the written troubles of the brain
makes us hear something
the numbers of our host and make discovery
that will with due decision make us know
I have almost forgot the taste of fears
that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
within this three mile may you see it coming
now near enough your leavy screens throw down

but swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn
we have met with foes

then yield thee coward

had I as many sons as I have hairs


'I have already chose my officer
why there's no remedy tis the curse of the service
and throwing but shows of service on their lords
proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
what is the matter there
not I what are you
what tell'st thou me of robbing this is Venice
as partly I find it is that your fair daughter
strike on the tinder ho
which is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him
of some such thing
sometimes to do me service Nine or ten times
shall out-tongue his complaints Tis yet to know


have with you

subdue him at his peril
I am sure is sent for
as in these cases where the aim reports
how say you by this change

write from us to him post-post-haste dispatch
why what's the matter
stood in your action
hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
it is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
I do beseech you
her father lov'd me oft invited me
which ever as she could with haste dispatch
and I lov'd her that she did pity them
to you I am bound for life and education
let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
but words are words I never yet did hear

did I my soul and fortunes consecrate
and all indign and base adversities
with what else needful your good grace shall think
come Desdemona I have but an hour


in double knavery how how Let's see
if it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea
that their designment halts a noble ship of Venice
for I have serv'd him and the man commands
of very expert and approv'd allowance


enwheel thee round


come on assay There's one gone to the harbour
worse and worse
she that in wisdom never was so frail
lo where he comes
but that our loves and comforts should increase
in mine own comforts I prithee good Iago
lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together Villanous thoughts Roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you to-night for the command I'll lay t upon you Cassio knows you not I'll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister
not out of absolute lust though peradventure
knavery's plain face is never seen till us'd
that profit's yet to come twixt me and you

he'll be as full of quarrel and offence
some wine ho
I am for it lieutenant and I'll do you justice

the one as long as the other tis pity of him



he that stirs next to carve for his own rage

and passion having my best judgment collied
yet I persuade myself to speak the truth
as men in rage strike those that wish them best



all seals and symbols of redeemed sin
how now Roderigo
I'll set her on

I shall seem to notify unto her
I humbly thank you for t
with Desdemona alone

ay but lady

that he would steal away so guilty-like

why then to-morrow night or Tuesday morn
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves
excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul
O yes and went between us very oft
too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something

I am not bound to that all slaves are free to
it were not for your quiet nor your good

is once to be resolved Exchange me for a goat
I would not have your free and noble nature
for too much loving you
my lord I see you're mov'd

let me be thought too busy in my fears
that we can call these delicate creatures ours
why do you speak so faintly
for he conjur'd her she should ever keep it


not poppy nor mandragora
he that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n

greater than that
as Dian's visage is now begrim'd and black
more than their own What then how then
one of this kind is Cassio
I'll tear her all to pieces
now do I see tis true Look here Iago
till that a capable and wide revenge
within these three days let me hear thee say
he is a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing


you may indeed say so





exist and be a member of his love
what I can do I will and more I will
hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
they are not ever jealous for the cause
and I was going to your lodging Cassio
from whence you have them You are jealous now

an hour or more not meaning any harm
but for the handkerchief

my medicine work Thus credulous fools are caught
I would on great occasion speak with you
which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
he hath and is again to cope your wife

I never knew woman love man so
so so so so They laugh that win
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber O I see that nose of yours but not the dog I shall throw it to

and did you see the handkerchief



is there division twixt my lord and Cassio


concerning this sir O well-painted passion
he's that he is I may not breathe my censure
I am sorry that I am deceiv'd in him
to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
and yet she'll kneel and pray I have seen her do t
upon my knees what doth your speech import
Ah Desdemona away away away
where either I must live or bear no life
I should make very forges of my cheeks
no as I shall be sav'd
faith half asleep


beshrew him for it
and put in every honest hand a whip
or that I do not yet and ever did
go in and weep not all things shall be well


O pardon me twill do me good to walk
and bade me to dismiss you
come come you talk
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
nay that's not next Hark who is it that knocks


it is so too and have not we affections
and yet he has given me satisfying reasons
that thrust had been mine enemy indeed
thou teachest me Minion your dear lies dead

what are you here that cry so grievously

my leg is cut in two
lend me a garter So O for a chair
that so neglected you



be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee
alas my lord what may you mean by that
when your eyes roll so Why I should fear I know not
thou gav'st to Cassio
and have you mercy too I never did


I would not have thee linger in thy pain


sweet Desdemona O sweet mistress speak

thy husband
my husband say that she was false
as ignorant as dirt thou hast done a deed

'Tis a strange truth
that e'er did lift up eye
it was a handkerchief an antique token
O thou dull Moor that handkerchief thou speak'st of

hark canst thou hear me I will play the swan

from the possession of this heavenly sight

will you I pray demand that demi-devil

there is besides in Roderigo's letter
speak of me as I am nothing extenuate


no for then we should be colliers
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men


put up your swords you know not what you do

have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
I drew to part them in the instant came
I measuring his affections by my own
I neither know it nor can learn of him

out of her favour where I am in love





she is the hopeful lady of my earth


stay fellow I can read
sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st
I'll go along no such sight to be shown
I have remember'd me thou's hear our counsel
that shall she marry I remember it well
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit

the valiant Paris seeks you for his love
for fair without the fair within to hide

with nimble soles I have a soul of lead



time out o' mind the fairies' coach-makers
that plats the manes of horses in the night
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves


his son was but a ward two years ago
come hither cover'd with an antick face
here in my house do him disparagement
this trick may chance to scathe you I know what
and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss
you kiss by the book
nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone



by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
her vestal livery is but sick and green

nor arm nor face nor any other part
because it is an enemy to thee

thou know'st the mask of night is on my face
and not impute this yielding to light love
I have no joy of this contract to-night
but to be frank and give it thee again
where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
a thousand times the worse to want thy light
shall I send to thee
so loving-jealous of his liberty
now ere the sun advance his burning eye
for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
or if not so then here I hit it right
be plain good son and homely in thy drift
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
the other did not so
torments him so that he will sure run mad

a most courteous exposition
thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not here for the goose
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large



I will tell her sir that you do protest which as I take it is a gentlemanlike offer

Peter
my words would bandy her to my sweet love

lord how my head aches what a head have I


here comes the lady O so light a foot
conceit more rich in matter than in words
come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved

your worship in that sense may call him man
alla stoccata carries it away

they have made worms' meat of me I have it

stand not amaz'd the prince will doom thee death
there lies the man slain by young Romeo
and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
I beg for justice which thou prince must give
bear hence this body and attend our will
come night come Romeo come thou day in night

hath Romeo slain himself say thou but I
O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
despised substance of divinest show
for tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds

affliction is enamour'd of thy parts

and little mouse every unworthy thing

thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel

stand up stand up stand an you be a man
as if that name
why rail'st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
the law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend


sir Paris I will make a desperate tender

do lace the severing clouds in yonder east

the day is broke be wary look about
I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
who is't that calls is it my lady mother
feeling so the loss
then weep no more I'll send to one in Mantua
and joy comes well in such a needy time
I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
have you deliver'd to her our decree
to go with Paris to Saint Peter's church
God in heaven bless her
alone in company still my care hath been

some comfort nurse
or else beshrew them both
I'll to the friar to know his remedy
may be put from her by society

thy face is mine and thou hast slander'd it
on Thursday next be married to this county

things that to hear them told have made me tremble
thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours
in this resolve I'll send a friar with speed
we shall be much unfurnish'd for this time
send for the county go tell him of this

which well thou know'st is cross and full of sin
nurse What should she do here
or if I live is it not very like
seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
all night for lesser cause and ne'er been sick
I have a head sir that will find out logs
why love I say madam sweet-heart why bride
what is the matter

and doth it give me such a sight as this

she's not well married that lives married long
move them no more by crossing their high will


then music with her silver sound

I do beseech you sir have patience
sharp misery had worn him to the bones



unhappy fortune by my brotherhood
yet put it out for I would not be seen
the boy gives warning something doth approach
the time and my intents are savage-wild
that murder'd my love's cousin with which grief

or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet
than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
here's to my love
Romeo
Romeo
hath thwarted our intents come come away
lead boy which way
but the true ground of all these piteous woes
what should it be that they so shriek abroad
is empty on the back of Montague
till we can clear these ambiguities
was Tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death
came I to take her from her kindred's vault
I brought my master news of Juliet's death
of a poor pothecary and therewithal

which manifold record not matches See
when we for recompense have prais'd the vile
upon the heels of my presentment sir
lives in these touches livelier than life

to propagate their states amongst them all
drink the free air
ay my good lord five talents is his debt


she is young and apt
for tis a bond in men Give him thy daughter
your lordship to accept
it would unclew me quite
good morrow to thee gentle Apemantus




traffic's thy god and thy god confound thee
into baboon and monkey

the very heart of kindness
then as in grateful virtue I am bound
than my fortunes to me

lest they should spy my wind-pipe's dangerous notes
or my friends if I should need em


they dance they are mad women
I am to thank you for t
more jewels yet

may it please your honour Lord Lucius
his promises fly so beyond his state
good words the other day of a bay courser

I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
he owes nine thousand besides my former sum
'Commend me to your master' and the cap

is't not your business too
of Athens here my lord
from Isidore

how dost fool
asses



at many leisures I propos'd
the greatest of your having lacks a half
call me before the exactest auditors

my lord my lord




has friendship such a faint and milky heart
how
he cannot want fifty-five hundred talents
do you observe this Hostilius
I never tasted Timon in my life
they have all been touch'd and found base metal for
I'd such a courage to do him good But now return
what do we meet together
is not my lord seen yet

your master's confidence was above mine

for you serve knaves

all our bills
tear me take me and the gods fall upon you
I'll once more feast the rascals




and cherish factions tis inferr'd to us

banish your dotage banish usury
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds

my noble lord
how do you What's the news
will't hold will't hold

push did you see my cap
let me look back upon thee O thou wall
and let confusion live Plagues incident to men
amen
a dedicated beggar to the air

of monstrous friends
the want that makes him lean Who dares who dares
pluck stout men's pillows from below their head

for all her cherubin look

to the tub-fast and the diet
why fare thee well
will o'er some high-vic'd city hang his poison

and be no turncoats yet may your pains six months
of him that his particular to foresee
I never did thee harm
with all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
'Tis then because thou dost not keep a dog


if thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
the icy precepts of respect but follow'd
art thou proud yet
'Tis not well mended so it is but botch'd
would poison were obedient and knew my mind
I understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog
when there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus

that death in me at others' lives may laugh


why should you want Behold the earth hath roots
like workmen I'll example you with thievery


because thou art a woman and disclaim'st
I fell with curses
either in hope or present I'd exchange
curses stay not fly whilst thou'rt bless'd and free

'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam
to their whole being I am rapt and cannot cover


that he's a made-up villain
if thou would not reside
the former man may make him Bring us to him

ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
against the walls of Athens
as thieves to keepers

from high to low throughout that whoso please

and made us speak like friends this man was riding
I cannot read the character I'll take with wax

for private faults in them
with those that have offended like a shepherd
then there's my glove

 

returns the good Andronicus to Rome
commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd

make way to lay them by their brethren
victorious Titus rue the tears I shed
religiously they ask a sacrifice
may favour Tamora the Queen of Goths
no noise but silence and eternal sleep
gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome
a better head her glorious body fits

I ask your voices and your suffrages

mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet
can make you greater than the Queen of Goths
this prince in justice seizeth but his own

I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once
dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome
sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine

what would you bury him in my despite



is in opinion and in honour wrong'd
and basely put it up without revenge
I'll find a day to massacre them all
this day all quarrels die Andronicus
I will not be denied sweet heart look back
now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top
to wait said I to wanton with this queen
clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peace
nor would your noble mother for much more
that for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
to achieve her how
would serve your turns
you must perforce accomplish as you may
the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
I have been troubled in my sleep this night
our Roman hunting
and so repose sweet gold for their unrest
whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
seest thou this letter take it up I pray thee
thy temples should be planted presently

a barren detested vale you see it is
this vengeance on me had they executed
and with that painted hope she braves your mightiness
listen fair madam let it be your glory
the whilst their own birds famish in their nests
for tis not life that I have begg'd so long

what art thou fall'n What subtle hole is this
my heart suspects more than mine eye can see
which like a taper in some monument
thou canst not come to me I come to thee
where is my lord the king
which overshades the mouth of that same pit
I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed
Andronicus I will entreat the king

Ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame
or had he heard the heavenly harmony
for two and twenty sons I never wept

when I do weep they humbly at my feet
but who comes with our brother Marcus here
my grief was at the height before thou cam'st
O say thou for her who hath done this deed
now I behold thy lively body so
and thou and I sit round about some fountain
thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
and that shall be the ransom for their fault
then have I kept it to a worthy end
then I'll go fetch an axe
and yet dear too because I bought mine own
and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds
then must my earth with her continual tears
to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal
Ah now no more will I control thy griefs
you heavy people circle me about
but now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives

how Troy was burnt and he made miserable
make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale
but how if that fly had a father and a mother
that comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor
ay when my father was in Rome she did
loves me as dear as e'er my mother did
confederate in the fact ay more there was
Lavinia wert thou thus surpris'd sweet girl
my lord look here look here Lavinia
tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides
and when he sleeps will she do what she list
presents that I intend to send them both
Demetrius here's the son of Lucius
the hope of Rome for so he bade me say

had he not reason Lord Demetrius
belike for joy the emperor hath a son

villain what hast thou done

can never turn the swan's black legs to white

then sit we down and let us all consult
'Weke weke

I'll make you feed on berries and on roots
tell him it is for justice and for aid
join with the Goths and with revengeful war
and sith there's no justice in earth nor hell
good boy in Virgo's lap give it Pallas


knock at my door and tell me what he says
this to Apollo this to the god of war
for these contempts
how much money must I have


if Tamora entreat him then he will
and temper him with all the art I have
be bold in us we'll follow where thou lead'st
had nature lent thee but thy mother's look
and by his side his fruit of bastardy
an if it please thee why assure thee Lucius
which I have seen thee careful to observe
and cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st
and what not done that thou hast cause to rue
even now I curse the day and yet I think

the Roman emperor greets you all by me
and work confusion on his enemies
witness these trenches made by grief and care
art thou Revenge and art thou sent to me
so thou destroy Rapine and Murder there
for now he firmly takes me for Revenge
but welcome as you are What shall we do
well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion
go gentle Marcus to thy nephew Lucius



what would you say if I should let you speak
receive the blood and when that they are dead
for testimony of her foul proceedings
the feast is ready which the careful Titus
an if your highness knew my heart you were
what hast thou done unnatural and unkind
whereof their mother daintily hath fed
do shameful execution on herself
here is a captain let him tell the tale
alas you know I am no vaunter I
will hand in hand all headlong cast us down
thanks gentle Romans may I govern so
many a matter hath he told to thee
there let him stand and rave and cry for food
but throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey
